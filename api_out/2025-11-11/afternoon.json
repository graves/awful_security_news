On Monday, she sat down with Trump and scrutinized several of his policy proposals, channeling dissension within the pro-Trump ranks — and seemingly catching the president off guard.\n \n\n   \n  Sounding skeptical of Trump’s “costs are way down” defensiveness, the conservative Fox host asked, “Are you saying voters are misperceiving how they feel?”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham also asked about his stance on the government shutdown, his demolition of the East Wing, and his understanding of Christianity.\n \n\n   \n  After she brought up two issues of particular concern to her MAGA media allies, Trump said, “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea. I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham’s approach was in keeping with the tone of her nightly Fox show: She often tries to steer Trump in what she believes is a more productive, ultimately politically successful direction.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was elected in 2016, Ingraham held talks about becoming his press secretary, but she insisted on having a seat at the policymaking table as well. The transition team couldn’t agree on how to make room for her, and Sean Spicer was hired as press secretary instead.\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham has arguably been more influential on the outside, nudging Trump via the television, and occasionally in person.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s interview, when Trump tried to downplay the impacts of recent air travel chaos, she interjected: “There are a lot of delays now, sir.”\n \n\n   \n  She generally framed her questions in a positive light for the president, while still conveying the concerns of Republican voters.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Ingraham brought up voter anxiety about affordability, as seen in last week’s off-year election results. “I know you’ve been all over” the issue, she said, and some prices are “way down,” but “other things, as you noted, have gone up.”\n \n\n   \n  “Is this a voter perception issue of the economy,” she asked, “or is there more that needs to be done by Republicans on Capitol Hill or done in terms of policy?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested a perception problem, saying, “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats.”\n \n\n   \n  But Ingraham wasn’t buying it. She said Joe Biden was criticized — including by Trump — for “saying things were great, and things weren’t great.”\n \n\n   \n  A little bit later on, she directly asked, “Why are people saying they’re anxious about the economy? Why are they saying that?” Trump rejected the premise of the question.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know that they are” saying that, the president claimed. “I think polls are fake. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also waved off Ingraham’s critical question about a recent proposal by Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte for 50-year mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  This idea “has enraged your MAGA friends,” Ingraham pointed out, describing the “significant MAGA backlash” from people who are “calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump didn’t want to hear it. Of the 50-year mortgage proposal, he said, “it’s not even a big deal. I mean, you know, you go from 40 to 50 years and—”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham corrected him: From “30 to 50” years.\n \n\n   \n  “All it means is, you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time,” Trump said. “It’s not like a big factor. It might help a little bit, but the problem was that Biden did this.”\n \n\n   \n  Then Trump went on to bash Biden some more.\n \n\n   \n  However, Ingraham was more interested in hearing the current president’s views about contentious topics.\n \n\n   \n  She broached conservative disdain for American colleges and universities and said “a lot of MAGA folks, um, are not thrilled about this idea of hundreds of thousands of foreign students in the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fox host specifically raised Trump’s plan to grant student visas for 600,000 Chinese college students, which Trump has justified as a business transaction.\n \n\n   \n  “I know you and I disagree” on this, he said to Ingraham. “We’re never gonna agree on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-agents-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:21:00-05:00","title":"Border Patrol Officials Plan to Leave Chicago as Part of National Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official, is planning to leave Chicago as early as this week to conduct further immigration enforcement operations in other cities, including Charlotte, North Carolina, and later New Orleans.

What you need to know \n       \n  By David Goldman, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:35 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growing  affordability problems , has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n \n\n   \n  “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump  posted on Truth Social  Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump proposed\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could  receive a portion of the tariff revenue .\n \n\n   \n  “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.\n \n\n   \n  The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.\n \n\n   \n    What the Treasury says\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.\n \n\n   \n    Who qualifies and is there even enough money for this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.\n \n\n   \n  More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the  IRS said .\n \n\n   \n  So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.\n \n\n   \n  “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What about the Supreme Court?\n \n\n   \n  Another complicating factor: The  Supreme Court appears skeptical  of the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.\n \n\n   \n  If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to  return that money to businesses , which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.\n \n\n   \n  It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do this unilaterally?\n \n\n   \n  Almost certainly not.\n \n\n   \n  Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.\n \n\n   \n    Would Congress support it?\n \n\n   \n  Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.\n \n\n   \n  Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say  inflation and affordability  are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.\n \n\n   \n    When would my check come?\n \n\n   \n  Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.\n \n\n   \n  During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/sonder-bankruptcy-marriott-deal-ends","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00-05:00","title":"Collapse of Sonder, a Marriott-backed hotel chain, leaves guests stranded mid-stay","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sonder, a short-term rental company valued at $1 billion and once seen as a major Airbnb rival, collapsed after its 20-year licensing agreement with Marriott ended due to severe financial difficulties.

D’Aoust probably didn’t expect his anniversary trip to end early, but he definitely didn’t think he’d have just 15 minutes to vacate his room.\n \n\n   \n  The early ejection wasn’t because of a fire or a fight, but a bankruptcy. Sonder, a short-term rentals company abruptly collapsed over the weekend when its partnership with Marriott ended, leaving many guests stranded mid-stay.\n \n\n   \n  D’Aoust was staying the weekend at a Sonder property in Montréal, Canada, when he got an  email  last Sunday afternoon that he needed to vacate his room by Monday at 9 am. That’s because Sonder’s licensing agreement with Marriott was “no longer in effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the staff if we could still stay until our checkout at 11 am, but the staff explained he had only received instructions to empty the building ASAP and that unfortunately we only had 10 to 15 minutes,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  D’Aoust is just one of the many travelers affected by Sonder’s shutdown following the sudden end of a deal with Marriott, which had let guests book and earn loyalty points at Sonder’s 9,000 furnished apartments and boutique hotel rooms in 40 cities across 10 countries.\n \n\n   \n  Marriott said in a  statement  Sunday that the planned 20-year licensing agreement had ended because of Sonder’s “default,” a.k.a. financial difficulties.\n \n\n   \n  The 2024 deal should’ve had been a boon for Sonder, which was  once valued at $1 billion  and considered a major Airbnb rival. Sonder sought to strike the sweet spot between a hotel and an Airbnb, offering guests the convenience of an all-digital check-in experience but for smaller properties ideal for solo travelers. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and a rough go in the  public markets  in 2022 ultimately spelled its doom. Sonder was relying on the strength of Marriott’s booking platform to give it a much-needed boost.\n \n\n   \n  Sonder said in a statement Monday that it’s “winding down operations immediately” and entering Chapter 7, a complete liquidation of its business. The company blamed “severe financial constraints arising from, among other things, prolonged challenges in the integration of the company’s systems and booking arrangements with Marriott.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories of guests being stranded mid-stay at Sonder properties are  littered  across social media, mostly putting the blame on Marriott. A Marriott spokesperson told CNN that it’s worked “tirelessly to remain informed about Sonder’s financial situation and develop action plans so that we can work to meet the needs of our guests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Marriott is in communication with guests who have existing reservations at Sonder properties booked on Marriott.com and through other Marriott channels, and we are in contact with third-party platforms to communicate with guests who booked on other channels,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  For D’Aoust, that meant an early ending to his weekend away and a two-hour drive back home to Ottawa. But he’s thankful it was just one day lost, and he only missed out on a breakfast reservation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d imagine it’s a little more stressful for folks that had much longer stays,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:14:00-05:00","title":"Tracking states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican officials have launched an unprecedented redistricting campaign across multiple states to protect their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The latest development is in Utah, where a judge rejected a proposed map drawn by the state’s Republican legislature and  ordered the use of one  which is likely to create a Democratic seat. Utah had to create a new map after a ruling that the map drawn by the state legislature in 2021 violated an anti-gerrymandering ballot measure.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps.

    \n  By René Marsh, Dianne Gallagher, Michael Williams, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:33 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Onita Norris is constantly running the numbers to try to solve a problem with no good answer: Figuring out much her two children, both under five, will have to eat, and how much she will have to go without.\n \n\n   \n  The West Virginia single mother earns about $2,800 a month working 40 hours weekly for the state. About half of that goes toward rent. The rest is for daycare and her electric, water and phone bills, leaving her only about $100 from her paycheck for other expenses, including groceries.\n \n\n   \n  Aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, usually adds $265 to her monthly budget for food. But with benefits disrupted  as the government lurches into what is now its longest shutdown on record, Norris now must find other ways to feed her family.\n \n\n   \n  “Rather than myself having, like, a full plate of food along with my kids, I’m making sure that they have a full plate of food,” Norris said. “I may have either less, or I may not eat.”\n \n\n   \n  Tears come to her face as she worries she’s failing her children. “It feels like I’m failing them because I am trying, I’m trying to do all that I can, and, of course, as a human you get frustrated,” she said, “and I never want my kids to see that, or feel like I’m taking that out on them, for something as simple as dinner.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 40 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps, to pay for food. They are caught in the middle of a protracted budget  standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have, for more than a month,  been unable to come up with an agreement that would fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  The difficult circumstances SNAP recipients are facing have become one of the most pressing issues for lawmakers, who are under pressure to work harder toward an agreement to get the benefits fully funded again.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the state that was the first testing ground in 1961 for what is now SNAP, some 15% of its 1.7 million   residents rely on the benefits today.\n \n\n   \n  Food banks in the state are struggling to meet demand. They were already dealing with budget cuts caused by federal belt tightening    toward the beginning of the year. Now, things are even more stretched as furloughed federal workers become new clients.\n \n\n   \n  One charity in Martinsburg, CCAP/Loaves & Fishes, saw the number of households it serves roughly double from 72 households per week to 159 in the third week of October, and 119 in the fourth.\n \n\n   \n  Even though it is better positioned than other pantries thanks to the generosity of the community and local churches, there are worries about how long it can continue to keep serving at such a rate.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the SNAP benefits are replenished, the federal workers go back to work, we’re going to be just slammed like this all day,” its president, Leigh Fleming, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s a struggle out here’\n \n\n   \n  Following a court order, the Trump administration earlier this week said it would  partially fund SNAP for November.  But the funds won’t cover full benefits, and November payments for millions of Americans who rely on them have been delayed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then appeared to threaten to withhold SNAP funding on Tuesday until Democrats voted to reopen the government. The White House later clarified the administration would follow through on its plan to fund partial food aid during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the federal government’s responses have brought confusion and dismay.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t feel as though the folks at Washington quite understand the gravity of the situation,” said Norris. “I just don’t understand how we’ve come to a point where we’re using food in politics and being essentially political pawns.”\n \n\n   \n  Laura Bowles, a West Virginia mother of five children aged four to 13 — with a sixth on the way — said she had to explain to her older kids that “there are some right now in the government who can’t figure things out, and we can’t have everything we used to have right now.”\n \n\n   \n  For her family, it means having to buy less food. “My kids eat a lot,” she said. “And groceries are already so expensive these days — it was already hard,” Bowles said. Like Norris, she is cutting back her own food intake to make her kids’ meals stretch further.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband’s paycheck from Walmart, where he works full time and makes $14 an hour, usually covers all their household bills.\n \n\n   \n  But this month, without SNAP, it’s mostly going to groceries. That means the family has had to pick what other bills to pay.\n \n\n   \n  “I let my trash and internet bill slide already,” said Bowles. Only half the electricity and car insurance could be covered, she added, and the family are even cutting back on driving to the park to save money on gas.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn’t part of the plan – but it was God’s plan,” she said. “I guess people struggle everywhere, but it’s hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/uk-suspends-caribbean-intelligence-sharing-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:42:00.000-05:00","title":"Exclusive: UK suspends some intelligence sharing with US over boat strike concerns in major break","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Kingdom has suspended intelligence sharing with the United States regarding suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean, citing deep concern over the legality of US military strikes launched in September 2025.

That meant the ships would be stopped, boarded, its crew detained, and drugs seized.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence was typically sent to Joint Interagency Task Force South, a task force stationed in Florida that includes representatives from a number of partner nations and works to reduce the illicit drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  But shortly after the US began launching lethal strikes against the boats in September, however, the UK grew concerned that the US might use intelligence provided by the British to select targets. British officials believe the US military strikes, which have killed 76 people, violate international law, the sources said. The intelligence pause began over a month ago, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last month that the strikes violate international law and amount to “extrajudicial killing.” The UK agrees with that assessment, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The British embassy in Washington and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official told CNN that the department “doesn’t talk about intelligence matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, Cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights — something the UK was happy to help with, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration has argued that the US military can legally kill suspected traffickers because they pose an imminent threat to Americans and are “enemy combatants” who are in an “armed conflict” with the US, according to a memo sent by the administration to Congress. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel  issued an opinion , which is still classified, reinforcing that argument, CNN has reported, and Trump has designated a number of drug cartels as “foreign terrorist groups.” The White House has said repeatedly that the administration’s actions “comply fully with the Law of Armed Conflict,” the area of international law that is designed to prevent attacks on civilians.\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say the Law of Armed Conflict  would still apply to civilian drug traffickers , and the designation of a group as a foreign terrorist organization does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force. Several boats hit by the US have either been stationary or were turning around when they were attacked, CNN has reported, undermining the administration’s claim that they posed an imminent threat that could not be dealt with through interdiction and arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US defense officials have also expressed skepticism of the military campaign. The commander of US Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey,  offered to resign  during a tense meeting last month with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after he raised questions about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Holsey will leave his post in December, just one year into his tenure as the SOUTHCOM chief.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers specializing in international law within DoD’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Multiple current and former uniformed lawyers told CNN that the strikes do not appear lawful. Hegseth’s spokesperson has previously denied that any lawyers involved in the operations have dissented.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, another key US ally which has helped the US Coast Guard interdict suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean for nearly two decades, has also distanced itself from the US military strikes. The sources told CNN that Canada intends to continue its partnership with the Coast Guard, called Operation Caribbean. But the country has made clear to the US that it does not want its intelligence being used to help target boats for deadly strikes, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Canada’s defense  told Canadian press  last month that “it is important to note that Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbean, conducted in co-ordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct” from the US military strikes on suspected drug vessels.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/anthony-lennon-oklahoma-sex-offender-arrest","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-05:00","title":"After 13 Years, Oklahoma Sex Offender Anthony Lennon Arrested Under Alias 'Justin Phillips'","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In March 2012, a bloody crime scene at a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma, led investigators to suspect that Anthony Lennon, who had recently been charged with child sexual abuse material possession, had staged his own abduction and vanished.

vanished for 13 years after allegedly staging his own abduction. Here’s how officials found him \n       \n  By Chelsea Bailey, Lily Hautau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On a Monday in March 2012, detectives with the Moore, Oklahoma, police department were called to a bloody scene at a Super 8 Motel.\n \n\n   \n  They arrived before dawn to find a pool of blood at the bottom of a staircase and a path of bloody footprints heading toward an ice maker.\n \n\n   \n  Lying face up underneath the bottom stair rail – almost as if it had skittered away during a struggle – was a Super 8 employee’s name badge.\n \n\n   \n  Police said it belonged to a man named Anthony Lennon.\n \n\n   \n  And that, officers would later tell CNN, made the entire crime scene feel suspicious.\n \n\n   \n  Mere days before he disappeared, prosecutors had charged Lennon with eight counts of possession of child pornography.\n \n\n   \n  But now, he was missing.\n \n\n   \n  Had Lennon been attacked and abducted? Or, as law enforcement would come to suspect, did he stage his own kidnapping and vanish into the night?\n \n\n   \n  Uncovering the truth would lead Moore police detectives and the US Marshals Service on a manhunt that would span 13 years.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a cat and mouse game,” Moore Police Chief Todd Gibson told CNN. “When you commit crimes – when you victimize children – the full resources of (the law enforcement) community are going to come after you, and it’s never going to stop.”\n \n\n   \n    A crime scene ‘made for TV’\n \n\n   \n  Moore Police Detective Jason Landrum still remembers getting the 4 a.m. call to respond to the Super 8.\n \n\n   \n  When he arrived, he said officers were treating the crime as a robbery with a possible kidnapping. But as he walked through the scene, Landrum said something felt off.\n \n\n   \n  The placement of the evidence was suspicious, he said: The name tag was face up, so Lennon’s name was visible; the shoe print; the blood it tracked.\n \n\n   \n  Even the blood splatter itself stood out to the seasoned detectives investigating the scene.\n \n\n   \n  We “worked numerous crime scenes – and have since then – and it’s definitely not normal the way the blood was on the ground,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But subsequent testing, he added, confirmed the blood was indeed Lennon’s.\n \n\n   \n  The TV was still on in the motel’s office, Landrum said, and what appeared to be Lennon’s dinner – a sandwich and some potato chips – was sitting on the table. The register was also left open, he added, and papers had been scattered.\n \n\n   \n  All the signs pointed to a violent robbery and a possible abduction. But Landrum said the timing felt questionable.\n \n\n   \n  This was not the first time Lennon had been charged with possessing child pornography, more commonly described by law enforcement as child sexual abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  In 2010, Lennon pled guilty to five counts of aggravated possession of child sexual abuse material. He was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison, but a judge suspended that sentence and ordered the then 29-year-old to register as a sex offender as one of the conditions of his probation.\n \n\n   \n  By 2012, Oklahoma prosecutors felt they had amassed enough evidence that Lennon had violated his probation that they – once again – charged him with felony possession of child sex abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  But, according to officials, Lennon disappeared on the same day a $100,000 felony warrant for his arrest became active.\n \n\n   \n  “That was pretty coincidental to us,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  Coincidence or not, Lennon had indeed vanished – and he would remain missing for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It reads and sounds like a made-for-TV movie,” Gibson said. And it was only just beginning.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I hope he’s captured before I leave’\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of responding to the crime scene, Landrum said he called the US Marshals Service to request assistance on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I was afraid that he was going to try and flee the country,” Landrum said. “So, I contacted them to help me get word out to the borders.”\n \n\n   \n  But the days after Lennon’s disappearance dragged into months, and eventually, years.\n \n\n   \n  “It would have been really easy for us to just put this in the deactivated file … ” Gibson said. “But there was never a time that we stopped looking.”\n \n\n   \n  To balance their regular caseload, Landrum said Moore police detectives passed the baton to the US Marshals, who specialized in tracking criminals across state lines and solving cold cases.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Johnny Kuhlman, US Marshal for the Western District of Oklahoma, instructed his team to reopen the case and begin tracking new leads.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, he told CNN, marshals have filed numerous search warrants, conducted multiple interviews and logged hundreds of miles on road trips as they investigated Lennon’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been to several different states looking (for Lennon), following up on leads that turned out not to be true,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office added Lennon’s name to the state’s  10 Most Wanted list .\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he’s been haunted by the thought that Lennon could escape justice for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m getting closer to the end of my career, and this was one that stayed with me,” he said. “I always said that I hope he’s captured before I leave.”\n \n\n   \n  Then, two weeks ago, Landrum got the call he’d been waiting for.\n \n\n   \n    After more than a decade, officers finally make an arrest\n \n\n   \n  US Marshals had been following leads on a man named “Justin Phillips” who was living in Canton, New York – roughly 20 miles from the Canadian border.\n \n\n   \n  After months of investigating, marshals now believed “Phillips” was, in fact, Lennon, who’d been living in the state under an alias.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Moore police and the Marshals Service declined to share additional information about how they located Lennon, saying it could lead to additional charges.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of receiving the call from the US Marshals, Landrum said he’d booked a flight to join investigators working the case about an hour outside of Canton.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a small town,” Landrum said. “We knew our presence would be known fairly quickly with a large amount of us in that area, so we didn’t want to be anywhere close to him because we didn’t want to tip him off.”\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he joined surveillance teams that trailed Lennon as he left his home in Canton and spent the day at the local college where he was enrolled under the alias.\n \n\n   \n  SUNY-Canton confirmed to CNN Monday that an individual using the name Justin Phillips was a student at the school studying in the Engineering Science program.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators followed him to his neighborhood grocery store – and swooped in to make their arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “We still hadn’t 100% confirmed it was Anthony, even though I knew it was because I’ve been staring at his pictures for 13 years,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But he waited to call Gibson and inform the rest of the Moore Police Department until a fingerprint analysis conclusively revealed what he knew to be true:\n \n\n   \n  After 13 years on the run, law enforcement had finally arrested Anthony Lennon.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as he was driving back to his hotel room, Landrum said he called former detectives who’d worked on the Lennon case and had since retired to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “They haven’t forgot about this case,” he said. “And they were very, very excited.”\n \n\n   \n    He preyed on the ‘wrong community’\n \n\n   \n  But even with the fingerprint evidence, Landrum said, Lennon has continued to stand by the alias “Justin Phillips.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Lennon’s attorney, who confirmed she represents “a man alleged to be Anthony Lennon,” but stressed he is entitled to a presumption of innocence.\n \n\n   \n  She did not offer additional comment on the alleged probation violation and possession of child sexual abuse material charges that her client faces.\n \n\n   \n  Lennon holds a master’s degree in computer science, according to  the US Marshals , and was working toward a doctorate at the time of his disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said he believes Lennon was able to remain hidden for so long, in part, because of his extensive knowledge of computers.\n \n\n   \n  But he credited the tenacity and dedication of dozens of officers, detectives and US Marshals for the apprehension of the man who he said has eluded justice for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Lennon has been living in multiple parts of the country on the run from the law for over a decade,” Gibson said. “He is a person that decided to prey on children in the wrong community.”\n \n\n   \n  “You may think, for a while, that you’ve gotten away with it, and you may get relaxed, and as soon as you let your guard down, you’ll have strong men (and) strong women, knocking down your door to bring you to custody and bring you to justice.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

10:59 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fresh off of  pardoning a slew of allies  who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election, President Donald Trump is being strongly encouraged to intervene in the conviction of Tina Peters, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Peters, the former Republican clerk of Mesa, Colorado, was found guilty last year on state charges of participating in a scheme that hoped to prove Trump’s false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is serving her sentence at a women’s prison in Pueblo, Colorado. However, because she was found guilty on state charges, Trump cannot outright pardon her — that power belongs to Colorado’s Democratic governor. But that hasn’t stopped her allies from trying to get her out of prison.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people making the biggest push internally on her behalf is Ed Martin, who is serving as the pardon attorney at the Justice Department after he failed to get enough support to serve as the US attorney in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has continued to advocate for relief for Peters in recent weeks, several people familiar with the push told CNN, even though it is extremely unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a state case this way. The department has already  involved itself  in a long-shot federal case, known as a habeas petition, that Peters filed in March, and urged a federal judge to free her from state prison while she appeals her conviction. That matter is still pending, but a decision is expected this year.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has worked behind the scenes, over the objections of some of his colleagues, to find a way to grant relief for Peters. Responding Sunday to a post about the case on X, Martin wrote, “We are working on it!”\n \n\n   \n  During her sentencing hearing, Peters continued to argue that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Colorado state Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters that he was convinced she was not apologetic for her behavior and “would do it all over again if you could.”\n \n\n   \n  “You are no hero,” Barrett told her. “You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump lost in 2020, Peters got involved with other right-wing activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by allegedly breaching voting systems in Colorado,  Michigan ,  Georgia  and other states. They were acting based on false information, including from Trump’s own lawyers, that the 2020 results were rigged against him by machines belonging to Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  Peters was  indicted  by a Republican prosecutor and convicted by a jury in her ruby-red county of felonies tied to a data breach in Mesa related to the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly threatened “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters isn’t freed and has  called  her an “innocent political prisoner.”\n \n\n   \n  He has criticized Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats. Polis  has said  he won’t pardon Peters as part of any quid-pro-quo deal.\n \n\n   \n  From the La Vista Correctional Facility — a medium-security women’s prison in Pueblo — Peters has continued her advocacy through messages to her allies that they post on social media on her behalf. Last month, she directed her outrage at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “Where is everybody? I did what I was supposed to do” to “legally” expose supposed voter fraud in 2020, Peters wrote, adding, “The President has demanded my release four times… why is the DOJ defying Trump’s demands? Get off your a**es and get me out!”\n \n\n   \n  Peters has apparently latched onto an idea  recently floated  by those on the right that the Justice Department can move her from state prison into a more comfortable federal facility, because she needs protection as a witness in a potential federal probe into supposed 2020 voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, her attorneys have claimed they have critical new evidence about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  They have used her habeas petition to publicize new depositions that they took over the summer, supposedly of anonymous Venezuelan informants who said Dominion and Smartmatic machines can rig American elections — the same false claim that Trump, Peters and other election deniers have peddled since November 2020.\n \n\n   \n  But at a recent hearing, Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions weren’t admissible in the habeas case. He also observed that “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair” of the Justice Department in the months after DOJ officials participated an April hearing about its unorthodox intervention in Peters’ case.\n \n\n   \n  Martin confirmed Monday on Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast that the Justice Department wants to see Peters moved to a federal prison.\n \n\n   \n  “(Deputy Attorney General) Todd Blanche is the guy leading on this. We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said of the Trump administration’s contacts with Colorado officials. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say we want something, you change your tune.”\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Polis and Weiser, who is defending Peters’ convictions in state and federal courts, are “fully synced up” on how to resist Trump’s pressure campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doing her time,” the person said. “We don’t let threats affect us. We have a job to do and we’re going to do it. We are going to uphold the law.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, Polis’ office referred inquiries to the Colorado Department of Corrections. A department spokeswoman, Alondra Gonzalez, said there is currently no formal process underway to move Peters out of state custody and a transfer would require the approval of state prison officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Transferring an individual is an action typically initiated by the Colorado Department of Corrections, not an outside entity, and is based on our internal classification and threat-assessment protocol,” Gonzalez said in an email. “This process is most frequently reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs. The Department has not initiated this process for Tina Peters.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is no basis for the (federal) Bureau of Prisons to request a transfer of her custody. Any scheme to prevent her from being held accountable under Colorado law is outrageous,” Weiser said in a statement to CNN, adding that he would oppose any move.\n \n\n   \n  One of Peters’ lawyers, Patrick McSweeney, previously told CNN that Peters hasn’t had any direct contact with Trump from behind bars, but she has heard about his desire to get her out, and “she appreciates the president’s interest in her case, which is unusual for him to be involved in an individual matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/world/blast-islamabad-pakistan-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00.000-05:00","title":"At Least 12 Killed in Islamabad Suicide Attack – the Most Deadly Assault in the Pakistani Capital Since 2008","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A suicide bombing in Islamabad, Pakistan, killed 12 people and injured 20, marking the deadliest such attack in the city in nearly two decades.

CNN\n \n   \n  A suicide attack in Pakistan’s capital city of Islamabad on Tuesday killed 12 people and injured another 20 – marking the worst suicide bombing to rock the city in nearly two decades.\n \n\n   \n  Wreaths of gray smoke and orange flames curled over a car in the capital, in video of the aftermath, as Pakistani government ministers launched furious accusations over the alleged perpetrator of the deadly blast.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif foisted blame upon “Indian terrorist proxies” on Tuesday, adding that other recent militant attacks in the country were “being carried out from Afghan soil and backed by India.” The prime minister did not provide evidence to back the claims.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to India’s Ministry of External Affairs for comment on the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s president Asif Ali Zardari “strongly condemned the suicide blast” near the city’s High Court on Tuesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  It was the deadliest suicide attack in the Pakistani capital in close to two decades. The last major attack was in 2008 when a suicide attack by a militant Islamist group at the city’s Marriott hotel killed 54 people.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Tuesday, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a faction of the militant Pakistani Taliban (TTP), claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement seen by CNN. The JuA has been behind some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan in the past decade. However the TTP distanced itself from the attack, according to the group’s spokesman Mohammad Khurasani.\n \n\n   \n  Islamabad requires a high level of security to enter and exit the city with specific security zones throughout the capital. The explosion took place in the parking lot of the city’s busy judicial complex in a district full of high-ranking government offices.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities located CCTV footage showing a man loitering around the courts having attempted to enter the building – before carrying out the attack, according to Mohsin Naqvi, the Pakistani interior minister.\n \n\n   \n  “He was waiting, but when the police car approached that’s when he carried out the attack,” Naqvi told reporters on Tuesday. “Everyone who enters the court is checked by security and since he was unable to do so, he attacked the police car. We have all the CCTV footage.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I saw 40 people fall immediately’\n \n\n   \n  Manzar Abbas lay on a red and white hospital bed in Islamabad on Tuesday, his bloodied leg strapped with a thick bandage.\n \n\n   \n  The 32-year-old PhD student was near a police station close to the courts, when tens of residents immediately hit the ground following the blast. Then, in a split second, a security guard helped him get to hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was passing the police station close to the courts, I saw the police car pass me and I saw a man go towards it wearing his jacket,” Abbas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw about 40 people fall immediately,” he added. “I had been hit as well and bled a lot. But thank goodness I was saved.”\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan has faced a surge in Islamist violence since the Afghan Taliban swept Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif stated on X that Pakistan is in a “state of war” and that this attack should be taken as a “wake-up call” with regards to negotiations with neighboring Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “The rulers of Kabul can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but bringing this war all the way to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which—praise be to God—Pakistan has the full strength to respond,” the Pakistani defense minister added. (moved up)\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement expressing “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding both the attack in Islamabad as well as the attack on the cadet college in the country’s northwest. The statement from Afghanistan did not address the remarks of Pakistan’s defence minister.\n \n\n   \n  Both the embassies of China and the United States condemned the attack. The US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said in a statement that “the United States stands in solidarity with Pakistan in the struggle against terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between the Pakistani and Afghan militaries in October saw the worst violence between the two countries in years.\n \n\n   \n  An attempt to maintain a ceasefire fell apart when peace talks between the two neighbors failed in Istanbul last week following the failure to establish a long-term deal regarding hostile militant groups in Afghanistan that operate against Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The explosion came  less than a day after militants attacked a cadet college in northwestern Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/trump-bbc-sue-one-billion-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:49:00-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens $1 Billion Lawsuit Against BBC Over Documentary Edits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion, alleging that a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' falsely edited a statement he made on January 6, 2021, by splicing together two separate comments to imply a call for violent action.

election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK –  the Guardian praised  it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter  to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    How did the scandal originate?\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial slant, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  In his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Former BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns   about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n \n\n   \n  “They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his  Substack . “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\n \n\n   \n  Even when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor,  reported  Sunday   that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\n \n\n   \n    Have heads rolled?\n \n\n   \n  Yes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n \n\n   \n  Turness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite admitting mistakes, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    What is the BBC? Who owns it?\n \n\n   \n  The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter”, which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n \n\n   \n  It is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\n \n\n   \n  Since its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\n \n\n   \n  More profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n \n\n   \n    Is the BBC impartial?\n \n\n   \n  Nominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences.\n \n\n   \n  But the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  Farage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump threatened?\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\n \n\n   \n  The letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\n \n\n   \n    Could the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n \n\n   \n  It closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n \n\n   \n  Any payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the case being brought in Florida?\n \n\n   \n  In the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Still, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n \n\n   \n  “The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\n \n\n   \n    Has Trump threatened media outlets before?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay  $15 million  in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay  $16 million  to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n \n\n   \n  Stephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/weather/arctic-blast-chicago-snow-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:01:00.000Z","title":"Frozen iguanas fall from trees in Florida as record cold arrives","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A record cold snap extended as far south as Florida and into the southeastern U.S., with cities like Jacksonville, Savannah, and Miami recording daily temperature lows not seen in decades.

arrives \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:01 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Record cold temperatures have pushed as far south as Florida this morning as wind-whipped snow continues to pile up in the eastern Great Lakes from a brief bout of Arctic air gripping the eastern US.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen cities, reaching as far south as Fort Myers and Naples, Florida, toppled or tied daily record lows for November 11.\n \n\n   \n  This morning is the coldest so early in the fall since 1976 in Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, with both locations dropping to a shivering 28 degrees. Even Miami flirted with a record low, coming up one degree short at 49 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The cold is causing South Florida’s cold-blooded iguanas to “freeze,” or lose muscle control. They can sometimes fall out of trees as a result, which some Floridians saw Tuesday morning. The iguanas are not dead, but rather in a paralyzed state and can revive if temperatures warm up fast enough.\n \n\n   \n  Cold conditions farther north have kicked the lake-effect snow machine into gear across the Great Lakes for the first time this year. Snow will contribute to dangerous travel conditions on Tuesday in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and western New York.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest snow has come to an end in the western Great Lakes. Up to a foot of snow fell more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported early Monday along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  Chicago only picked up 1 to 3 inches of snow, which was accompanied by thunder and strong winds Sunday night into early Monday. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potentially historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are. That’s what happened Monday near Lake Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, over a foot of snow fell in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northwest Indiana from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Several inches of snow have also piled up in the Appalachians from West Virginia to the border between North Carolina and Tennessee since Monday. Knoxville, Tennessee, saw its earliest accumulating snow since 1996 on Monday,  according to the National Weather Service . Snowflakes have flown through the air as far south as the Atlanta metro area on Monday, and along the North Carolina coast in Wilmington on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The good news: The cold snap won’t stick around long. Temperatures across the central US rebound quickly on Tuesday, and most of the East warms up again on Wednesday and Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A few cities in the Midwest that just saw their first snowflakes of the season could flirt with daily record high temperatures on Saturday. That includes Dubuque, Iowa, and Rockford, Illinois, where thermometers are predicted to soar to near 70 degrees as the weekend begins.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/soccer-cristiano-ronaldo-2026-world-cup","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:03:00.000Z","title":"Cristiano Ronaldo Tells CNN the 2026 World Cup Will ‘Definitely’ Be His Last","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cristiano Ronaldo, the all-time leading goalscorer in international soccer with 143 goals and the first male player to score in five World Cups, has confirmed that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be his final international appearance.

him, saying they are politically motivated, and his party on Tuesday rejected the latest charges as “nonsense.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate move that also deepened an unprecedented year-long legal crackdown on Erdogan’s critics, the Istanbul prosecutor asked a higher court to consider shutting down Imamoglu’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP).\n \n\n   \n  Istanbul Chief Prosecutor Akin Gurlek announced the indictment at a press conference, saying it names 402 suspects, including the mayor, and accuses them of forming a criminal organization, bribery, fraud and bid-rigging.\n \n\n   \n  Gurlek said the network caused 160 billion lira ($3.8 billion) in losses to the Turkish state over a 10-year period.\n \n\n   \n  The more than 4,000-page indictment includes an organization chart that portrays Imamoglu as the founder and head of the criminal group.\n \n\n   \n  It cites findings by the Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK), expert analysis and

\n  What happens when the unstoppable force meets an immovable object?\n \n\n   \n  Both are equally powerful, deemed indestructible and when they do meet, the laws of physics are pushed to their limits.\n \n\n   \n  For two years now, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have been those dominant entities in tennis, redefining the boundaries of the game, carving up the Grand Slams between them and rewriting the record books.\n \n\n   \n  It’s apt then that in a year of fine margins, thrilling encounters and breathtaking athleticism, the gripping “Sincaraz” narrative boils down to one final chapter.\n \n\n   \n  The setting? Turin. The tournament? Nitto ATP Finals. The prize? To be crowned the year-end world number one.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n \n\n   \n    Dominant duo\n \n\n   \n  Just as in 2024, the seemingly inseparable duo have swept all four Grand Slam titles in 2025 with each encounter proving more tantalising than the last.\n \n\n   \n  After Sinner defended his Australian Open title in January – his final tournament before serving a suspension for failing two doping tests – what followed was a trilogy of finals of epic proportions.\n \n\n   \n  A French Open for the ages saw Alcaraz prevail, a month later the Italian showed remarkable resilience to bounce back and claim his maiden Wimbledon crown before the Spaniard produced a stunning display to secure a second US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Ten majors so far between them – six to Alcaraz; four to Sinner – leaving the rest of the tour reeling by a considerable margin.\n \n\n   \n  Still only 22 and 24, respectively, and scarily with still room to improve, the rivalry is set to endure.\n \n\n   \n  But is that how they see it?\n \n\n   \n  “I think the word rivalry takes on the professional part, in the tennis side,” Alcaraz told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to find the weaknesses from each other on court but then when we shake hands and we are off the court, we’re totally different.\n \n\n   \n  “We sometimes forgot about the rivalry we were getting on tour and we became persons and that’s what it means, the word rivalry.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I’m seeing him more than my mom’\n \n\n   \n  That mutual humility, respect and admiration on and off the court has been ever present since their first meeting as teenagers in Alcaraz’s professional debut in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  While their on-court showdowns – characterized by breathtaking rallies and heavy hitting – have left audiences on the edge of their seats, off-court their ever-growing friendship has equally captivated fans around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The duo took to the court for a practice session last week ahead of the main draw, which drew thousands of viewers to the tournament’s live stream.\n \n\n   \n  A post-practice selfie shortly followed, racking up plenty of social media attention.\n \n\n   \n  “When you practice together, see each other in the locker then it’s natural that you get to know each other better and better,” Sinner said of their burgeoning friendship.\n \n\n   \n  “You talk about family and life in general, sharing also some personal stuff.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s changed. It just has become better because we know each other better.”\n \n\n   \n  “I said in the summer, I’m seeing him more than, than my mom actually. … I never get tired of seeing him,” Alcaraz jokes.\n \n\n   \n    Race to the top\n \n\n   \n  For this week, at least, that friendship will have to take a back seat as the two vie for the both the season-ending title and honor of finishing 2025 as the tour’s top-ranked player.\n \n\n   \n  Sinner may have taken the bragging rights last year – claiming both in a sensational 2024 – but this time around it’s advantage Alcaraz.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard – who ended the year top of the tree in 2022 – currently holds a slender lead over his rival in the rankings.\n \n\n   \n  He knows that reaching the final with at least one round-robin win or sweeping his round-robin matches will guarantee that award for a second time.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard is firmly on course for that quest, having defeated Australia’s Alex de Minaur on Sunday in his opening match of the tournament.\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Turin would bring with it differing sets of emotions for the two.\n \n\n   \n  For Alcaraz, a first Nitto ATP Finals trophy would cap off what he deems to be his best year to date, having won eight titles this season alone.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard began that quest on Sunday with victory over Australia’s Alex de Minaur in their round-robin clash.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t hide the results. It’s my best year so far without a doubt in terms of level, in terms of consistency” he acknowledges.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw myself grow up a lot since the last year to understand some situations, to realize what I have to do to get to know myself even more and what I need off the court.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is a general situation on and off the court which made this year my best.”\n \n\n   \n    Separated by a hair’s breadth\n \n\n   \n  Sinner meanwhile goes into Turin on a scintillating indoor winning streak having recently brushed aside Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime to win his maiden Paris Masters title.\n \n\n   \n  Whilst his powerful, pinpoint ball placement and supremacy on indoor courts makes him a strong favourite to reclaim his respective crowns, the Italian is aware of the threat posed by his nearest challenger and the expectation to deliver again in front of his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “There is for sure this extra motivation and some pressure so it’s a privilege to be in this position,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something great to finish the year with a win and with an incredible big trophy but you also don’t have to forget how the season went and everything we both have done for the two years, and it has been again a great year.”\n \n\n   \n  So where, if anywhere, will an advantage be gained?\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, the secret weapon, could be Alcaraz’s latest bold statement: A dashing black and white haircut.\n \n\n   \n  Looking the part of a comic book hero capable of backing it up with his superhuman skills, the Spaniard hair is in its third incarnation since his initial buzzcut caused a stir at the US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, it’s evolved into platinum blonde and now colors – as Sinner remarked – aptly resembling Turin’s powerhouse football team, Juventus.\n \n\n   \n  “My team are scared about it next year,” the Spaniard says smiling.\n \n\n   \n  “This year has been really good with the changes.\n \n\n   \n  “If something works, why should I change it?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"09:31:00-05:00","title":"India on edge after deadly car explosion in capital region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car explosion occurred near India’s iconic Red Fort in Delhi on November 11, 2025, killing at least 10 people and injuring over 30 others.

The area, a major tourist hub known for its crowded bazaars and street vendors, was immediately thrown into chaos.\n \n\n   \n  The incident, a rare occurrence for the sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people, unleashed a scene of devastation in the heart of Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the aftermath showed thick, orange flames billowing into the pitch-black sky, vehicles twisted and charred from the blast and victims strewn across the street.\n \n\n   \n  The cause of the blast is not yet known, and the Indian government has yet to blame any specific group. Comments from top government officials on Tuesday have begun to suggest the act was a deliberate one.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from Bhutan, where he is on a visit, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “horrific incident” in Delhi “has deeply saddened everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy,” he said in Hindi, before breaking out into English: “All those responsible will be brought to justice.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s defense minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the “findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The National Investigation Agency (NIA), India’s principal counter-terrorism law enforcement agency, is now handling the case.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Before the explosion, a “slow-moving” vehicle “came to a stop” near a red light around 6:42 p.m. local time, Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “An explosion occurred in that vehicle.

Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard a big sound.

The US embassy in New Delhi is advising Americans to avoid the surrounding area as well as large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  The states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which neighbors Delhi, has also been put on high alert, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  Security arrangements “of important establishments, religious sites, crowded places, and other sensitive points” will be reviewed, Uttar Pradesh police  wrote  on X. The state, India’s most populous, is home to the Taj Mahal and other major tourist attractions.\n \n\n   \n  Haryana’s head of police, OP Singh, urged residents to “remain calm” and report any “suspicious person or unclaimed object” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The northwestern state of Rajasthan is also on high alert, its police department  said  on X.\n \n\n   \n  In the financial capital of Mumbai, train stations have been put on high alert, Reuters reported, citing authorities.\n \n\n   \n    Historic monument\n \n\n   \n  The Red Fort stands as one of India’s most significant historical landmarks.\n \n\n   \n  Originally built by Emperor Shah Jahan as the palace-fort of his capital, it served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.

\n        7:38 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s the Trump ship that never sails.\n \n\n   \n  The president was back at it on Monday, promising an imminent solution to America’s growing health care crisis — on which he has repeatedly failed to deliver in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell you, we’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time, where the people get the money,” President Donald Trump said, referring specifically to Americans thrown into crisis by  expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies . “We’re talking about trillions and trillions of dollars, where the people get the money,” he added, without giving details about a vague idea to  send cash to affected policyholders  to replace subsidies while bypassing insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s off-the-cuff answer was a typical example of the waffle he sometimes conjures to escape a jam in a photo-op. But he could not disguise the downside of his “win” in the government shutdown, which looks set to end after Democrats failed to secure their top demand: the extension of  those enhanced Obamacare subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Republicans once again own the issue of health care, with millions of citizens —  not just those on ACA plans  — afflicted by rising premiums and high deductibles against the backdrop of a  wider cost-of-living crisis . And just as in his first term, Trump lacks a comprehensive, detailed plan to bring relief to citizens who lack health care, who can’t afford the plans they have or who know that the loss of a job could leave them without any coverage at all.\n \n\n   \n  If the GOP cannot fix the immediate issue of the subsidies — and convince voters they have a serious solution to this and other affordability questions — their  2026 midterm election hopes  could take a dive.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s fogginess on health care is nothing new. Repeated unfulfilled promises to act took their place alongside his much-lampooned “ infrastructure weeks ” as punch lines in his first term. Trump’s pledges to replace Obamacare shimmered with hyperbole but delivered nothing, and the 2010 law survives despite multiple Republican efforts to destroy it.\n \n\n   \n  During the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific.” At rallies, he promised Americans new health care that would cost less but be far better. If that sounds impossible, it’s probably because it is.\n \n\n   \n  Early in his first term, Trump promised that change was on the way. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!”  he wrote  on the website formerly known as Twitter in March 2017. The GOP failure to repeal Obamacare, partly because it couldn’t come up with an alternative, didn’t stop Trump’s sunny predictions. “The Republican Party will be soon be known as theparty of health care,”  the president declared  in March 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Second term, same as the first. In his debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Trump was mocked for  saying he had  “concepts of a plan” to make health care “better and less expensive.” More than a year later — and despite some significant efforts by Trump to bring down the cost of some prescription drugs — Americans are still waiting for his wider solutions.\n \n\n   \n    Republican divisions boil over health care\n \n\n   \n  The fight over health care was not just at the center of the government shutdown battle with Democrats. It’s tearing at Republican Party unity. It’s even estranged Trump and one of his most outspoken supporters,  Marjorie Taylor Greene . The Georgia representative broke ranks early in the shutdown to highlight  ACA insurance premiums  for her family that she said would double in price due to expiring subsidies. While no fan of the ACA, she lashed out at her own party. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene wrote on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s persistent criticism is a warning sign for House Speaker Mike Johnson after he called back the House to vote on the Senate plan to reopen the government this week. It might explain why he was so keen to keep the chamber dark during a shutdown that set internal GOP dissent simmering. Greene further distanced herself from Trump on Monday, saying on X that he should spend less time meeting foreign leaders and instead hold “nonstop” meetings on domestic policy.\n \n\n   \n  The president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think.” Greene then told CNN, “I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!”\n \n\n   \n  Greene might now be regarded as a MAGA heretic by some in Trump’s orbit. But her comments on health care raise another possibility — that she’s far more in tune with the economic insecurity felt by regular Americans than a billionaire president and his wealthy Cabinet.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not alone. During the shutdown, a group of endangered House Republicans  wrote to Johnson  to urge him to address expiring enhanced ACA subsidies when the government reopens. “While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republican leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies as part of the deal with moderate Democrats to reopen the government. Chances of a Democrat-written bill passing are slim. But the vote will put GOP senators on the record and on a political spot.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson hasn’t pledged to hold a similar vote — one reason why progressive Democrats are angry about centrist Senate Democrats’ compromise to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” Monday that he’d always been willing to talk about rising health care costs, but that Democrats had squandered weeks of valuable time by triggering the shutdown last month. He promised debate on a plan to get to the “root cause” of the health care issue. But that is unlikely to help ACA policyholders forced to decide now whether to give up health plans they can’t afford or pay punitively rising premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson could not tell Tapper whether there’d be a vote on this issue soon. “I’m not committing to it or not committing to it. What I’m saying is that we do a deliberative process. It’s the way this always works and we have to have time to do that,” the speaker said. But the tiny GOP majority gives little cause for optimism that an issue as complex and divisive as health care reform is something the fractious GOP and an absent president could handle.\n \n\n   \n  One tangible gain for Democrats in the shutdown drama was their highlighting of the ACA issue and attacks on Republicans for failing to fix health care. In  an NBC News poll  taken last month during the shutdown, 10% of respondents cited the cost of health care premiums as the single top issue deciding their vote for Congress next year. And 49% of respondents said Democrats would do a better job dealing with health care compared with 26% who thought the same of Republicans\n \n\n   \n   Many Democrats are furious  that their moderate Senate colleagues made a deal with Republicans to reopen the government because they see it as a betrayal of Americans on the health care issue. But Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who helped broker the deal and joined seven others in the Democratic caucus to back it, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan the deal would show whether Republicans were serious.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, because of the shutdown fight, we’ve had a number of Republicans who have figured out that this is an issue for them,” the New Hampshire Democrat said. “So, now we’ll see. We’ll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n  Viewing Democratic tactics, a cynic might wonder whether the party, which failed to make the enhanced Obamacare credits permanent during the Biden administration, laid a trap for Republicans on an issue their rivals always failed to solve, especially under Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But some Republicans don’t buy the idea that the party is vulnerable on health care, arguing that Democrats would be blamed for higher costs. GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt told CNN that “I think people know that Democrats own Obamacare, and it’s been a disaster.”\n \n\n   \n    How Trump has tried to lower some health care costs\n \n\n   \n  Republicans argue that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” domestic policy law had already made significant steps to make health care more affordable by loosening the power of insurance companies and by restoring choice and control, partly by  handing more responsibility to the states . But multiple health care analysts and groups say that the bill’s  cuts to Medicaid funding  could leave millions vulnerable to losing coverage and threaten many rural hospitals with closure.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has several initiatives designed to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for Americans. It plans to launch  TrumpRx , a direct-to-consumer website, early next year. Last week, the president unveiled a plan to make  certain obesity drugs  available for as little as $149 in an arrangement that gives pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk tariff breaks. If this plan works, it could be lifesaving for many patients who can’t get the drugs through their insurers and can’t afford out-of-pocket prices to buy them.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative reflects Trump’s willingness to use government power to intervene in markets, which has also been seen in other sectors, and which flies in the face of conservative orthodoxy. A plan he recently floated to send money directly to ACA policyholders, instead of offering subsidies, also seems to spring from a similar motivation to shake up the industry.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the idea is fraught with uncertainties, including whether such payments would cover the shortfall of all the subsidies. Another question is whether it would simply make up the shortfall in subsidies to pay for premiums. Or would it be a separate payment that patients could use to pay for the costs of treatment directly?\n \n\n   \n  In the latter case of a payment that bypasses insurance firms, recipients might be exposed to massive costs if they get an adverse diagnosis. Trump told Fox News on Monday evening that he didn’t want money to go to insurance companies but that it would go into a separate account so people could negotiate their own, better health insurance.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to feel like entrepreneurs,” Trump said. But he gave no details of how such a complex scheme could help policyholders now, and did not explain how it would lower costs.\n \n\n   \n  And spiking health costs don’t only afflict ACA policyholders. If the government sent cash to certain Americans, how would that be fair to other taxpayers? And wouldn’t state-financed payments for health care go against everything the GOP believes?\n \n\n   \n  Such thorny questions, and the president’s past failures to deliver on health care, explain the Republican Party’s new but familiar political nightmare on an issue that causes anxiety for tens of millions of voters.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/sydney-sweeney-female-boxing-movies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-05:00","title":"Sydney Sweeney’s boxing movie was a bomb.

Why? Because we don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact.”\n \n\n   \n  The film tells the story of Christy Martin, a pioneering American boxer, who survived a murder attempt by her trainer-spouse. (Martin is  now married  to a  former competitor , Lisa Holewyne.)\n \n\n   \n  Sweeney is an A-list star but this year she’s been featured in more  controversy-centered headlines  about her advertising work than she has been in  successful  film and TV projects. That attention she’s gotten has not immediately resulted in people in seats this year.\n \n\n   \n  What happened here? The truth about boxing films in general and boxing films starring women may have some answers.\n \n\n   \n  Last year’s “The Fire Inside” starred Ryan Destiny. She played female boxer Claressa “T-Rex” Shields, who competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and has held multiple championships across various weight classes.\n \n\n   \n  It got positive reviews, but only earned $1.96 million in its opening weekend, picking up to $8 million during its entire domestic run, according to Box Office Mojo.\n \n\n   \n  “Against the Ropes,” a 2004 fictionalized version of the life of boxing manager Jackie Kallen, starring Meg Ryan, garnered negative reviews and slim big box office receipts to match.\n \n\n   \n  That played a role in Ryan stepping out of the field for a bit. During  a 2019 interview with the New York Times  Ryan was asked if “Against the Ropes” and another film, “In the Cut,” “had been better received by critics or audiences” would she have still have taken a break from her Hollywood career, as she did.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the feeling with Hollywood was mutual,” Ryan said at the time. “I felt done when they felt done, probably.”\n \n\n   \n  What about boxing movies about men? “Hands of Stone,” the Robert De Niro film about Roberto Durán, opened widely in 2016 and  seems to  have tracked very similarly to “Christy,” with a weak opening weekend and a slow follow.\n \n\n   \n  The Miles Teller biopic of Vinny Pazienza, “Bleed for This,”  similarly  failed to fill theaters. “Phantom Punch,” the 2009 Sonny Liston biopic starring Ving Rhames, performed so poorly it has been almost erased from  the permanent record. \n \n\n   \n  It might feel like audiences,  despite their love  of “Raging Bull” and the “Rocky” franchise, just don’t love biographical boxing movies about real people that much.\n \n\n   \n  Except, every once in a while, one film proves an exception to the rule. “The Fighter,” David O. Russell’s fictionalized biography of boxer Micky Ward, was a rare worldwide smash in 2010. Ron Howard’s 2005 “Cinderella Man,” about James J. Braddock and starring Russell Crowe, was also a rare critical and commercial success.\n \n\n   \n  The best-known women’s boxing films aren’t biopics.\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Rodriguez made her movie acting debut in “Girlfight,” a fictional independent film. She played a hot-tempered teen who decides to channel her anger into boxing. The very inexpensive film didn’t pull in a ton of money, but it did launch Rodriguez’s movie career, which has included the billion-dollar “Fast & Furious” franchise. It also made a name for Karyn Kusama, who later directed “Jennifer’s Body” and is an executive producer of “Yellowjackets.”\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s the biggest of them all: the fictional 2004 film “Million Dollar Baby.” Not only did it find commercial success, it met wide critical acclaim. It won best picture at the Academy Awards and stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won best actress and best supporting actor, respectively. Clint Eastwood, who pushed for the film to be made and costarred as well, also won a best director Oscar.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/fifty-year-mortgage","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump just floated a 50-year mortgage.

Is that a good idea? \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Most first-time homebuyers in the United States take out 30-year mortgages. Under a new proposal from the Trump administration, they may soon have an even longer loan option.\n \n\n   \n  This week, President Donald Trump introduced a new idea to tackle home affordability: a 50-year mortgage loan. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s   proposal is light on details, administration officials say a 50-year mortgage would lower monthly payments, helping more Americans currently priced out of the market.\n \n\n   \n  But many housing experts warn the plan could backfire, raising the cost of homeownership by stretching out payments, adding more interest over time and driving up home prices.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not a good idea,” said Richard Green, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. “The monthly payment savings would be really small. At the same time, you’re putting people at risk, because it takes a really long time for them to start paying down their loan.”\n \n\n   \n    Total interest payments could skyrocket\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year mortgage loan traces its roots back to the Great Depression. Over the last century, it has become the dominant way to purchase a house in the United States. Many Americans prefer   a longer loan period because payments are lower than those of, say, a 15-year mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  A 50-year mortgage could have even lower payments.\n \n\n   \n  “What it does is, it reduces the monthly payment quite a bit for a typical home for middle America by a few hundred dollars a month,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said in a Monday interview on Fox. “We need to help people get back into homes.”\n \n\n   \n  But homeowners would end up paying far more in interest over time, Green said.\n \n\n   \n  Take a $450,000 home, for example. With a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 6.25% interest rate, the monthly payment would be about $2,771. Over the life of that loan, the homeowner would pay more than $547,000 in interest.\n \n\n   \n  With a 50-year loan at the same rate, the monthly payment would fall to around $2,452 – but total interest would balloon to about $1.02 million, or 87% more than on the 30-year loan.\n \n\n   \n  “With a 50-year loan, you’re paying a teeny, tiny amount to your principal loan early on, so your interest payments are not going down very much,” Green said. “It depends on what the interest rate is, but it could be like 30 or 40 years before you’ve even paid half your mortgage (principal) under those circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  The best way to improve housing affordability is  to build more homes  where people want to live, Green said. A cheaper home loan might boost demand, but without adding new supply, it could actually push prices higher.\n \n\n   \n    Mortgage rates may differ for 50-year loans\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether a 50-year mortgage would carry the same interest rates as a 30-year loan.\n \n\n   \n  “Until you figure out who the buyer is for that mortgage and how they’re going to model out the borrower behavior, it’s really tough to say anything more than the rate will probably be a little bit higher than the 30-year,” said Jeff DerGurahian, chief investment officer at loanDepot, a mortgage lender.\n \n\n   \n  A 50-year loan carries a higher risk of default because it stretches so long. Lenders may charge higher interest rates as a result. And since it would take borrowers much longer to build equity, a drop in housing prices could leave more homeowners owing more than their properties are worth.   \n \n\n   \n  There’s also a legal question surrounding 50-year mortgages. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, passed after the 2008 housing crisis, loan terms cannot exceed 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  “You would need a lot of legislation to bring this about,” Green said of the 50-year mortgage proposal.\n \n\n   \n  When asked, the White House did not provide details about any legislative plans.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a White House official said: “President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans. Any official policy changes will be announced by the White House.”\n \n\n   \n    A foot in the door to homeownership?\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the average age of first-time homebuyers in America climbed to a record high of 40 years old, according to  data  released last week by the National Association of Realtors. A combination of sky-high home prices and mortgage rates stuck between 6% and 7% have locked many young Americans out of homeownership.\n \n\n   \n  With a 50-year loan, some of those first-time buyers could be paying off their home loans well into their 90s.\n \n\n   \n  But Phil Crescenzo, a vice president at Nation One Mortgage Corporation, said the industry has been overly negative on the 50-year mortgage proposal.\n \n\n   \n  While homeowners would build equity more slowly than with a shorter loan, Crescenzo noted that, in some cases, a 50-year mortgage could still be better than renting and never accumulating any home equity at all.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like somebody would have to stay in that loan forever. It’s a starting point,” Crescenzo said, pointing out that homeowners always have the option to refinance their loans.\n \n\n   \n  “If I had the option where I’m renting the home or I can get a 50-year mortgage and I’m not going to gain much equity for a couple of years, I would still take that deal versus renting,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/food/chipotle-sweetgreen-cava-earnings-problems-slop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00+00:00","title":"Has the cash-strapped American worker fallen out of love with slop?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The fast-casual restaurant industry, particularly chains like Cava, Chipotle, and Sweetgreen that serve warm bowls, is facing a significant downturn as younger consumers aged 25 to 35 cut back on spending due to economic pressures such as rising living costs, student loan repayments, and low consumer sentiment.

\n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Purveyors of the so-called “slop bowl” just had another messy quarter.\n \n\n   \n  What was once the lowly desk salad has since expanded to a mish-mosh of options in a bowl, ranging from proteins like carne asada and lamb meatballs to toppings like tzatziki or  red chimichurri , and has become a staple of the American worker’s diet.\n \n\n   \n  But the big three slop slingers — Cava, Chipotle and Sweetgreen — all reported similar problems in their recent earnings: Younger customers, particularly those aged between 25 to 35, are pinching pennies and choosing to forgo the $15 (or $20) warm bowls.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, they are packing their lunches or gravitating toward fast food chains  offering deep discounts , thus hurting the trio’s bottom lines.\n \n\n   \n  The fast-casual restaurants face several issues, in particular that the “softer wage and spending growth” that had been affecting lower-income consumers “seems to be creeping up into the middle income and young professional consumer,” according to Brian Vaccaro, restaurant analyst at Raymond James.\n \n\n   \n  Anxiety around political issues, such as the government shutdown, as well as increased competition from value meals at fast food rivals, are also affecting their customer bases, Vaccaro said.\n \n\n   \n    Fast casual has become ‘too expensive’\n \n\n   \n  Cava, which serves customizable Mediterranean-style bowls, is one chain that’s feeling the effects. The stock, which surged 162% in 2024, has fallen nearly 60% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “We know our Gen Z consumers are certainly facing headwinds this year that may not have existed last year,” Cava CEO Brett Schulman told CNN, citing   the resumption of student loan repayments, record-low  consumer sentiment  levels and Gen Z unemployment that’s  “double the national rate.” \n \n\n   \n  Last week, Cava ( CAVA ) revealed that its traffic was flat for the second consecutive quarter, so it cut its same-store sales outlook to 3% - 4% (from 4% - 6%) for the rest of 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “When you look at the (fast-casual) industry since 2019, while sales have grown, transactions are actually down 7%,” he said. “The industry has gotten too expensive for consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, some of those once reliable customers are now buying more groceries to save money, said R.J. Hottovy, a restaurant analyst at data analytics firm Placer.ai.\n \n\n   \n  “These consumers are simultaneously shifting visits to grocery chains like Trader Joe’s and other alternative food retailers as they seek more affordable options,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That was pointed out    during Chipotle’s earnings report,   which  showed miserable results  at the end of October. The chain cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter, and shares are down 50% this year.\n \n\n   \n  CEO Scott Boatwright said  younger consumers , particularly those aged 25 to 35   who make up a quarter of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home,” he told analysts during Chipotle’s latest earnings call. “It is one of our core consumer cohorts. They feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  He argues that Chipotle ( CMG ) is still more affordable than its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The fast-casual sector is just out of favor and has been deemed unaffordable and we are lumped into that,” he said, bristling at criticism that Chipotle has  become  too expensive . “But I will still tell you, we are still at 20% to 30% discount to our fast-casual peers in the sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaccaro agrees that Chipotle’s value proposition “remains very strong with an entry-level price point of less than $10 in most markets (excluding higher-cost markets   like New York).” But he thinks some consumers might have forgotten, since the chain typically avoids advertising around its prices.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Chipotle is faring better than Sweetgreen, the once high-flying salad and warm bowl chain whose stock finished nearly 200% higher in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Shares have, however, nosedived 83% this year, and the company’s market cap is hovering at $680 million — a steep fall from its nearly $5 billion valuation when it went  public in 2021 .\n \n\n   \n  Sweetgreen ( SG ) revealed in its earnings   last   Thursday that same-store sales slid 9.5% and visits fell nearly 12%. That caps off a tough year for the brand, which ended a  salad subscription program  and axed selling fries after just five months.\n \n\n   \n  “The 25 to 35 (year old) consumer is the most under pressure, and they make up about 30% of our consumer base,” said Sweetgreen CFO Jamie McConnell on a call with analysts, adding that their spending declined about 15%.\n \n\n   \n  To lure back value-conscious customers, Sweetgreen this week will begin promoting that it has boosted protein portions by 25%.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the current problems, analysts say the chains are well positioned for the future. That’s because there will always be consumer appetite for “high quality, fresh ingredients at reasonable price points,” said Vaccaro.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/military-strikes-platforms-caribbean-pacific","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"What the US military is using to strike alleged drug boats","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military has launched a significant campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, using advanced platforms such as MQ-9 Reaper drones, AC-130J gunships, and F-35 fighter jets.

Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has undertaken a  campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats  in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea using a variety of drones, gunships, and fighter jets, according to people familiar with the assets being deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes have been carried out using MQ-9 Reaper drones, the sources said, which are remotely piloted aircraft used by the military and are typically armed with Hellfire missiles. Other strikes have been conducted by manned aircraft, including AC-130J gunships and fighter jets, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  To date the Pentagon has not publicly acknowledged what aircraft or hardware the military is using to conduct the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Since early September, the US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has concentrated many of its assets in Puerto Rico, including the MQ-9 drones, F-35 fighter jets, and at least one AC-130J gunship. All have limited ranges and are likely being used for the strikes in the Caribbean. The gunship was  spotted  on October 9 armed with precision-guided missiles for striking ground targets, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, an  AC-130J  gunship operated by the US Air Force surfaced in El Salvador, at US Cooperative Security Location (CSL) Comalapa, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The facilities in both Puerto Rico and El Savador are seeing highly unusual US military activity.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004,  is now back up and running , according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base.\n \n\n   \n  And while the US facility at El Salvador International Airport has regularly hosted surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft since it was set up in 2000, the outpost had until recently been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the United States Southern Command.\n \n\n   \n  The position of the facility near El Salvador’s coast makes it uniquely positioned to play a role in the US campaign in the Pacific Ocean. Previously, most potential smuggling vessels transiting the Pacific would have been too far from the types of attack aircraft sources said have been used for the campaign, all of which have limited range and were based either in Puerto Rico or the continental US.\n \n\n   \n  “Operating out of Comalapa provides more options and permits a much wider swath of the Pacific Ocean — through which much of the cocaine trafficked toward the United States passes — to be surveilled and defended,” explained Dr. Ryan Berg, the director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Before the US began striking alleged drug boats in September, CSL Comalapa played a different role in fighting narcotics trafficking, historically hosting maritime surveillance aircraft, including a Navy P-8A and P-3 Orion operated by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n \n\n   \n  The MQ-9 Reapers, at least seven of which are based in Puerto Rico, according to photos captured in Aguadilla, are predominantly used to strike targets with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, a weapon that was originally designed to destroy enemy tanks but that has become a workhorse for the military as part of drone operations against a range of ground targets.\n \n\n   \n  The AC-130J can carry the Hellfire but it is primarily armed with large guns. The AC-130J seen in photographs obtained by CNN in El Salvador had two cannons—including a 105mm howitzer— visible on the left side of the gunship.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon shifted its strategy in recent weeks to more frequently striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN has reported. The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia to Mexico and eventually to the US, rather than Venezuela, the origin for some of the boats targeted in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers have been seeking answers from the Pentagon about how much the counternarcotics campaign is costing taxpayers, but officials briefing Congress in recent weeks have not provided an overall dollar amount, sources said. Instead, administration officials have acknowledged that each strike typically costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, between the cost per flight hour of the platform and the cost of the munition used.\n \n\n   \n  One hellfire missile, for example, typically costs about $150,000, and reaper drones cost around $3,500 per hour to fly. An F-35 costs around $40,000 per hour to fly. The cost per flight hour of an AC-130J gunship is not public but its predecessor, the AC-130U, which was phased out in 2019, cost over $40,000 per hour to fly.\n \n\n   \n  The targeting for the strikes is being done via a joint US Southern Command/Special Operations Command targeting cell, with input from the intelligence community, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But  questions have been raised  about whether everyone the US has killed is truly a member of, or even affiliated with, one of the dozens of drug cartels the US has designated as terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  In  several briefings  to Congress, including one last week, administration officials have acknowledged that they do not necessarily know the identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it. Strikes are instead conducted based on intelligence that the vessels are linked to a specific cartel or criminal organization, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, additional military assets are steaming toward the Caribbean, including the Ford Carrier Strike Group. A significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally have been located in  US Southern Command  since last month.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials have told Congress that the Ford is moving there to support counternarcotic operations and conduct intelligence gathering, two of the sources said, but its deployment to the region is raising questions about whether President Donald Trump could soon launch strikes against Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In a briefing last month, two senior US Special Operations officers could not explain why the administration needed so many powerful military assets stationed in the Caribbean just to blow up small boats, a source familiar with the closed-door session on Capitol Hill said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/redistricting-utah-judge-democrat-leaning-district-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:40:00-05:00","title":"Judge adopts Utah congressional map that creates a Democrat-leaning district for 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Utah judge, Dianna Gibson, rejected a Republican-drawn congressional map that would have maintained all four Republican-held districts, finding it violated voter-established anti-gerrymandering standards.

hold all four of Utah’s House seats and had advanced a map poised to protect them.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Dianna Gibson ruled just before a midnight deadline that the Legislature’s new map “unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.”\n \n\n   \n  She had ordered lawmakers to draw a map that complies with standards established by voters to ensure districts don’t deliberately favor a party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\n \n\n   \n  If they failed, Gibson warned she may consider other maps submitted by plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led her to throw out Utah’s existing map.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson ultimately selected a map drawn by plaintiffs, the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government. It keeps Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four districts, as was the case previously.\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s ruling throws a curveball for Republicans in a state where they expected a clean sweep as they’re working to add winnable seats elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  Nationally, Democrats need to net three US House seats next year to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which is trying to buck a historic pattern of the president’s party losing seats in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  The newly approved map gives Democrats a much stronger chance to flip a seat in a state that has not had a Democrat in Congress since early 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a win for every Utahn,” said state House and Senate Democrats in a joint statement. “We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, Gibson struck down the Utah congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented anti-gerrymandering standards passed by voters.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling thrust Utah into a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump urged other Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic states are considering new maps of their own, with California voters approving a map last week that gives Democrats a shot at winning five more seats. Republicans are still ahead in the redistricting fight.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting typically occurs once a decade after a census. There are no federal restrictions to redrawing districts mid-decade, but some states — more led by Democrats than Republicans — set their own limitations.\n \n\n   \n  The Utah ruling gives an unexpected boost to Democrats, who have fewer opportunities to gain seats through redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  If Gibson had instead approved the map drawn by lawmakers, all four districts would still lean Republican but two would have become slightly competitive for Democrats. Their proposal gambled on Republicans’ ability to protect all four seats under much slimmer margins rather than create a single-left leaning district.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling came minutes before midnight on the day the state’s top election official said was the latest possible date to enact a new congressional map so county clerks would have enough time to prepare for candidate filings for the 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have argued Gibson does not have legal authority to enact a map that wasn’t approved by the Legislature. State Rep. Matt MacPherson called the ruling a “gross abuse of power” and said he has opened a bill to pursue impeachment against Gibson.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said in her ruling she has an obligation to ensure a lawful map is in place by the deadline.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/climate/cop30-explainer-belem-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:46:00-11:11","title":"What is COP30 and why does it matter?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"COP30, the 30th United Nations climate conference, is underway in Belém, Brazil, where over 190 countries are negotiating key climate policies to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

\nUpdated: \n        5:46 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  planet’s biggest climate conference , COP30, has kicked off with representatives from more than 190 countries descending on the Brazilian city of Belém. They will spend two weeks deep in negotiations — likely contentious — on how to rein in dangerous global warming.\n \n\n   \n  COP30 is supposed to be the summit where countries really get down to the details of how they plan to halt catastrophic climate change. There’s a huge amount at stake. Last year was the  hottest on record,  capping a  decade  of unprecedented heat, and the impacts are already roiling the planet — from  hurricanes  and  floods  to  fires  and  extreme heat .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to expect over the next two weeks.\n \n\n   \n    What are COPs?\n \n\n   \n  In 1992, more than 150 countries signed a UN treaty to limit the alarming rise of planet-heating pollution.  The first COP — which stands for “conference of the parties” that signed this agreement — took place in Berlin in 1995. Member states have been convening almost every year since.\n \n\n   \n  A breakthrough moment came in 2015. At COP21 in Paris, more than 190 countries approved the  Paris climate agreement , pledging limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and preferably to 1.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement set out a vision but not a detailed roadmap. To flesh out how the warming limit would be achieved, countries committed to submit national climate plans every five years for keeping the 1.5-degree ambition alive.\n \n\n   \n  COP30 marks the latest cycle of these. Countries were supposed to submit their plans for cutting climate pollution up to 2035 by a February deadline.  More than 90%  of governments missed it. Most countries  have now submitted  their plans, but some, including big polluters like India, have not.\n \n\n   \n    Why has COP30 been controversial?\n \n\n   \n  The pathway to the summit has been chaotic.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s choice of Belém as the COP30 location was symbolic. The city is known as the “gateway to the Amazon,” and the aim was to focus minds on the existential danger the vast rainforest faces.\n \n\n   \n  But Belém was not set up for the influx that accompanies COP. The city typically has around 18,000 hotel rooms and is expecting roughly 50,000 people. A dearth of lodgings meant rates spiked, and some countries said they  were being priced out  of the conference and out of the rooms where decisions were being made about their survival.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil also faced criticism for its decision last month to  approve exploratory oil drilling  at the mouth of the Amazon River, only a few hundred miles from Belém. Environmental advocates accused the COP30 host of hypocrisy.\n \n\n   \n  Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has made tackling deforestation a core aim and used the COP30 summit opening on Monday to speak  strongly in favor  of tackling the climate crisis. But he also supports oil extraction and has rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don’t want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he  said  at a pre-summit meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible” for Brazil to quit oil.\n \n\n   \n    What are the main issues at COP30?\n \n\n   \n  Forests are high on the agenda. Brazil is keen to make this the “Amazon COP,” and Lula wants to raise $125 billion for a fund that would pay countries to protect their forests.\n \n\n   \n  The most contentious issues at the summit are likely to be around finance and fossil fuels.\n \n\n   \n  The wrangle over how much richer countries should give poorer ones to help them tackle climate change and adapt to the impacts they disproportionately face is likely to continue.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, at COP29 in Azerbaijan, nations agreed to  provide $300 billion annually by 2035 , with a wider ambition to reach $1.3 trillion from a range of sources. A roadmap for scaling up climate finance was published last week and will form the basis for what are likely to be contentious negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Then there are fossil fuels, the drivers of the climate crisis, which were mentioned in a COP final agreement  for the first time only in 2023  at COP28, when countries made an unprecedented call to transition away from oil, coal and gas.\n \n\n   \n  The world is different now, however. Trump is pushing for more fossil fuels, and some countries,  including many in South America , are rushing to exploit their oil and gas reserves. Petrostates and oil companies are  increasingly emboldened  to push back against any  language blaming fossil fuels  for climate change or committing to phasing them out.\n \n\n   \n    Does the world have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees?\n \n\n   \n  The  United Nations says no , at least not in the near term. In a report this month, the UN said countries had acted too slowly to limit climate pollution and it was all but certain the world would exceed 1.5 degrees, at least in the near term.\n \n\n   \n  Based on current policies, the world is on track for 2.8 degrees of warming, according to the UN. If governments’ new pledges for the future are met, this could be brought down to 2.3 to 2.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  It is progress; a decade ago, the planet was on course for around a 4-degree temperature rise. But even this reduced level of heating will cause devastation and could push the planet over catastrophic tipping points, including  the loss of coral reefs  and the  melting of the ice sheets .\n \n\n   \n  If 1.5 degrees is overshot, the world could bring temperatures back down, but it would be exceptionally challenging and involve sucking large amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere  using techniques unproven at scale .\n \n\n   \n    What about the US?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration will not  be sending a high-level delegation  to the summit. It follows a pattern of disengagement with global climate action that began with President Donald Trump  withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement  in January.\n \n\n   \n  The US rhetoric on climate action has heated up over the year, with Trump calling climate change “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” during a speech at the UN in September.\n \n\n   \n  The absence of the world’s biggest historical climate polluter from the summit will be keenly felt. Some experts fear it could give other countries license to dial down ambition.\n \n\n   \n  Others, however, believe the US absence may be beneficial as the Trump administration has proven a disruptive force in other global climate negotiations this year, helping derail what would have been two historic agreements: a  global plastics treaty  and  a tax  on the shipping industry’s climate pollution.\n \n\n   \n    What will come out of COP30?\n \n\n   \n  The closing session at the end of the two weeks is often delayed, sometimes by more than a day, as negotiators work around the clock to hash out a final agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions at COPs are made by consensus, meaning countries must agree on everything — a feature which technically gives any nation a veto and can make progress very slow and fraught.\n \n\n   \n  At COP30, the aim is to create a roadmap of action for the next decade, and the final outcome could include commitments on finance, adaptation to climate impacts, nature, the clean energy transition, and possibly phasing down fossil fuels, although this will be incredibly challenging given current geopolitical headwinds.\n \n\n   \n    Reasons to be positive?\n \n\n   \n  While the world waits to see what might emerge from Belém’s vast conference halls, there’s a  more positive story unfolding  in the real world. Clean energy, dominated by solar, is gaining pace.\n \n\n   \n  In the first half of 2025,  for the first time ever , renewables overtook coal as the top source of global electricity — a major milestone, according to analysts.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/shutdown-travel-problems-linger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Air Travel Faces Long-Term Disruption After Government Shutdown Ends","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown has significantly disrupted air travel, with the Federal Aviation Administration mandating a 10% reduction in flight capacity at 40 major airports.

Starting Tuesday, 6% of flights will be cut.\n \n\n   \n  The order calls for airlines to cancel flights seven days before they are scheduled to fly, and once they are canceled and passengers are informed, they can’t easily be reinstated.\n \n\n   \n  “There are significant challenges with these cancellations inside an airline, because it’s not easy to cancel randomly every day on 10% of our schedules and keep preserving those cancelations,” said Eash Sundaram, former chief digital and technology officer of JetBlue Airways. He now is the president of a technology venture fund called Utpata Ventures. “The airlines should be thinking about how hard it’s going to hit them in the next two to three weeks on the cancellations, and then the recovery process happens after that.”\n \n\n   \n  If controllers come back to the job, pilot and aviation consultant Kit Darby thinks it might take airlines a “week or two” to snap back.\n \n\n   \n  “If we can’t get it done this week (to end the shutdown), we’re starting to get to the point where it won’t be fully recovered by Thanksgiving,” Darby said. “I think if they do it this week, we can be very close to fully recovered by Thanksgiving.”\n \n\n   \n  However, passengers’ plans are in the hands of lawmakers to achieve a deal and secure a more reliable travel experience as the winter holidays creep closer.\n \n\n   \n    Controllers returning to work, or not\n \n\n   \n  Even when the government officially reopens, the number of controllers showing up to work might not immediately bounce back.\n \n\n   \n  Essential FAA employees who have worked during the shutdown will not immediately receive back pay, and some may choose not to return to work right away.\n \n\n   \n  The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said some of their members have taken second jobs and those side hustles may continue until they get their missed paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Nick Daniels, president of the union, said it took two to two and a half months for controllers to get all their back pay after the last shutdown in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump demanded Monday all controllers “get back to work, NOW” on Truth Social, recommending a bonus of $10,000 per controller who didn’t take time off during the shutdown. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later agreed with that sentiment, promising to work with Congress to reward controllers.\n \n\n   \n  Darby said in his experience, controllers go “above and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n  “They work extra hours, extra days,” Darby said. “Been doing it for a long time, have been poorly treated. But that’s just their nature.”\n \n\n   \n    Some controllers will never come back\n \n\n   \n  Some air traffic controllers will never return to their jobs and are retiring or quitting to find work where they will not be subject to government shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy told CNN, prior to the shutdown, only four controllers were retiring per day. Since the shutdown began, that’s changed to 20 to 25 retirees per day. Earlier this year the Department of Transportation offered bonuses to retirement aged controllers to stay on the job longer to help relieve the existing shortage, but the shutdown seems to be working against that effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be harder for me to come back after the shutdown and have more controllers controlling the airspace,” Duffy  told CNN on Sunday . “So, this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to have to find out how many actually resign, how many retired due to this shutdown, and truly start assessing all the different impacts the shutdown has,” Daniels said.\n \n\n   \n    The next generation\n \n\n   \n  Going into the shutdown, the nation’s air traffic control system was short by more than 3,000 workers, and a new effort to “supercharge” hiring this year has now been jeopardized by it.\n \n\n   \n  In September, before the shutdown, the DOT said it met its hiring goals for the year by recruiting more than 2,000 people. The FAA’s air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City was the “busiest” it has ever been,  an FAA official told CNN in July,  with roughly 800 to 1,000 more trainees in the pipeline than a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Classes at the academy have continued during the shutdown but left some students questioning if a job where they could have to go for weeks without pay is something they want to pursue, Duffy said.

If the shutdown is resolved no later than the end of this week or even this coming weekend, then airlines should have enough time to reassemble their schedules and get flights back operating at normal levels by the time it is Thanksgiving, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy even hinted Friday at hypothetically cutting capacity up to 20% of air traffic if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  “If (a 20% cut) happens, the US air transportation system will be crippled,” Harteveldt said. “It will be very, very difficult for travelers to get where they are going for Thanksgiving, because airlines will have exhausted all of the easy light cuts.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/snap-benefits-recipients-struggling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Many SNAP recipients are struggling — and confused — amid legal whiplash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Many SNAP recipients across the U.S. are facing severe financial and emotional distress due to a legal and political crisis over benefit disbursement.

recipients are struggling — and confused — amid legal whiplash \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Alisha Ebrahimji, René Marsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Trena Picou heard that the US Department of Agriculture agreed last week to issue partial  food stamp benefits  for November to comply with  a federal court order , she was hopeful that she’d get around half of her usual $263 allotment. The funds would help buy meat, potatoes, beans and rice for the two teen grandsons that she and her husband are raising.\n \n\n   \n  But the Houma, Louisiana, resident only received $64, which just covered a few packs of meat, cereal and milk and nearly brought her to tears.\n \n\n   \n  A few days later, her hopes were raised again when the  USDA said  it was processing full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, payments to comply with another court order. But the judge’s ruling was quickly  blocked by the Supreme Court , which left her depressed but not surprised.\n \n\n   \n  Now, she’s pinning her hopes on Congress soon  passing a spending package  that could reopen the federal government and get full SNAP assistance flowing again to tens of millions of Americans who depend on the aid to feed themselves and their families. The couple has had to use part of their disability payments to cover the grocery tab, leaving them worried about paying for rent and utilities.\n \n\n   \n  Though she’s had to deal with the uncertainty surrounding this month’s food stamp benefits since the  USDA announced in October  that it didn’t have the funds to pay them, the twists and turns of the past week or so have been “way worse.”\n \n\n   \n  “You make plans to buy groceries and then it’s gone,” Picou, 68, said of the potential to receive their benefits. “It’s pulling the rug out from under you, and you think ‘What am I going to do now?”\n \n\n   \n   Millions of SNAP recipients  like Picou have been suffering whiplash this month, with the USDA issuing  four different guidance memos  to states about distributing at least some benefits and the  two lawsuits  that aim to force the agency to issue payments working their way through multiple levels of the US courts system. A federal judge in Rhode Island first ordered USDA to provide  at least partial benefits  but last week expanded his ruling to require the agency to pay full benefits. The Supreme Court on Friday evening temporarily paused the judge’s order to require full payments to be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Senate voted Monday on a  short-term spending bill  that would reopen the federal government for now but fund SNAP for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The benefits are starting to hit enrollees’ EBT cards, but it varies greatly by state. Some recipients of the program have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others  remain in limbo , uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.\n \n\n   \n  With her eyes on the mail and ear to her phone, Katherine Broadway is on high alert for any piece of communication about the return of her vital food assistance, nearly $700 each month for her family of four. The only form of communication she’s received is an automated message about delayed payments from the number on the back of her benefits card.\n \n\n   \n  “It is getting absolutely frustrating for us,” she said. “We keep getting told one thing about SNAP and then five minutes later it’s not coming,” said Broadway, a retail worker from Northeast Ohio with two young daughters and a stay-at-home husband. “We are growing very impatient at this point for relief for the country in general.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the couple had to take a payday loan to afford groceries they’re hoping carry them throughout the next two weeks. Despite the stress of doing mental gymnastics to balance her pantry and refrigerator with her bank account, she is putting on a brave face for her daughters while holding onto hope that the tough times don’t last.\n \n\n   \n  “I won’t lie, I have my little mental breakdowns,” she said. “I will go in the bathroom and I will cry because I am feeling so overwhelmed.”\n \n\n   \n  In Grand Island, Nebraska, Anthony Harris continues to wait for his family’s $389 in monthly SNAP assistance, while his mother in California received her full allotment on Friday after the Golden State rushed to distribute full benefits to its residents. He checks his EBT card daily but has yet to receive any benefits. Nebraska’s SNAP website continues to say that November payments “may be delayed or disrupted” due to the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  When the USDA said last week that it would provide partial and then full benefits, Harris figured he could buy more food for his 16-month-old son, Anthony, Jr, who particularly likes ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs.\n \n\n   \n  “We actually thought we’d have food this month and not have to worry,” said Harris, 46, who along with his wife, Tanya, have been going hungry at times to make sure their son has enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Now he’s doubtful that Nebraska will provide even partial benefits anytime soon. So he is going to work full time at Burger King, even though his current part-time position leaves him in great pain in his back and feet.\n \n\n   \n  Even residents who have received at least partial benefits are confused and concerned. They are worried about spending the funds on their EBT cards since they’ve heard that USDA wants states to undo the distribution, said Jimmy Chen, CEO of Propel, an app that 5.5 million SNAP households use to manage their benefits. They think they may owe money to the government if they use the cards.\n \n\n   \n  Also, those receiving partial payments are asking Propel why they received that amount. They fear that a mistake was made or that they’ll get the reduced amount going forward, Chen said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of things we’re asking families to juggle right now,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  (A Department of Justice attorney, who is representing the USDA in court, told a federal judge Monday that the agency is not looking to rescind the funds on recipients’ cards.)\n \n\n   \n  For some SNAP beneficiaries, the ever-shifting landscape has just been too much to bear.\n \n\n   \n  While Onita Norris has tried to keep up with the constantly shifting legal and political developments surrounding SNAP funding, she admits she’s not tracking every update because it just causes “unnecessary added stress.” The Martinsburg, West Virginia, resident has yet to receive any funds for November.\n \n\n   \n  For her mental health, the single mother of two young children is limiting how closely she monitors the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I could obviously use the money, but I’m not going to keep logging in (into her SNAP account) and refreshing when it seems like they haven’t figured this out,” said Norris.\n \n\n   \n  Despite reports of a potential breakthrough in Congress to end the shutdown, she remains skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  “Just because they say it doesn’t mean that’s what’s going to happen,” she said. “Until I actually see something hit my account, it’s very much, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it.’”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/schumer-senate-shutdown-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Schumer Faces Liberal Fury Over Government Shutdown Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced intense backlash from progressive Democrats after voting against a government-reopening bill that included a compromise with Republicans, despite having previously supported centrist dealmaking in March.

didn’t vote for bill to reopen the government. He’s facing liberal fury anyway. \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer went out of his way to embody the anger of his Democratic base during this fall’s funding showdown with Republicans — an intentional turnaround from his capitulation in March that turned him into a villain in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  He’s still taking the blame from many in his party anyway.\n \n\n   \n  Despite voting against the final deal on Monday night, the New York Democrat is again being pummeled by vocal Democrats across the party, who argue he allowed his centrist members to strike a deal with the GOP that fails to prevent spiking health care costs for tens of millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  In the immediate aftermath of the deal, many of his own Senate Democrats were mum about whether they’d continue to support him as leader. Multiple House Democrats called for him to resign. And a raft of Senate candidates trashed him as they look to survive tight Democratic primaries in key races.\n \n\n   \n  There is no immediate threat to Schumer’s leadership, according to multiple Democratic sources. Not one of the Democrats calling for Schumer to step down as leader is a current member of his caucus. Still, frustrations are mounting privately among Senate Democrats that Schumer and his leadership team lacked a long-term plan to secure real concessions from the GOP in the funding fight— and that the party ultimately ended up without a tangible legislative win, according to a half-dozen Senate Democratic sources. And there is growing chatter about what it means for his future after the 2026 midterms and if he chooses to run again in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  “He did the right thing in March,” Sen. John Fetterman told CNN, referring to Schumer’s decision to work with Republicans to avert a painful shutdown earlier this year. “But I think he’s discovering that you can’t get back into the good graces of the Indivisible folks,” he said, referring to the far-left activist group.\n \n\n   \n  Though Fetterman has been a vocal critic of his party’s strategy, the Pennsylvania Democrat said he would not directly criticize Schumer: “I’m not going to put a blade in my leader.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona wouldn’t directly say whether he had confidence in Schumer. Asked by CNN about the Democratic leader’s handling of the shutdown, Kelly pivoted to President Donald Trump, whom he called “an irrational president who doesn’t care about the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed again on whether he had confidence in Schumer, Kelly conceded that it had been a “rough” time for Senate Democrats. “I’ve been here four and a half years now, and [Schumer has] been the leader, and I understand why people look at this and say, well, this was kind of a rough period,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, pressed if he had confidence in Schumer, was also mum on the leader’s future. “I was glad to see that kind of unity,” Van Hollen said. “I’m disappointed in the result, but we will fight on another day.”\n \n\n   \n  The current wave of ire at Schumer comes months after the New York Democrat faced fierce backlash for diffusing that first funding fight of Trump’s second term — earning praise from GOP leaders. But this fall as another funding cliff loomed, Schumer reversed his stance and said Democrats needed to fight for expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies to help Americans pay down their premiums. Privately, Schumer was not involved in the centrist dealmaking and instead focused on keeping centrists like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire from breaking with Democrats weeks earlier, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  One of those people, who is close to Schumer, said the leader was meeting with both centrists and progressives — convincing skeptical moderates to hold out longer, through the start of open enrollment on November 1. Separately, he was also strategizing with progressive colleagues like Sen. Bernie Sanders about how to keep the momentum up in the base to keep fighting. That person said it was a months-long effort by party leaders to keep the Senate Democratic caucus in line long enough to shut down the government — and force Republicans to talk about health care — for more than six weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Schumer was indeed working against the deal behind the scenes. “Senator Schumer didn’t want this to be the outcome, and pressed hard for it not to end like this,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But he also added: “He didn’t succeed. Let’s not sugarcoat that.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked about whether Schumer should remain as leader, Murphy instead said there must be a caucus-wide solution to centrist Democrats bucking their party to reach a deal. “This has happened over and over. You cannot defend democracy effectively if you are not united as an opposition party, and we are repeatedly showing that we are not united,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, Schumer’s long-time deputy and former roommate, ultimately broke with the Democratic leader to supply a critical vote for the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “He wasn’t happy about it,” Durbin told CNN when asked about Schumer’s reaction when he informed him about his position. “But he accepted it.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if Schumer tried to prevent him from breaking ranks, Durbin simply said: “We passed that point.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another key difference in the circumstances of this shutdown, compared to March: Schumer is getting backup from his fellow top New Yorker, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Monday whether he believed Schumer was effective and should keep his job, Jeffries said: “Yes and yes.” In other media appearances on Monday, Jeffries has instead pinned the blame on the leading centrist in the group, Shaheen, describing her group as “random” and saying he doesn’t know her.\n \n\n   \n  On a private call among House Democrats on Monday, one member after another tore into the Senate Democratic centrists, according to two people listening to the call. One progressive, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, name-checked Schumer specifically but was particularly riled up about the handful of Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance the deal on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “Damn the senators that caved,” Jayapal said in response to those members, according to those two sources on the call. Jeffries, meanwhile, urged his caucus to direct their ire at Republicans, one of those people said — eager to avoid a circular firing squad.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, urged his party to stay focused on the “main prize.”\n \n\n   \n  “People can have their opinions about the leaders, whether it’s Jeffries or Schumer, but all of us who are really appalled by what’s going on and the loss of health care, we have to stay focused on the main prize, and that is winning the next election so we have the capacity to push back and protect America,” Welch said.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic infighting, however, has already begun.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of Washington, the loudest attacks have come from Senate Democratic candidates competing in tough primaries around the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “This happened because Chuck Schumer failed in his job yet again,” Graham Platner, a Democrat who’s in a tight primary race to flip Maine’s Senate seat, said in a  video  posted to X.\n \n\n   \n  “The old way of doing things is not working. We need new leaders in the Senate,” added Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat who is running in her own competitive primary in Maine, in a  video  trashing the deal.\n \n\n   \n  A third Democrat running in a Senate primary, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, tore into Schumer in a CNN interview on Monday, arguing that he’s not in control of the Senate Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s got eight Democrats going rogue here,” Moulton said. “That’s not leadership.”\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, however, is far more muted in the current Senate Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  When asked how she felt Schumer handled the negotiation, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin told reporters, “I was disappointed yesterday.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to meet the moment and we’re not doing that.”\n \n\n   \n  Freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, though, made clear he does still back Schumer for leader.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he has confidence in Schumer, Gallego responded: “This was a decision made by eight people,” making clear he didn’t think the New York Democrat could have changed the minds of the Democrats who flipped.\n \n\n   \n  “They clearly had a momentum. They clearly had their own goals. I think we all spoke to enough of them to bring them back, but we couldn’t get all of them, and I think it was going to be difficult for them to do that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed again, Gallego said, “I have confidence in him, yeah.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/small-plane-crash-coral-springs-fl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00+00:00","title":"2 Dead After Small Plane on Hurricane Relief Mission to Jamaica Crashes in Florida Neighborhood","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small Beechcraft King Air plane, registered to International Air Services, crashed shortly after takeoff from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport in Coral Springs, Florida, killing father and daughter Alexander Wurm and Serena Wurm.

\n  A small turboprop plane on a hurricane relief mission to Jamaica crashed Monday morning into a pond in a gated residential neighborhood of the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Coral Springs, killing two people shortly after takeoff and narrowly missing homes, authorities and a local resident said.\n \n\n   \n  The Coral Springs Police Department confirmed the deaths in a statement Monday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The victims were identified as a father and daughter: Alexander Wurm, 53, and his daughter Serena, 22, according to  Ignite the Fire Ministry .\n \n\n   \n  “Together, their final journey embodied selflessness and courage, reminding us of the power of service and love,” the group, which was founded by Alexander Wurm, said.\n \n\n   \n  Coral Springs-Parkland Fire Department Deputy Chief Mike Moser said emergency crews responded within minutes of a call reporting the crash. Initially, no victims were located during rescue efforts and they shifted to a recovery operation.\n \n\n   \n  Moser said no homes were damaged, but crews spotted some debris near the retention pond. Local aerial televised footage showed a broken fence in the backyard of one home bordering the pond where the plane went down.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no actual plane to be seen,” Moser said. “They followed the debris trail to the water.”\n \n\n   \n  Kenneth DeTrolio told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that he and his wife were in their home when the plane crashed through their backyard, destroying his fence and toppling palm trees before hitting the water. He said the impact left debris scattered across his yard and that his pool and back porch were “contaminated” with spilled fuel.\n \n\n   \n  The fuel smell was so strong inside his home that it took a few hours to dissipate, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard the strangest sound. I never heard anything like it before, and apparently that was when this plane must have flown between my home and my neighbor’s house,” DeTrolio told the newspaper.\n \n\n   \n  Officials cautioned residents that police would maintain a significant presence in the area throughout Monday and Tuesday as investigators continue collecting evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Broward County, where the plane took off from and where the crash occurred, is home to a vibrant Caribbean American community that sprang into action to collect relief supplies following Hurricane Melissa. A powerful Category 5 hurricane, Melissa slammed into Jamaica late last month, leaving a path of destruction.\n \n\n   \n  Moser said police would take over recovery efforts, and federal aviation officials would investigate the cause of the crash.\n \n\n   \n  The small Beechcraft King Air plane took off from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport at approximately 10:14 a.m., according to a spokesperson for the City of Fort Lauderdale, which owns and operates the airport.\n \n\n   \n  The crash occurred soon after takeoff, with Coral Springs police officers and firemen responding at 10:19 a.m., just five minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the plane was manufactured in 1976. King Air models can seat between seven and 12 people, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.\n \n\n   \n  Federal records showed the registered owner of the plane is listed as International Air Services, a company that markets itself as specializing in providing trust agreements to non-U.S. citizens that enable them to register their aircraft with the FAA.\n \n\n   \n  A person who answered the company’s phone Monday afternoon declined to answer questions from a reporter, stating “no comment” and ending the phone call.\n \n\n   \n  The flight tracking website FlightAware shows the plane made four other trips to or from Jamaica in the past week, traveling between George Town in the Cayman Islands and Montego Bay and Negril in Jamaica, before landing in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. It was not immediately clear who was organizing the trips.\n \n\n   \n  Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on October 28, tied for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane in history. The storm also caused devastation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and prompted relief organizations to mobilize.\n \n\n   \n  Local government officials in Jamaica said in the days after the storm that Melissa had ripped the roofs off 120,000 structures, affecting some 90,000 families in the island’s especially hard-hit western region. A week after Melissa’s landfall in Jamaica, more than 2,000 people were still reported to be in shelters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/india/india-new-delhi-pollution-diwali-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:50:00.000Z","title":"After Festival of Lights, New Delhi Plunged Into Toxic Darkness and World’s Most Polluted Air","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi experienced record-breaking air pollution, with PM2.5 levels more than 40 times the World Health Organization’s safety guideline.

     2:50 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Around 20 million people in  India’s  capital woke up on Wednesday breathing the most polluted air of any major city in the world, a day after celebrations for the  Diwali festival , during which revelers typically set off fireworks and firecrackers.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday, New Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration – a measure of pollutants in the air – was more than 40 times the World Health Organization’s annualized guideline level, according to Swiss air quality monitoring company IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi grapples with severe year-round pollution, but the winter months are typically worst, when millions of farmers in surrounding regions burn stubble in their fields to clear the way for the next crop.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp deterioration in air quality this week comes following celebrations for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which traditionally involves the widespread use of firecrackers which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, as well as harmful heavy metals.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, authorities enacted a complete ban on making, selling or using firecrackers in New Delhi, citing hazardous pollution levels.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of so-called “green” firecrackers – which manufacturers claim are less polluting – but only within a certain time window. However, residents reported that this curfew was poorly enforced, with people bursting firecrackers long after the deadline, and that “non-green” firecrackers still appeared to be available.\n \n\n   \n  “Year on year, it goes from bad to worse,” said resident Anushka Singh.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old graphic designer said she usually stays at home at Diwali with her dog, to “help him through the incessant noise that doesn’t stop until late at night or early morning.”\n \n\n   \n  She described how her throat becomes scratchy, and her eyes begin to burn as she steps out of her home the day after Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  “Living in Delhi is a pain… I just wish that given the decades of data we would at least have stricter rules, ones that are actually implemented,” Singh said.\n \n\n   \n  Chandra Tandon, 52, who owns a corner store in the capital, said bursting crackers are “part of the fun and happens once a year,” but agreed that it becomes “difficult” for people who must endure the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  “I was breathing in those fumes throughout and it’s definitely not good,” she said. “It would be good if we left the crackers burning to the kids… If you’ve lived in Delhi long enough, you know how bad it gets every year with the pollution. So, adults at least should do their part.”\n \n\n   \n    A long-term crisis\n \n\n   \n  Despite the city being the political heart of the country, officials have had little success in cleaning up Delhi’s toxic air.\n \n\n   \n  Previous attempts to curb pollution have included sprinkling water on the roads, restricting traffic by requiring vehicles with odd or even license plates to travel on alternating days, and constructing in 2018 two smog towers worth 200 million rupees ($2.4 million), intended to act as giant air purifiers.\n \n\n   \n  But a lack of strict enforcement and coordination means progress has been slow, experts suggest.\n \n\n   \n  India is also desperate to fuel its booming economy and meet the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, three Indian cities, including New Delhi, were ranked among the world’s most polluted, according to air quality tracker IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  Kolkata in the east was in fourth place, while Mumbai in the west ranked number 10.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/cars/tesla-china-sales-fall-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00Z","title":"Tesla’s China Sales Fall to 3-Year Low Amid Tepid Demand","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tesla’s sales in China have dropped to a three-year low of 26,006 vehicles in October 2025, marking a 35.8% year-over-year decline and reducing its market share to 3.2%—its lowest in over three years.

in late Estée Lauder heir’s collection could fetch over $150 million at auction \n       \n  By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:55 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two years ago, Gustav Klimt’s final portrait — a vibrant portrait of an unidentified woman with a fan — topped the artist’s auction record  when it sold  for a staggering $108 million. The Austrian painter’s record is expected to be shattered again by a monumental, six-foot-tall portrait of a young heiress that was looted by the Nazis and nearly destroyed during World War II. Rarely seen for decades, it hung in the home of the Estée Lauder heir Leonard A. Lauder until the last years of his life (he passed away in June).\n \n\n   \n  Next week, “Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer” is expected to sell for above $150 million as the top lot in a sale of Lauder’s collection, hosted by Sotheby’s. The collection, which includes two other works by Klimt — both landscapes of Lake Attersee, estimated above $70 and $80 million — could fetch more than $400 million combined.\n \n\n   \n  Among the artist’s works, the portrait of Lederer, the daughter of his wealthiest Viennese patrons, is less known. Completed two years before Klimt’s death in 1918, the portrait features her in a gauzy, ornamental robe, surrounded by motifs from Chinese art. For many years, she kept a watchful eye over Lauder’s Fifth Avenue home in New York, with only occasional outings to be shown nearby, once at the Museum of Modern Art and a handful of times at Neue Galerie New York (founded by his brother). In 2017, however, Lauder loaned it to the National Gallery of Canada for its first extended stay, where it remained until earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  While in his home, the painting was a jewel of his collection, first displayed in his living room, then relocated to his dining room to make room for a large Cubist work by Fernand Léger, according to the art historian Emily Braun, who worked as Lauder’s art advisor for nearly four decades.\n \n\n   \n  “He ate lunch whenever he was at home, and lunch would be at a little round table right by the painting,” she said over the phone.\n \n\n   \n  Just a short walk away, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, millions of visitors each year pass by Klimt’s companion portrait of Lederer’s mother, Serena. Painted around 15 years prior, the stylistic shift between the two works is apparent. Serena’s portrait is wispy and spare, contrasting the bold, lush qualities of Elisabeth’s composition. Yet both have the same dark, potent gaze, Braun notes.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ll see that Klimt is either mesmerized by (Serena’s eyes), or is smart enough a painter to know to draw out this incredible coal blackness,” she commented.\n \n\n   \n    Marked by tragedy\n \n\n   \n  Both paintings avoided a calamitous end during World War II, when Nazis impounded the Lederer’s vast art collection for more than a decade. Many of their works by Klimt were shown in a 1943 exhibition in Vienna, then stored in Immendorf Castle, which burned down at the end of the war. But the family portraits, excluded from the exhibition because of their Jewish heritage, were separated and ultimately spared.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Lederer, just 20 years old at the time she sat for Klimt, was “an incredibly tragic figure,” Braun said. “Thank god this portrait survives.”\n \n\n   \n  Lederer lost everything before the war and died before it ended, at age 50, with the exact circumstances unclear. In the 1920s, as fascism began casting a long shadow, she became protestant and married a baron, but he divorced her just before World War II, the same year their young son died. Her family fled, but she remained in Vienna. She was vulnerable as a single Jewish woman, as Sotheby’s noted, so she claimed that Klimt, who died in 1918, was actually her father.\n \n\n   \n  “She was protected to a certain degree by this fabricated half-Christian, half-Klimt paternity, which was a ruse that was aided and abetted by her mother,” Braun explained. Klimt was a close family friend and her childhood drawing instructor, but he also had a reputation — allegedly fathering a number of children out of wedlock — “so this was just another example that was not far-fetched,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    A late-career masterwork\n \n\n   \n  Some works by Klimt have been the center of long sagas of  recovery and restitution , but in 1948, Lederer’s portrait was returned to her brother, Erich, who appears in drawings and paintings by Klimt’s friend and peer Egon Schiele. It remained in his possession until late in his life.\n \n\n   \n  The art dealer Serge Sabarsky acquired Lederer’s portrait in 1983, and sold it two years later to Lauder, who had taken a prudent interest in Klimt’s work. In the US, Klimt was a relatively obscure figure until the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum staged a joint exhibition with Schiele in 1965. Lauder, who was Hungarian and Czech, began collecting his works in the 1970s in part due to his own family’s ties to the region.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t emphasize enough that he was a real historian. He was fascinated by European history… and cultural history,” Braun said of Lauder. “So on the one hand, you have his direct family connection and heritage. On the other, you have the historian’s awareness of Klimt and what he represented at the apex of Viennese culture. And thirdly, you have the sheer beauty and aesthetic strength of these pictures, which he recognized immediately. He had an incredible eye.”\n \n\n   \n  Klimt may be best recognized by his golden period, during which he produced the gilded Art Nouveau icons “The Kiss” and “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.” But in the years before his death, at age 55, his geometric motifs became more fluid, his brushstrokes looser, and he was greatly influenced by East Asian art, of which he was an avid collector. The figures he painted around Lederer in her portrait were likely based on works of Chinese art that Klimt owned, according to Sotheby’s, while the Chinese dragon robe she wears in the painting was meant to be a striking symbol of power. It has been said that the artist did not want to part with the painting, which took years to complete.\n \n\n   \n  For a long time, the portrait of Lederer still carried the weight of her marriage — but that changed while in Lauder’s possession. Though Lederer was just 20 years old and unmarried when Klimt painted her, her portrait was called “Portrait of Baroness Elisabeth Bachofen-Echt” when he acquired it. Braun advised Lauder to change it, she recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “I said to Leonard, ‘It’s not right.’ This was commissioned while she was single. It was commissioned by her family, and her husband treated her so badly — why are we calling it by this title?” Braun said. “So we reverted to the original title, and that’s what it’s called now.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/china/china-gay-dating-apps-removed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"03:17:00-05:00","title":"Two of China’s most popular gay dating apps have disappeared from app stores","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two of China’s most popular gay dating apps, Blued and Finka, have been removed from Chinese app stores, reinforcing fears of a government crackdown on LGBTQ+ content.

had been erased from locally adapted platforms that serve Android devices.\n \n\n   \n  The Google Play Store app is blocked in China as part of the government’s vast censorship apparatus known as the ‘Great Firewall’.\n \n\n   \n  China operates one of the world’s  most extensive  online censorship and surveillance regimes that scrubs political dissent and criticism of the ruling Communist Party’s leadership and  ideologies , including a drive against feminine portrayals of men in pop culture.\n \n\n   \n  China’s LGBTQ+ community has faced an intensifying crackdown since Xi Jinping came to power more than a decade ago. Authorities have ramped up control over what they consider the undue influence of Western values, with  Pride parades canceled,  films and TV shows featuring same-sex themes banned, and China’s most popular messaging app WeChat  shutting down dozens of LGBTQ accounts. \n \n\n   \n  There has been no official announcement about the apps’ removal from the app stores in China, where regulators routinely remove content without explanation. But a source familiar with the matter told CNN that it appeared to be related to compliance issues.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Apple, Blued, Finka and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The apps have been accused of carrying pornography or “vulgar content” on its platforms, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple said it removed the apps from its China store after a request from the country’s internet regulator,  tech website Wired reported .\n \n\n   \n  “Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,” the phone maker said in a statement to Wired, adding: “We follow the laws in the countries where we operate.”\n \n\n   \n  Blued’s international version HeeSay remains searchable on app stores outside of China, while Finka operates solely within the country.\n \n\n   \n  The apps are hugely popular, with Blued reported as having 54 million registered users worldwide in 2020 and Finka 2.7 million, according to state media CGTN.\n \n\n   \n    Tightening space\n \n\n   \n  The latest narrowing of LGBTQ+ space came as the Supreme Court in the US  declined to revisit  its landmark precedent recognizing same-sex marriage. The Trump administration, however, has been scaling back federal diversity programs while piling pressure on the private sector to end similar initiatives.\n \n\n   \n  China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 but does not recognize same-sex marriage.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time China has reined in gay-dating apps. Grindr, which targets the international market, was removed from mobile app stores in China in 2022, citing difficulties to comply with a new privacy law.\n \n\n   \n  Blued, launched in 2012 to offer the local market a more approachable alternative, continued to operate alongside its rival Finka, which targets a younger demographic.\n \n\n   \n  Blued’s parent company BlueCity acquired Finka in 2020, a year after its debut.\n \n\n   \n  One user, surnamed Zhao, told CNN that the two apps enabled friends to meet especially in the less cosmopolitan parts of the country where places for gay people to gather are almost non-existent.\n \n\n   \n  “I just feel that there hasn’t been that much space offline for the gay community to begin with. Now that the online space is also being restricted, I feel that the space of the community is getting smaller and smaller,” said the 30-year-old, who gave only his family name for fear of speaking out against the authorities.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if their removal from Chinese app stores is permanent.\n \n\n   \n  Reinstatement is possible if the companies take steps to comply with Chinese regulators, the source who spoke to CNN said, although they were not optimistic, citing the tightening “ideological environment.”\n \n\n   \n  “Things are just difficult right now,” the source said, adding that Blued would likely have to “lay low and even transform” to survive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/asia/thailand-suspends-peace-accord-cambodia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"1110-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:39:00-05:00","title":"Thailand ‘halts’ peace agreement with Cambodia hailed by Trump after landmine explosion injures troops","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thailand has suspended its peace agreement with Cambodia, which was signed in late October 2025 in Malaysia and hailed by US President Donald Trump as a major diplomatic success, following a landmine explosion on the border that injured four Thai soldiers.

Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Malaysia in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the supreme commander of Thailand’s armed forces, Gen. Ukris Boontanondha, said he was “halting all agreements until Cambodia clearly and sincerely demonstrates that it will not be ‘hostile’,” according to a Facebook post from Thailand’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said: “Everything must stop.”\n \n\n   \n  “What we have been implementing all along — at this point, must now be considered halted until there is clarity,” Anutin said at the Royal Thai Police headquarters Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “What has happened has meant that the hostility that we thought would decrease against the threat to national security has not decreased. Since it has not decreased, we cannot proceed with anything beyond this.”\n \n\n   \n  The apparent major U-turn came after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand, on the volatile border with Cambodia Monday.\n \n\n   \n  One soldier’s right leg was severed in the blast, while another suffered shrapnel wounds to the leg, the army said. The incident happened while troops were on a “routine patrol along a frequently used route,” said Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Royal Thai Army.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand accused Cambodia of laying fresh landmines following the removal of a barbed wire fence, which was discovered on November 9.\n \n\n   \n  Winthai said the discovery “violates the signed joint declaration and will inevitably impact Thailand’s stance and various agreements.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot independently verify the claims that Cambodian troops laid fresh landmines.\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government said in a statement it “categorically denies the allegations,” adding that it has not deployed new landmines “and will never do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia also said it is “gravely concerned” about reports that Thailand has suspended the peace declaration and it remains committed to implementing the peace accord.\n \n\n   \n  “Most minefields, from nearly three decades of Cambodia’s civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s, along the Cambodia-Thailand border have not yet been cleared due to the difficult terrains and the un-demarcated status of the border areas,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation remains calm,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense spokesperson said Tuesday after military forces from both sides communicated following the landmine explosion.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement from Thailand also calls into question the already tentative release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, who were scheduled to be handed over under the terms of the declaration.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile peace agreement\n \n\n   \n  In late October, Trump traveled to Malaysia as part of his three-leg tour of Asia and presided over the signing of a  peace declaration  between the leaders of Thailand Cambodia amid lavish praise of the US president for his mediation efforts in the border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was considered by Trump as a major diplomatic victory, and another fillip to his much vaunted –  and often over-exaggerated  – campaign to have ended several wars.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought brief skirmishes in recent decades over their disputed border and the fighting earlier was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had warned the two leaders that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued – a threat that came as both faced elevated tariffs from the US under Trump’s global trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration included a commitment to withdraw heavy weapons from the border, de-mining efforts, and to de-escalate tensions that erupted into the brief but deadly border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement was built on the truce signed in July, but fell short of a “peace treaty,” despite Trump  repeatedly describing  it as such. And  analysts had cautioned  of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved.\n \n\n   \n  Anutin had qualified the signing ceremony as a “concrete step towards peace” that would hinge on “full implementation” of the declaration. And Thai diplomats were carefully reticent about the joint declaration, calling it a “reaffirmation” of a ceasefire  both sides agreed  to in July.\n \n\n   \n  Hun Manet, the prime minister of Cambodia announced at the time “a strong commitment to fully and faithfully implementing this joint declaration.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of landmines along the Thai-Cambodia border has also been a major point of contention for the Thais. The most recent border flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  In recent decades, Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry. The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony – that has periodically seen military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia has previously sought a ruling from the UN’s International Court of Justice over disputed areas. However, Thailand does not recognize the ICJ’s jurisdiction and claims that some areas along the border were never fully demarcated, including the sites of several ancient temples.\n \n\n   \n  The site of the most recent landmine explosion was in an area close to Cambodia’s Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has been at the center of previous military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration did not resolve the territorial dispute over the two countries’ shared border.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/israel-parliament-death-penalty-foreign-media-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:47:00-05:00","title":"Controversial death penalty and foreign media bills clear first reading in Israel’s parliament","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Israeli parliament has passed the first reading of two highly controversial bills: one expanding the use of the death penalty for terrorism and nationalist murder, championed by far-right minister Itamar Ben Gvir and supported despite initial opposition from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who reversed his stance after a ceasefire; and another allowing the government to shut down foreign media outlets without judicial review, modeled on the 2024 closure of Al Jazeera.

It now moves to a parliamentary committee for further debate and preparation ahead of the second and third readings.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Gvir has argued the measure would “ create substantial deterrence ” against terrorism and he threatened to withdraw his party from Israel’s coalition government if the bill was not put to a vote.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza. However, he has since reversed his stance following the implementation of a fragile ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Israel currently allows the death penalty only in exceptional cases, including for crimes such as treason and war crimes committed under the Nazi regime, but it has not been used for decades.\n \n\n   \n  The only person ever executed in Israel was Adolf Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust,  who was hanged in 1962  after he famously was  captured by Israeli intelligence agents in Argentina  and subsequently convicted in a landmark trial.\n \n\n   \n  Before Monday’s vote, Ben Gvir  declared on X  that “History will judge anyone who dares today to raise a finger against the death penalty law for terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  The bill also amends the military courts law, with jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, allowing courts there to impose the death penalty by a simple majority vote on the judge’s panel instead of a unanimous vote. It also rules out any option of allowing extenuating circumstances in the sentencing. Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to military law, while Israeli settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law.\n \n\n   \n  The UN has previously condemned Israel’s military courts in the occupied West Bank, saying that “Palestinians’ right to due process guarantees have been violated” for decades, and denounced “the lack of fair trial in the occupied West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  UN experts said last year that, “in the occupied West Bank, the functions of police, investigator, prosecutor, and judge are vested in the same hierarchical institution – the Israeli military.”\n \n\n   \n    Foreign media bill\n \n\n   \n  In the same session, lawmakers also approved the first reading of a separate bill that would allow the Israeli government to shut down foreign media outlets without a court order.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal seeks to formalize what has been dubbed the “Al Jazeera Law,” after the Qatari network’s operations in Israel  were shuttered in 2024  by the Ministry of Communications. The ministry accused Al Jazeera of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas through its coverage of the Gaza war.\n \n\n   \n  Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied those accusations and  condemned its closure  in Israel. Multiple Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza have also been killed by Israeli forces over the last two years.\n \n\n   \n  The new foreign media legislation, introduced by Likud lawmaker Ariel Kallner and backed by Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition, would make such powers permanent — even outside times of war or national emergency — and remove the requirement for judicial oversight.\n \n\n   \n  Reporters Without Borders (RSF)  condemned the proposal , calling it “the first nail in the coffin of broadcast media’s editorial independence in Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  “Against a backdrop of war and an upcoming election campaign, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is seeking to silence voices critical of the far-right coalition in power,” said RSF editorial director Anne Bocandé. “These legislative attacks will have lasting, negative consequences on Israel’s media landscape,” she warned.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/markets/warren-buffett-shareholder-letter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:59:00-05:00","title":"Warren Buffett: ‘I’m going quiet’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Warren Buffett, the 95-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced he will step down at the end of 2025 and cease writing the annual shareholder letter, though he will continue to deliver a Thanksgiving message.

But the 95-year-old is not going away just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett will no longer write the message atop the company’s annual report, but he will continue to deliver an annual Thanksgiving message, and he will “step up” his philanthropy, giving away the $149 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock he continues to hold.\n \n\n   \n  “The Oracle of Omaha” has become an investing icon, a billionaire who has cultivated a folksy image, particularly through his letters to shareholders. Although his market moves are closely followed by investors around the world, Buffett has also worked to present himself as a cheerleader for America and ordinary Americans – and for capitalism.\n \n\n   \n  He is being replaced by Greg Abel next year. Abel, 63, is the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire and was designated as Buffett’s successor in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett once again praised his successor, writing that he “has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire’s next CEO.”\n \n\n   \n  Buffett   also gave an update on his health, admitting that to his “surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.”\n \n\n   \n  But the nonagenarian isn’t getting any younger. Acknowledging the limited time he has left and the giant sum of money he wishes to give away, Buffett said he converted 1,800 shares, worth a combined $1.35 billion, into the company’s cheaper “B shares” and delivered them to four of his family’s foundations Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “To improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them, I need to step up the pace of lifetime gifts to their three foundations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett says he has high – but realistic – expectations that the conglomerate he led for six decades will continue to thrive after he steps down as CEO. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) shares have risen more than 10% this year, with the company sitting on a $1 trillion market cap.\n \n\n   \n  “In aggregate, Berkshire’s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems,” he wrote. “However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll.”\n \n\n   \n    The oracle and his ice cream\n \n\n   \n  Buffett has managed to become a symbol of two seemingly disparate things over his decades in the spotlight: a relentless dealmaker and capitalist, wrapped up in an avuncular figure dispensing practical advice.\n \n\n   \n  Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings are like those of no other company, dubbed Woodstock for capitalists, with an exhibit floor showing off many of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Buffett himself makes a point to appear on the floor and hype up those companies, from eating Dairy Queen ice cream to putting his face and name on limited-edition event merch, all while his security keeps back hordes of shareholding fans trying to take pictures or get a word in with the so-called Oracle of Omaha.\n \n\n   \n  His investing strategy has turned on an incessant search for value, with Berkshire Hathaway often sitting on giant piles of cash until just the right deal comes through. Few other CEOs have earned that level of patience from investors in a market that more often turns on expectations for short-term returns.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett expects the company to move on from him. But so much of Berkshire’s identity has become intertwined with its CEO. It’s hard to imagine the low-profile Greg Abel, for example, putting  his face on a ketchup bottle  to spur sales. Woodstock for capitalists might get just a little less festive from now on.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/asia/suharto-indonesia-national-hero-explainer-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"02:39:00-05:00","title":"US-Backed Dictator Suharto Named National Hero of Indonesia, Sparking Outrage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"General Suharto, a US-backed military leader who ruled Indonesia from 1966 to 1998, is posthumously named a national hero in a ceremony led by President Prabowo Subianto, a former son-in-law and military figure with a controversial human rights record.

These purges were supported by the United States, which provided intelligence, equipment, and funding to the Indonesian military.

His family has faced legal consequences, including a 2015 court order to repay embezzled funds, but Suharto himself never faced trial. The honor by Prabowo, who gained power with support from Suharto’s old party Golkar, reflects a political and cultural continuity with authoritarianism, raising alarms about a potential regression toward militaristic and repressive governance in Indonesia.

Why is he now being named a national hero? \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:39 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For decades, he was a feared US-backed dictator whose regime oversaw bloody Cold War-era massacres, accused of diverting huge amounts of state money to propel his family into luxury and political power.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, he was posthumously named a national hero of Indonesia – prompting protests from human rights groups and victims who decried the award as whitewashing a repressive regime that left hundreds of thousands dead, according to historians.\n \n\n   \n  Former President Suharto was granted the title in a ceremony by Indonesia’s current leader, Prabowo Subianto – Suharto’s former son-in-law, himself a divisive figure as a former general who faced his own allegations of human rights abuses while in uniform.\n \n\n   \n  “A prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,” an announcer said during the award presentation,  according to Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  But as the roiling controversy shows, that characterization is hotly debated – and Suharto’s legacy is anything but straightforward.\n \n\n   \n    Who was Suharto?\n \n\n   \n  Born in 1921 when Indonesia was still a Dutch colony, Suharto rose to power after the country gained independence in 1949, climbing the army ranks to become a five-star general.\n \n\n   \n  Then came a bloodbath in 1965, sparked by a failed coup and the murder of a number of generals in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto blamed the coup on communists, ousted then-President Sukarno – the country’s first post-independence leader – and sanctioned a hunt for those responsible.\n \n\n   \n  What ensued was a nationwide purge of alleged communists overseen by Suharto’s powerful military, with human rights groups and historians estimating that between 500,000 to one million people were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The United States supported the anti-communist massacres, providing lists of senior communist party officials, equipment and money to the Indonesian army, according to official documents that were  declassified in 2017 .\n \n\n   \n  In one document in late 1965, the US embassy in Jakarta sent a cable to Washington calling the crackdowns a “fantastic switch which has occurred over 10 short weeks,” along with an estimate that 100,000 people had been slaughtered, according to  the Associated Press .\n \n\n   \n  Many contend that those targeted during the purges were not communists but ethnic Chinese, or anyone with left wing views.\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, an international tribunal at the Hague found that the US, United Kingdom, and Australia were  all complicit  in the mass killings of 1965, which were deemed crimes against humanity.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto stayed in power for 31 years, during which he cracked down on critics and political opponents, and enforced his regime’s rule over territories including East Timor, Aceh, West  Papua  and the Maluku islands.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those territories were invaded with the tacit support of Western allies keen to prop up an anti-communist leader, at a time when proxy conflicts backed by the US and the Soviet Union raged across the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  He is praised by some for policies that fueled rapid economic growth and relative political stability. But at the same time, he siphoned off huge sums of money from state coffers, funding his family’s rich lifestyle and fueling public resentment.\n \n\n   \n  His rule finally came to an end in 1998 after the Asian financial crisis threw the country into economic turmoil, prompting widespread protests and forcing Suharto to resign – one of the last people power movements to sweep Southeast Asia and replace a Cold War-era autocrat with democracy.\n \n\n   \n  In the following years, Suharto’s children were prosecuted, and his youngest was convicted of corruption. In 2015, the Supreme Court ordered Suharto’s family to  pay back millions  in embezzled funds to the state.\n \n\n   \n  But Suharto himself never answered to his victims. Due to health problems in his final years, he died in 2008 without ever standing trial. He denied any wrongdoing until his death, at one point calling the embezzlement allegations “slander and defamation.”\n \n\n   \n    Why would Prabowo name Suharto a national hero?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not lost on many that Suharto was granted the posthumous honor by Prabowo – a longtime supporter of Suharto’s regime, and once a part of the strongman’s family.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo married Suharto’s daughter in 1983, though they divorced after Suharto was forced from power.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was also a military commander during Suharto’s reign and served in controversial campaigns in West Papua and East Timor, casting doubts over his own human rights record. He is accused of kidnapping activists during the 1998 mass protests that led to Suharto’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo has always denied the allegations that led to his dismissal from the military in 1998, the same year Indonesia broke free from Suharto’s authoritarian rule.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was  elected president in 2024  – with Suharto’s  former party, Golkar , throwing its support behind the candidate. During  his victory speech , Prabowo paid tribute to Suharto and thanked his ex-wife.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, some human rights experts voiced concerns that his presidency risked backsliding on the democratic gains made since Suharto’s authoritarian regime.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Prabowo has expanded the military’s role into what were considered civilian areas, measures  heavily criticized  by civil society groups who say it would bring Indonesia back to Suharto-era militarism and authoritarianism.\n \n\n   \n  Besides Prabowo’s involvement, there are also still a number of Suharto loyalists in Indonesia. His political heirs have also tried to  redeem his image  in the last decade, portraying him instead as a strong leader who brought stability to the country.\n \n\n   \n  In places like Kemusuk, a village near Yogyakarta where he was born, his image is everywhere – from museum memorabilia celebrating his life to the souvenir T-shirts with his smiling face.\n \n\n   \n  Discussion of his rule remains largely taboo in Indonesia, with mixed opinions about his legacy.\n \n\n   \n    What has been the response?\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the ceremony on Monday, activists gathered last week in Jakarta to protest against the act, holding placards that read: “Human rights violator” and “Suharto is not a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Human rights groups lambasted the choice, with Amnesty International describing it as an attempt to rewrite history and pointing out Prabowo’s familial ties to Suharto.\n \n\n   \n  Andreas Harsono, the Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, also condemned the move.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure to hold (Soharto) and his abusive generals to account facilitates the whitewashing and distortion of history that is now taking place under Prabowo,” he wrote  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  “This will make it even harder for Indonesian authorities now, and in the future, to end impunity for serious human rights violations and obtain justice for the victims and their families.”\n \n\n   \n  The title especially stings for the many survivors of violence and persecution under Suharto’s rule – and the families of his victims.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked, disappointed and angry with this government’s absurd decision,” Bedjo Untung told the  Associated Press.  Untong was imprisoned without trial for alleged Communist links between 1970-1979, during which he was tortured and his family faced hardship and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels deeply unfair, we are still living with the suffering until today,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto’s defenders have taken a different view.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to defend it ourselves… nothing is being hidden,” Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, Suharto’s daughter, told journalists after the ceremony on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have expressed our gratitude to the president for appointing our father as the national hero and maybe because he is also a soldier so he knows what my father had done,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Venezuela is experiencing a severe resurgence of inflation, with monthly rates estimated at 20–30% and projected to exceed 600% by 2026.

Venezuela’s streets \n       \n  By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces growing US  military pressure  and calls for his resignation, an old foe is returning to haunt him in his own backyard: Inflation, one of Venezuela’s chronic economic maladies, is on the rise again.\n \n\n   \n  “Prices are growing every day,” said Yon Michael Hernandez, 25, a motorcycle taxi driver in the slum of Petare, east of Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “Corn flour is 220 bolivars today, it may be 240 tomorrow and 260 the day after, and the same package that might have cost you one dollar 15 days ago is worth three now,” Hernandez told CNN. He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to make  arepas,  the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.\n \n\n   \n  In the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.\n \n\n   \n  In the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n  The surge in inflation is linked – although only partially – with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.\n \n\n   \n  While a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Only last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country’s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.\n \n\n   \n  According to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.\n \n\n   \n  This also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.\n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.\n \n\n   \n  “Not many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,” said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. “Dollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.”\n \n\n   \n  A typical breakfast of croissant and  café con leche  now can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country’s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.\n \n\n   \n  The stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.\n \n\n   \n  “I had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it’s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,” said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n    War on inflation, one detention at a time\n \n\n   \n  The central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly afterward, things began to unravel.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.\n \n\n   \n  The economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.\n \n\n   \n  For this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela’s finances, and is waiting for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Both consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.\n \n\n   \n  Prices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Faced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of “manipulating exchange rates.” Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  The moves have done little to stop the bolivar’s fall.\n \n\n   \n    Several causes\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.\n \n\n   \n  For 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela’s inflation to top 600% by next October.\n \n\n   \n  The bolivar’s plunge can be partially explained by the US military’s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  US sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.\n \n\n   \n  In July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron’s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  CNN contacted Chevron for comment but has not received a response.\n \n\n   \n  The change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The future is crypto\n \n\n   \n  To make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Today, thousands of Venezuelans – from corporate bankers to retirees – regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has embraced the new normal. “Sending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,” said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. “Now it’s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senate-vote-negotiations-deal-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:11:00.000-04:00","title":"Bipartisan Deal Ends 38-Day Government Shutdown After Moderate Democrats Break Ranks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 38 days of government shutdown, a bipartisan deal was reached between moderate Democratic senators—Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan, Angus King, and Tim Kaine—and Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune.

Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan, Angus King and Tim Kaine had yielded a deal that  eight Democrats broke ranks  to advance. By Monday evening, the Senate had  voted 60-40   to pass the measure, which now heads to the House before  President Donald Trump  – who’s signaled support — can sign anything.\n \n\n   \n  The government could now be reopened by the end of the week. What comes next is far less certain, with questions looming about the fallout for both parties as Democrats face internal recriminations and Republicans are forced to grapple with the political liabilities of rising health care premiums.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has sought to limit its public comments on the deal, wary of disrupting a tentative agreement that still faces a tricky path through the House. But internally, the sudden end to the impasse prompted a sense of vindication that the outcome that officials had predicted for weeks had finally come to pass, people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his top aides had decided in September to take a hard line against negotiating with Democrats, confident that the party would cave as soon as it became clear they wouldn’t win any concessions from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he made a mistake in going too far,” Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in an interview Monday about Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the deal later Monday but who had been kept in the loop on the moderates’ conversations with Thune, one of the sources familiar said.\n \n\n   \n  “He just went too far. He thought he could break the Republicans, and the Republicans broke him,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  But reaching that point took far longer than anyone in the White House anticipated; many officials believed Democrats would fold in a matter of hours to days. It also came at a cost, with Trump and Republicans taking the brunt of the public blame for the shutdown, culminating in a brutal set of state-level electoral losses last week.\n \n\n   \n  Spooked by those results, Trump in recent days had begun urging Republicans to abandon their strategy and unilaterally open the government by  eliminating the filibuster  — an idea that proved deeply unpopular with GOP leaders and succeeded only in dividing his party.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even as urgency built within the administration to find an end to the shutdown, officials contended that a similar level of pressure must be building on the Democratic side. In the weeks leading up to Sunday’s breakthrough, Trump aides  had privately discussed minor concessions  they might be willing to make to help Republican senators clinch an eventual deal, two people familiar with the deliberations said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, few expected the opportunity would come when it did, with Democrats riding high from the elections and their base louder than ever in urging them to hold the line.\n \n\n   \n  As the talks between Democratic moderates and Thune accelerated, some of the potential concessions that aides had contemplated quickly became a central component of the bipartisan agreement, as Democrats pressed for a reversal of the mass firings of federal workers that the administration had carried out during the shutdown and protections against future layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The White House agreed. On Monday, Kaine told CNN that a provision barring further reductions in force through January had been key to convincing him to sign on to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one negotiating the federal worker protections, and when I got a yes from the White House at 4:45 yesterday on the key component of guaranteeing no future RIFs, that was very persuasive to me,” the Virginia Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats were also able to secure furloughed federal employees’ back pay — but not the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that had been their original and consistent demand.\n \n\n   \n  The acceptance of the deal came from a realization among Democrats that Republicans simply were not going to cave on that issue.\n \n\n   \n  “The question I was wrestling with is: if the tactic isn’t working and there were no prospects that it was going to work, then let’s move on, not make a lot of other people suffer in order to get a goal that wasn’t attainable,” King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on CNN Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  There was immediate blowback. Leading Democratic figures and potential 2028 presidential candidates railed against the deal and its negotiators. House Democratic leadership even urged their members to put out statements calling on Democratic senators to hold the line Sunday night, a source familiar with the messaging push told CNN, and a range of House Democrats rushed to announce their “no” votes.\n \n\n   \n  But within the group of eight Democratic senators, the lawmakers argued that they’d made the only sensible move available, especially as the pain mounted for everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome,” said Shaheen, who’s not running for reelection to her New Hampshire seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  While the quartet of Democratic former governors had worked in overdrive through a combination of meetings and phone calls out of King’s Senate hideaway, those negotiations hadn’t just begun over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, Hassan — also from New Hampshire — and King had been quietly talking with Republican leadership for weeks to lay the groundwork for a deal. Thune had long said that the path toward a deal would be through conversations with rank-and-file Democrats, not Democratic leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine told reporters that he spoke with Thune and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama throughout the negotiations over the weekend and made the case directly that the deal needed to include a moratorium on firings of federal employees.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether he wished Democrats had cut a deal sooner, Kaine, who didn’t truly join the negotiations until after Tuesday’s elections, said of Republicans: “I didn’t fully understand how dug in they were.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, moderate Democrats had agreed to give Schumer and their fellow Democratic senators one last shot to do it their way on Friday, filing into the chamber behind the New York Democrat as he presented his party’s latest offer to open the government in exchange for extending the ACA subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But Republicans rejected it as a nonstarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Plan A was over on Friday when Republicans ruled it out,” one of the sources familiar with the negotiations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The eventual deal they did accept, however, presents a new quandary for the GOP. With Thune promising a separate vote on the subsidies next month, White House aides are already turning their attention to hashing out a coherent position on health care.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the question is how they push back on the inevitable Democratic narrative that Republicans are killing health care in the US,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. “What is the Republican response to the inevitable refrain: ‘They don’t have a plan.’”\n \n\n   \n  Said Shaheen: “We have a guaranteed vote by a guaranteed date on a bill that we will write, not that the Republicans will write.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on Republicans’ message on health care during a Fox Business interview on Monday, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair indicated the answer remained a work in progress.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a good plan to be able to address some of these issues that will begin to be worked on in earnest now,” Blair said, without offering specifics. “I expect that we’ll see action on that very soon.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senate-vote-government-shutdown-funding","dateOfPublication":"1000-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:50:00-05:00","title":"Senate votes to end government shutdown, sending funding bill to the House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan funding measure to end a 41-day government shutdown, with 60 votes (including eight Democratic senators and all but one Republican) supporting the bill.

government shutdown, sending funding bill to the House \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Morgan Rimmer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:50 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A small band of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans on Monday night to approve a funding measure to reopen the federal government — without securing their party’s demand to guarantee an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford insurance.\n \n\n   \n  The funding compromise will now go to the House, where GOP leaders are hopeful it could pass as soon as Wednesday and end the longest-ever US shutdown. The recently struck deal, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign, would restore critical services like federal food aid, as well as pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  Eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus crossed the aisle to join with Republicans in the 60 to 40 vote. One Republican voted in opposition: Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  That shutdown has been politically painful on Capitol Hill. Republicans have repeatedly shouldered blame in  recent polling  for the funding lapse. And the deal, struck by Democratic centrists in the Senate, has ignited a fight within the party about its strategy in the already 41-day funding fight — and where they go next.\n \n\n   \n  Most Democrats were eager to keep fighting even as centrists declared that with Trump dug in, there was no real chance of securing policy wins on health care. Instead, those centrists secured the promise of a future vote on a health care bill of their choosing, which Democrats are determined to win GOP support on. It is far from guaranteed, however, that the bill will survive the Senate, let alone the House.\n \n\n   \n  The vote late Monday night caps a frenetic few days of negotiations inside the US Capitol, with quiet negotiations between the Senate centrists, GOP leaders and the White House throughout the weekend before formally unveiling their deal on Sunday. A bloc of eight members of the Democratic caucus took a critical first step to support that measure Sunday night, and all eight gave it final approval on Monday night.\n \n\n   \n  Those eight lawmakers were: Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin, Maggie Hassan, Tim Kaine, Jeanne Shaheen, Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman, Jacky Rosen and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  While he did not vote for the final deal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has drawn fury from the party’s left for allowing those centrists to strike the deal without any real wins on the Affordable Care Act subsidies that will soon expire and hike premiums for millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Many Democrats in both chambers believe the party will be forced to relive the fight again on January 30, when the next tranche of funding runs out. The broader legislative package, however, would fund several key agencies, including ones that run federal food aid, as well as the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program, and veterans programs, through the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Now, attention will turn to House Speaker Mike Johnson and members of the House, who are making their way to Washington after being in their districts since mid-September.\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to vote on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government as early as 4 p.m. on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer. The notice forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican speaker is likely to need the president’s help to muscle the package through his fractious conference in the coming days. But in an optimistic sign Monday, Trump told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins “I would say so” when asked if he personally approved of the deal making its way through the process on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ellis Kim contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-china-france-students-universities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:55:00-05:00","title":"Trump defends enrolling Chinese students at US universities — and takes a swipe at France","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump defended the continued enrollment of Chinese students at U.S. universities, arguing that such students bring valuable intellectual diversity and are not subject to the same espionage concerns as French students.

\n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:55 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President  Donald Trump  criticized the nation of France on Monday in a back-and-forth with a Fox News host as he defended the enrollment of Chinese students at universities in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “I actually think it’s good to have outside countries,” the president said when asked about enrolling Chinese nationals at American universities.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not the French. They’re the Chinese. They spy on us. They steal our intellectual property,” Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham responded.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you think the French are better?” the president retorted.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah,” Ingraham said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not so sure,” the president responded.\n \n\n   \n  There has been some tension between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron throughout Trump’s second term. Some of it has centered over Russia’s war in Ukraine, as well as the Israel-Hamas war.\n \n\n   \n  Macron was the first Western member of the United Nations Security Council and first G7 nation to announce that his country would  recognize a Palestinian state. \n \n\n   \n  Trump  met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping  at the end of last month while the president was traveling through South Korea. The US president said that the two leaders came to an agreement on “almost everything.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the Trump administration said it was going to  “aggressively revoke”  Chinese student visas before ultimately reversing course on that move.\n \n\n   \n  According to the Institute of International Education, China has consistently been one of the main sources of international students to the US - approximately 1 in 4 international students in the United States are from China.\n \n\n   \n  For decades, American universities have attracted some of China’s brightest minds. Seen as a path to a prestigious education and better career opportunities, US colleges have drawn Chinese students from middle-class families as well as the political and business elite.\n \n\n   \n  China was the top source of international students in the US for 15 straight years until it was surpassed by India just last year, according to figures from Open Doors, a State Department-backed database tracking international student enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of growth, the number of Chinese students in the US reached a peak of over 372,000 in the 2019-2020 school year, before declining to more than 270,000 in the 2023-2024 year – a drop that coincides with the Covid-19 pandemic but also increasing friction between the two governments.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/europe/british-journalist-hamdi-ice-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00-05:00","title":"British journalist Sami Hamdi expected to be released from ICE detention and return to UK","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after overstaying his visa during a speaking tour in California, is set to be released and return to the UK.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, who has been held by US federal immigration for over two weeks, is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  The London-based journalist and commentator, who was visiting the United States on a speaking tour,  was detained  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month as he went through San Francisco International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. But Muslim advocacy groups say that his visa was revoked during his trip without cause or prior notice. Hamdi’s family believe his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories was the real reason behind the decision.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Hamdi had opted to accept a US government offer to leave the country voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  “The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country” in a statement Monday. McLaughlin characterized Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE records show Hamdi was still in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer on Monday welcomed the US decision to release the British national.\n \n\n   \n  “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said the US government provided “no evidence” to justify his detention.\n \n\n   \n  “If they want him out of the country, why not simply let him go?” she posted to Instagram. “Why is the US government holding a British journalist without charge?”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV.  He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/camp-mystic-texas-flooding-lawsuits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00.000-05:00","title":"Families of 9 Camp Mystic Flooding Victims File Lawsuits Alleging Gross Negligence After 27 Girls and Counselors Died","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the deadly flash flooding at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas, on July 4, 2025, which killed 27 children and counselors, the families of victims have filed three lawsuits against the camp and its owners, the Eastland family.

who perished in the  July 4 tragedy : Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  A second lawsuit was filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck, an 8-year-old who also died in the disaster, an attorney for the family said. The third was filed by the family of 9-year-old Ellen Getten.\n \n\n   \n  Each lawsuit seeks more than $1 million in damages.\n \n\n   \n  They mark the first legal action taken by victims’ families against the camp since the flooding that claimed their daughters’ lives.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuits’ defendants include Camp Mystic and members of the Eastland family, which owns the 99-year-old camp in Kerr County, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to pray for the grieving families and ask for God’s healing and comfort,” a statement from the camp read Monday evening.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen campers and staffers –  the “Heaven’s 27,”  as they are known – died in the predawn hours of July 4 after torrential rainfall caused flash flooding at the century-old summer camp in Texas Hill Country.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the  youngest victims were housed  in cabins along the banks of the Guadalupe River.\n \n\n   \n  Richard “Dick” Eastland, who co-owned the  all-girls Christian  camp with his wife, Tweety, died while he was trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n  The flooding killed at least 136 people across the region, as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about  3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes .\n \n\n   \n     What the lawsuits allege \n \n\n   \n  The first lawsuit, filed by the families of five campers and two counselors, accuses Camp Mystic of not having adequate safety plans and prioritizing money over safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the filing says. “The Camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins. The Camp chose not to make plans to safely evacuate its campers and counselors from those cabins, despite state rules requiring evacuation plans, and not to spend time and money on safety training and tools.”\n \n\n   \n  “On July 4, the Camp chose to take no steps to protect its campers and counselors while it knew a storm and ‘life threatening flash flooding’ were approaching,” the first lawsuit states. “Instead, with the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors. The Camp chose not to evacuate its campers and counselors, even as floodwater reached the cabins, until counselors demanded it.”\n \n\n   \n  The “Camp chose not to evacuate the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins when other campers and counselors had been moved to safe, higher ground just 300 feet away,” the suit says. “Instead, the Camp chose to order its campers and counselors to remain in the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins while the flood waters overwhelmed the camp. Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died.”\n \n\n   \n  “We carry the memory of our daughter in everything we do. This legal step is one of honoring her, and we believe that truth and justice are essential to finding peace – not only for our family, but for every family affected,” said Ryan DeWitt, who lost his daughter, Molly.\n \n\n   \n  The second lawsuit, filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck, accused Camp Mystic of “gross negligence” by “failing to implement modern safety measures or update its own flood protocols in light of known dangers.”\n \n\n   \n  “These terrifying last moments and then deaths were proximately caused by the negligence and gross negligence of Defendants,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants knew that camp facilities were located in a flood zone, knew of the history of flash flooding in Kerr County, knew of repeated prior flood events at the Camp, and received warnings from family members about flood risk.”\n \n\n   \n  A third lawsuit was filed by the parents of Ellen, one of the youngest girls at the camp and who was housed at Bubble Inn cabin.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges the camp’s directors and owners should have been aware of an emergency response activation in the area ahead of the major flooding and should have been on “high alert.”\n \n\n   \n  The defendants had enough time to evacuate all the campers and prevent injuries and death, the lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “At the very least, Camp Mystic had more than enough time to train, educate, and instruct counselors and campers alike of a true evacuation plan should the weather continue to grow in severity through the day and into the night,” the lawsuit states. “However, the Defendants chose to do nothing after this alert to protect Ellen’s and the other campers’ lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, a plan to evacuate the campers came more than 12 hours after a flash flood warning, the lawsuit alleges. That plan was “wholly inadequate and purposefully left some of the youngest children in Bubble Inn completely stranded without instruction, direction, or adult emergency assistance before their tragic deaths,” according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “The Camp’s failure to act led to utter chaos and mass panic,” the lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuits seek a jury trial in Travis County District Court. And they demand compensation for “mental anguish,” among other damages.\n \n\n   \n    The camp responds\n \n\n   \n  “We empathize with the families of the campers and counselors and all families in the Hill Country who lost loved ones in the horrific and unprecedented flood of July 4,” Jeff Ray, legal counsel for Camp Mystic, said in a statement Monday after the lawsuits were filed.\n \n\n   \n  “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area,” the statement continued. “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts for comment on the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview with CNN last month , Watts addressed some of the questions and concerns that had been raised by families.\n \n\n   \n  He said the first warning came at 1:14 a.m., but “there’s some question as to who got it and who didn’t, because this is a very remote area with limited cell phone coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  At 1:47 a.m., Dick Eastland and his son Edward “immediately convened the ground crew and started securing equipment, started coming up with a plan at about 2” a.m., Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “At about 2:19, we got the first information that one of the houses was having water coming,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Before 3 a.m., “there was a very orderly evacuation process of 10 different camps or cabins,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  He also challenged the notion that evacuating children during flash flooding is always the best option.\n \n\n   \n  “You shelter in place. That’s first and foremost what you ought to do,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n   “ Do not take 9-year-old girls who weigh 63 pounds on average into raging floodwaters. They’re going to get washed away.”\n \n\n   \n    Anger and grief lead to change\n \n\n   \n  The deaths at Camp Mystic have led to sharp questions from parents and lawmakers about the camp’s safety and evacuation plan in an area known to flood on a regular basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Obvious commonsense safety measures were absent. Protocols that should have been in place were ignored,” said CiCi Williams Steward, the mother of 8-year-old Cile, who remains missing. “She was stolen from her family, from her future, from the world she lit up with her independence and spunk.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed  tougher camp safety laws  that require local governments to install outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the Camp Mystic attorney  offered an in-depth timeline  of how camp leaders responded to the flood warnings and rising waters. They safely evacuated 166 girls thanks to their quick efforts, Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an unprecedented, once-in-a-thousand-year event, that nobody thought was even possible,” he said. “It’s never happened before.”\n \n\n   \n   Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen  this coming summer for its 100th anniversary. The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-search-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00-05:00","title":"Wig disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early November 2025, authorities in Santa Barbara County launched an investigation into the disappearance of 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard, who was last seen on October 9 near the Colorado-Utah state line after her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, took her on a 1,000-mile road trip across six states.

disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:24 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s been a month since Ashlee Buzzard packed her 9-year-old daughter Melodee into a rental car and left their home state of California — only to return three days later with no child and plenty of unanswered questions in tow, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  As investigators  search for Melodee , they say their probe has uncovered a series of wigged disguises, a sprawling multistate road trip, and an “uncooperative” mother who has provided “no verifiable explanation” of her daughter’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The case took an unexpected turn on Friday when  Buzzard, 40, was arrested  on a charge of false imprisonment — but not for the disappearance of her daughter. “This crime is not connected to the ongoing search for Melodee, however, detectives are unable to fully outline the crime as it would impede their ongoing investigation,” the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the case — and the many questions that still remain.\n \n\n   \n    A concerned school official noticed Melodee’s ‘prolonged absence’\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on October 14, not by her family but by school administrators who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in.\n \n\n   \n  School district officials in the child’s hometown of Lompoc say Melodee was enrolled in August in an independent study program, which allows students to learn from home. That was  the last month  she was seen by the school, the sheriff’s office has said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear whether the school last saw Melodee virtually or in person, but the sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  The school’s August sighting helped narrow detectives’ timeline at the beginning of the investigation, when authorities were working with outdated childhood photos and family members who said they had not seen Melodee for years.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years. The aunt said their extended family largely lost contact with the child after her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  When Melodee’s school asked for a welfare check on October 14, officers arrived at her mother’s home but only found Buzzard, who “provided  no verifiable explanation  for Melodee’s whereabouts,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found.\n \n\n   \n  The  sheriff’s office  said this week Buzzard “has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n    Melodee likely disappeared during a whirlwind multistate road trip\n \n\n   \n  Detectives have narrowed their investigation to a small but very eventful three-day window from October 7-10, in which they believe the mother drove Melodee more than 1,000 miles away — as far as Nebraska — crossing at least six states and trading license plates and disguises as they went.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the three-day trip, Buzzard returned home with the rental car, this time without Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Melodee was seen was on October 9 in an area around the Colorado and Utah state line. Here’s what  investigators say happened  on their trip:\n \n\n   \n  Finding Melodee now hinges on detectives unearthing what happened to the girl after she was last seen on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office released a  travel-route map  of where they believe the mother and daughter traveled between October 9 and 10, and is asking businesses, gas stations, hotels, rest stops and residents along the route to review surveillance camera footage that may catch a glimpse of the child.\n \n\n   \n    A series of wigs may have provided quick disguises, investigators say\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who came across the mother and daughter may not recognize them in some publicly released pictures, as authorities believe Buzzard may have taken steps to conceal their identities, including tucking her daughter’s ringlet curls under a smooth wig.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc on October 7 showed Buzzard and Melodee in what appeared to be wigs, the sheriff’s office said in a release that  shared a clip  of the video.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, authorities say Buzzard appeared to swap wigs, trading fake, honey blonde curls for a darker wig closer to the style Melodee was seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel,” the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate  KSBY  that when she first saw the surveillance images, she was overwhelmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was totally numb and in shock. … This is just so shocking to me in that my granddaughter is dressed in a disguise,” Denes told the affiliate.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” the grandmother said. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”\n \n\n   \n    Mother is accused of falsely imprisoning someone in unrelated charge\n \n\n   \n  In a sudden turn of events on Friday, the sheriff’s office  announced  while they were investigating Melodee’s disappearance, they learned her mother had recently “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  “Although this arrest occurred during the course of the missing person investigation, it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard has been charged with a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She is being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say the incident happened in Lompoc on November 6 and involved a person who is not Melodee, but investigators have so far been reluctant to share more details.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest comes about a week after the  FBI served search warrants  at Buzzard’s home and a storage locker, as well as the rental car Melodee was last seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may have information about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/us/ashlee-buzzard-arrest-melodee-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:09:00+00:00","title":"Mother of Missing 9-Year-Old Melodee Buzzard Arrested on False Imprisonment Charge","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, the mother of missing 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard, Ashlee Buzzard, was arrested on a felony charge of false imprisonment in Lompoc, California.

 \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former world  chess  champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment following the death of fellow player  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator.

\n        6:12 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  So much of the coverage of President Donald Trump’s pardons is focused on how political they are. And they are certainly political — extraordinarily so.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s  latest batch of pardons  reinforces, that’s only half the story.\n \n\n   \n  The more ominous trend is not just that he’s pardoning political allies; it’s that he’s pardoning allies  in very transactional ways .\n \n\n   \n  He’s pardoning lots and lots of people who helped Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  After previously dangling pardons over allies involved in sensitive investigations involving Trump himself — and later delivering those pardons — he’s now pardoned oodles of people who took illegal or legally dubious action on his behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is creating a permission structure in which people will credibly think they can’t be held accountable in federal court, as long as what they’re doing benefits Trump. He’s been cultivating this for a long time, but he seems to be getting more brazen about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most recent pardons, which were announced overnight by Justice Department official Ed Martin, are for 77 people who played roles in trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. These officials include former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, along with many of the people involved in the so-called fake electors scheme.\n \n\n   \n  The pardons are symbolic, in that these people haven’t actually been charged with federal crimes. Some of them face state-level charges, for which Trump cannot pardon them.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s also what makes these so notable. Trump is using this symbolic gesture to expand the ranks of people who went to great and legally dubious lengths to help him try to overturn the 2020 election and who later received pardons.\n \n\n   \n  When you combine these new pardons with the pardons and commutations given to  January 6, 2021, defendants  and Trump allies who testified in cases involving the president, across his two terms Trump has now pardoned more than 1,650 people who played significant roles in matters involving him personally.\n \n\n   \n  Those people account for more than 84% of pardons and commutations awarded by Trump. (Trump has otherwise  been remarkably stingy  with his clemency powers, when the matters didn’t involve him or his allies.)\n \n\n   \n  And many of these people engaged in violence,  including against police , in the name of helping Trump.\n \n\n   \n  What message does that send to other people who might go to remarkable lengths to help Trump carry out his agenda? To participate in legally dubious administration actions — things like  its boat strikes in the Caribbean ? To carry out his deportation agenda in rather brutal ways? Or to perhaps even try to help him stay in power, as more than 1,600 people did before receiving pardons for their actions?\n \n\n   \n  The sheer volume of these self-serving pardons is hardly the only indicator that Trump is wielding them for political and transactional purposes.\n \n\n   \n  Official reports from the various Russia investigations referred to how Trump  appeared to dangle pardons  over people who were in positions to provide potentially derogatory information about him. These people included former advisers Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  Special counsel Robert Mueller  said in his report  that Trump’s repeated comments about potentially pardoning Manafort “had the potential to influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government.”\n \n\n   \n  All were later pardoned by Trump in his first term. And perhaps most notably, Trump’s pardon of Manafort came after Manafort lied to investigators in ways that threw them off in a key portion of the probe.\n \n\n   \n  Manafort’s lies came after he cut a deal to cooperate with investigators. A bipartisan Senate report seemed to  regard these lies as particularly inexplicable , given they opened Manafort up to much more prison time.\n \n\n   \n  But ultimately, Manafort’s gamble appeared to pay off with Trump, when the president gave him the pardon he had repeatedly dangled as a potential reward for staying loyal.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Mueller report and the Senate report also referred to how Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said he was led to believe the Trump White House would help him with his pardon  if he stayed in line.\n \n\n   \n  Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he discussed a potential pardon with a  fellow Trump lawyer more than half a dozen times. He said the lawyer told him after he testified to Congress that Trump “heard that you did great, and don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine. He loves ya.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani himself also publicly floated pardons related to witnesses in the Russia investigation. He at one point  told the New York Daily News  that when “the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.” He  told CNN  around the same time that “When it’s over, hey, he’s the president of the United States. He retains his pardon power. Nobody is taking that away from him.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the comments of another lawyer who figured prominently in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, John Eastman.\n \n\n   \n  Just a few days after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Eastman  emailed Giuliani , saying, “I’ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works.”\n \n\n   \n  We still don’t know who was keeping such a “pardon list,” or why. But it signaled that those around Trump seemed to sense their actions were at least legally problematic and were preparing accordingly very shortly after January 6.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, some involved had either been  told their plans were illegal or acknowledged it  in the days and weeks beforehand, but they pressed forward anyway. Then they rather quickly seemed to start talking about pardons.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly five years later, Eastman has joined Giuliani in actually being on a Trump “pardon list.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-supreme-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:25:00-05:00","title":"Trump asks Supreme Court to overturn verdict that he sexually abused and defamed E.

Jean Carroll.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a federal appeals court affirmed the jury’s  verdict and $5 million judgment  against Trump, ruling the trial judge did not make errors that would warrant a new trial. In June, Trump  lost an effort   to have the appeal reviewed by the full bench of judges.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the civil trial, made numerous errors by allowing the jury to hear testimony from two women who alleged Trump sexually assaulted them years ago.\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers also said the judge should not have let the jurors see the  “Access Hollywood tape, ” which captured Trump in 2005 on a hot mic saying he gropes and kisses women.\n \n\n   \n  Carroll sued Trump alleging he sexually assaulted her in a New York department store in the mid-1990s and defamed her when in 2019 he denied the assault, said she wasn’t his type, and claimed she made it up to boost sales of a book.\n \n\n   \n  “There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation,” Trump told the Supreme Court in the appeal filed Monday viewed by CNN. “Instead, Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th president, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal has not yet been formally docketed at the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Supreme Court takes up the case is yet to be seen, but it likely won’t be the last time the justices are asked to review litigation involving Carroll.\n \n\n   \n  A different jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll for repeating his statements in 2022 and ordered him to pay $83 million in damages. A federal appeals court panel  affirmed the damages award  finding it “reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts” and rejected several of Trump’s legal challenges. Among them, the appeals court found that Trump had previously waived any claim of presidential immunity and said the Supreme Court’s decision last year involving criminal cases did not alter their view.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has asked for the full bench of judges to review the case. The Justice Department filed an amicus brief supporting review of whether presidential immunity can be waived “from civil damages liability predicated on official acts.”  Carroll’s response is due in the next few weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/baseball-mlb-announces-gambling-safeguards","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:50:00Z","title":"MLB Announces New Gambling Safeguards After Two Guardians Pitchers Indicted in Betting Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two Cleveland Guardians pitchers, Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, were indicted for allegedly rigging pitches to facilitate illegal sports betting, with prosecutors claiming they coordinated with corrupt bettors to place fraudulent wagers on specific pitch outcomes, resulting in over $400,000 in illegal profits.

Manfred, Jr.  said in a statement Monday that he commended “the industry for working with us to take action on a national solution to address the risks posed by these pitch-level markets, which are particularly vulnerable to integrity concerns.”\n \n\n   \n   Clase and Ortiz  face charges on multiple counts of wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, money laundering conspiracy and more, according to prosecutors on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Both Clase and Ortiz have maintained their innocence through their lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning,”   Ortiz’s   attorney Chris Georgalis told CNN in an email on Sunday. “Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s attorney, Michael J. Ferrara, also told CNN that his client is “innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Both players have been placed on non-disciplinary leave during the 2025 MLB season in relation to a sports betting probe.\n \n\n   \n  Ortiz appeared in federal court in Boston on Monday. According to the Associated Press, US Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell released Ortiz on a $500,000 bond, mandated that the 26-year-old relinquish   his passport, and restricted his travel to the local area, among other stipulations.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the court for details.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges “the defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators on specific pitches that they would throw in MLB games. The co-conspirators then used that information to place hundreds of fraudulent bets on those pitches.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s involvement in the scheme is alleged to have started in 2023. The three-time All-Star coordinated with corrupt sports bettors to rig proposition bets on particular pitches he would throw, prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The bettors would then wager on the speed and type of Clase’s pitches, based on information they received in advance from Clase, sometimes even during games, per the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ says bettors won at least $400,000 using inside information on Clase’s pitches.\n \n\n   \n  Ortiz is accused of joining the enterprise in 2025, working alongside Clase to coordinate with bettors on rigged pitches he would throw.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Ortiz was paid a total of $12,000 to intentionally throw a ball instead of a strike in two MLB games. Clase allegedly received matching payments for his role in helping to arrange Ortiz’s rigged pitches, the feds say, with gamblers winning at least $60,000 in the process.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment, which was filed on Wednesday and unsealed Sunday, comes on the heels of a series of  similar indictments  involving Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones.\n \n\n   \n  The trio was arrested in October in relation to two separate federal gambling investigations, one involving rigged high-stakes poker games and the other involving insider trading in sports betting.\n \n\n   \n  Both the MLB and NBA cases are being handled by Nocella’s Brooklyn office.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted of all charges, Clase and Ortiz could potentially face decades behind bars.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Amanda Musa contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/west-virginia-national-guard-dc-deployment-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00Z","title":"Judge Allows Continued Deployment of West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A judge in West Virginia ruled that the deployment of over 300 National Guard members from the state to Washington, D.C., is lawful under both state and federal law, despite a lawsuit by a civic group arguing it violated state statutes restricting out-of-state Guard deployment.

Lindsay made the ruling after hearing arguments in a lawsuit by a civic organization that argued Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey exceeded his authority when he authorized the Guard’s deployment in August.\n \n\n   \n  “The question before this court is whether or not state law allows West Virginia to do this,” Lindsay said. “The court has found that.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge added: “This court believes that the federal law allows for the request made by the president to the governor.”\n \n\n   \n   West Virginia is among several states  that sent National Guard members to the nation’s capital. While the state National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November, it is consulting with the governor’s office and others on the possibility of extending the stay.\n \n\n   \n  Formal orders were issued last week  extending the deployment  of the District of Columbia’s National Guard in the city through the end of February.\n \n\n   \n  “We are pleased with the judge’s decision,” Jace Goins, the state’s chief deputy attorney general, said outside the court in Charleston. “The National Guard are going nowhere.

The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a simple issue of a broad, lawful request by the president and a lawful deployment by the governor. That’s all,” Goins said.\n \n\n   \n  Aubrey Sparks, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s West Virginia chapter, said she didn’t believe it was the correct decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that West Virginia law is clear,” Sparks said. “I think what the state was permitted to do here is to skirt past West Virginia law simply because Trump asked them to. And that’s not how the law works. We remain deeply concerned about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, although the Department of Justice itself says violent crime there is at  a 30-year low .\n \n\n   \n  Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops  from eight states  and the District of Columbia were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command.

The author has said he wanted to write about a Hungarian immigrant, and “about life as a physical experience, about what it’s like to be a living body in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Accepting his trophy at London’s Old Billingsgate – a former fish market turned glitzy events venue – Szalay thanked the judges for rewarding his “risky” novel.\n \n\n   \n  He recalled asking his editor “whether she could imagine a novel called ‘Flesh’ winning the Booker Prize.”\n \n\n   \n  “You have your answer,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Doyle, who chaired the judges, said István belongs to a group overlooked in fiction: a working-class man. He said that since reading it, he looks more closely when he walks past bouncers standing in the doorways of Dublin pubs.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m kind of giving him a second look, because I feel I might know him a bit better,” said Doyle, whose funny, poignant stories of working-class Dublin life won him the 1993 Booker Prize for “Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha.”\n \n\n   \n  “It presents us with a certain type of man that invites us to look behind the face.”\n \n\n   \n  Szalay, who was born in Canada, raised in the UK and lives in Vienna, was previously a Booker finalist in 2016 for “All That Man Is,” a series of stories about nine wildly different men.\n \n\n   \n  “Flesh” was praised by many critics but frustrated others with its refusal to fill in the gaps in István’s story – great swathes of life, including incarceration and wartime service in Iraq occur off the page – and its stubbornly unexpressive central character, whose most common remark is “Okay.”\n \n\n   \n  “We loved the spareness of the writing,” Doyle said. “We loved how so much was revealed without us being overly aware that it was being revealed … Watching this man grow, age, and learning so much about him – despite him, in a way.\n \n\n   \n  “If the gaps were filled, it would be less of a book,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay was considered an outsider for this year’s prize but had been rising up bookmakers’ odds in the days before Monday’s ceremony.\n \n\n   \n  The front-runners according to betting markets were British writer Miller for early-1960s domestic drama “The Land in Winter” and Indian author Desai for globe-spanning saga “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” her first novel since “The Inheritance of Loss,” which won the Booker Prize in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  The other finalists were Susan Choi’s twisty family saga “Flashlight”; Katie Kitamura’s tale of acting and identity, “Audition”; and midlife-crisis road trip “The Rest of Our Lives” by Ben Markovits.\n \n\n   \n  The Booker Prize was founded in 1969 and has established a reputation for transforming writers’ careers. Its winners have included Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan, Arundhati Roy, Margaret Atwood and Samantha Harvey, who took the 2024 prize for space station story “Orbital.”\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/hannibal-gadhafi-released-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Hannibal Gadhafi, Son of Late Libyan Leader, Released by Lebanon After 10 Years in Detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hannibal Gadhafi, son of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, was released from Lebanese detention after 10 years, following a reduction in bail from $11 million to $900,000 and the lifting of a travel ban.

5:30 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Associated Press\n \n   \n  Lebanese authorities released the son of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Monday after he paid a $900,000 bail, ending his 10-year detention for allegedly withholding information about a missing Lebanese cleric, security officials and a member of his defense team said.\n \n\n   \n  One of  Hannibal Gadhafi ’s lawyers, Charbel Milad al-Khoury, told the Associated Press that Gadhafi was released Monday evening after necessary paperwork was finished. Two security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, also confirmed that Gadhafi was set free.\n \n\n   \n  “Hannibal is officially free and has the full right to choose the destination that he wants,” al-Khoury said. He refused to give further details about Gadhafi’s future movements out of security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  The release came days after Lebanese authorities lifted a travel ban and reduced the bail for Hannibal Gadhafi, paving the way for his release.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s decision by the country’s judicial authorities to lift the travel ban and reduce the bail from $11 million came days after a Libyan delegation visited Lebanon and made progress in talks for the release of Gadhafi.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-October, a Lebanese judge ordered Gadhafi’s release on $11 million bail, but banned him from traveling outside Lebanon. His lawyers said at the time that he didn’t have enough to pay that amount, and sought permission for him to leave the country.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, his bail was reduced to 80 billion Lebanese pounds (about $900,000) and the travel ban was lifted allowing him to leave the country once he pays the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The two judicial and one security official said the bail was paid by the Libyan delegation. The Justice Ministry of the Tripoli-based government also posted on its social media platforms that the Libyan delegation paid the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The judicial officials in Beirut said Gadhafi’s defense team withdrew a case against the Lebanese state that they had filed in Geneva last month over holding him without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Libya formally requested Hannibal Gadhafi’s release in 2023, citing his deteriorating health after he went on a hunger strike to protest his detention without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Detained in Lebanon in 2015, Gadhafi was accused of withholding information about the fate of Lebanese Shiite cleric Moussa al-Sadr who disappeared during a trip to Libya in 1978, although the late leader’s son was less than 3 years old at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Gadhafi had been living in exile in Syria with his Lebanese wife, Aline Skaf, and children until he was abducted in 2015 and brought to Lebanon by Lebanese militants who were demanding information about al-Sadr.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanese police later announced they had seized Gadhafi from the northeastern Lebanese city of Baalbek where he was being held, and he had been held ever since in a Beirut jail, where he faced questioning over al-Sadr’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. The cleric’s family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume he is dead. He would be 96 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sadr, who went missing with companions Abbas Badreddine and Mohammed Yacoub, was the founder of a Shiite political and military group that took part in the long Lebanese Civil War that began in 1975, largely pitting Muslims against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi was  killed by opposition fighters  during Libya’s 2011 uprising-turned-civil war, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.\n \n\n   \n  Hannibal Gadhafi, who was born nearly three years before al-Sadr disappeared, fled to Algeria after his father was toppled and Tripoli fell to opposition fighters, along with his mother and several other relatives. He later moved to Syria where he was given political asylum and stayed there until he was abducted.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi had eight children from two marriages. Most of them had significant roles in his government. His son Muatassim was killed at the same time as the leader was captured and slain. Two other sons, Saif al-Arab and Khamis, were killed in the uprising.\n \n\n   \n   Saif al-Islam , the one-time heir apparent to his father, has been in Libya since his release from detention there in 2017. Gadhafi’s son Mohammed and daughter Aisha live in Oman. Al-Saadi, a former soccer player, was released from prison in Libya in 2021 after being jailed following repatriation from Niger in 2014, and is believed to be living in Turkey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/americas/ecuador-prison-deaths-asphyxiation-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00-05:00","title":"At least 27 inmates killed by ‘asphyxiation’ in southern Ecuador in wave of prison violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of prison violence in southern Ecuador, specifically at the Machala Detention Center, resulted in at least 31 inmate deaths on November 10, 2025.

least 31 inmates dead on Sunday, including 27 who were killed by “asphyxiation,” officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In the first attack, the criminal group  Los Lobos  was targeted by a breakaway gang known as Sao-Box in the early morning, Interior Minister John Reimberg said Monday in an interview with Radio Centro Ecuador. At least four inmates in the Machala Detention Center were reported killed and roughly 36 were wounded. Two officers suffered nonserious injuries as authorities stepped in to regain control of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the day, Los Lobos carried out a “reprisal” attack against Sao-Box, killing 27 of its members by asphyxiating them inside several cells that both groups shared, according to Reimberg.\n \n\n   \n  “In retaliation, Lobos asphyxiated members of the other organization to avoid leaving signs of violence on their bodies,” the minister said.\n \n\n   \n  Prison guards discovered the bodies around 6 p.m. while carrying out routine inspections.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s penitentiary system SNAI said in a previous statement Sunday that the inmates had “committed asphyxiation among themselves, which resulted in immediate death by suspension.” Authorities did not immediately clarify what they meant by “asphyxiation” or say whether the inmates were hanged.\n \n\n   \n  In response to inquiries from the press, including CNN, SNAI said Sunday that “authorities, operational teams and forensic medical personnel continue working at the scene, verifying information and attending to reported emergencies.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked why rival gang members shared cells, Reimberg noted that they were initially part of the same group, before Sao-Box broke off from Los Lobos over management disputes. He did not specify why they were still kept in the same place after the split.\n \n\n   \n  The first attack on Sunday was prompted by the transfer of inmates to a new maximum-security facility, SNAI said without providing details.\n \n\n   \n  Reimberg suggested that inmates across the country have been causing chaos to prevent authorities from transferring them to the new prison.\n \n\n   \n  The attacks in Machala are the latest in a series of deadly prison clashes throughout Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n  In September, a confrontation between rival gangs at a prison in the coastal city of Esmeraldas left at least  17 dead , according to the National Police. Three days earlier, an additional 14 inmates were killed in Machala.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2021, more than 500 inmates have died in Ecuador’s prisons, according to official figures.\n \n\n   \n  The wave of prison violence is happening despite the deployment of military and police forces in several penitentiaries. It’s part of an ongoing state of internal armed conflict that the government declared in January 2024 to try to quell criminal violence nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  Los Lobos is one of two Ecuadorian criminal groups that the United States said it would designate as foreign terrorist organizations in September.

Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:02 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a year after his lightning power grab, Syria’s president is capping his transformation from jihadist to global statesman in a historic visit to the White House that says as much about the young leader as it does his push for his country’s diplomatic reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  Ahmed Al-Sharaa’s meeting on Monday – the first ever visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state – is his 20th foreign trip since appointing himself as president of  Syria  in January, and his second visit to the United States, following his attendance of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting was  ﻿ the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very strong leader,” US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following Monday’s visit, adding: “He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him. I get along with him … and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Trump has praised the Syrian leader. In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US extended its pause on most sanctions for another 180 days. However, the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington was to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al-Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump nodded to Al-Sharaa’s multilayered past on Monday, saying: “We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN last December, Al-Sharaa said he had gone through episodes of transformation through the years.  Using his nom de guerre , he said: “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s visit demonstrated that shift: Syria is expected to announce that it is joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, a senior Trump administration official said, making Syria the 90th member of the D-ISIS Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sharaa’s Syria will partner with the US “to eliminate ISIS remnants and halt foreign fighter flows,” the official said, adding that the visit is focused on “counterterrorism cooperation, economic development, and advancing regional peace and security.”\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, Al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Al-Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Fox, Jennifer Hansler, Dalia Abdelwahab, Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/lukoil-iraq-russia-sanctions-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:57:00Z","title":"Russian oil firm’s multibillion-dollar assets overseas at risk as US sanctions begin to bite","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US sanctions imposed by the US Treasury on Russian oil company Lukoil, following President Donald Trump’s announcement on October 22, 2025, have severely disrupted Lukoil’s operations.

Iraqi government says it can no longer work with  Russian  oil company Lukoil – which has a huge stake in the country’s oil fields – because of recently imposed US sanctions against the company.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil has told Iraq’s state oil company SOMO that it is declaring force majeure – citing circumstances beyond its control for its inability to fulfill its contract – according to Oil Ministry spokesman Abdul Sahib Bazoun al-Hasnawi.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil has a 75% stake in the giant West Qurna-2 field in southern Iraq, which produces more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil a day. Overall, its overseas assets are valued at more than $20 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hasnawi told CNN that Lukoil was unable to pay the salaries of hundreds of employees, most of them Iraqis, due to the  sanctions announced  by US President Donald Trump on October 22.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Lukoil for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil failed in its bid to sell its overseas operations to an Austrian-based company last week after the US Treasury intervened to block the move and its global assets are now at risk, according to industry analysts.\n \n\n   \n  Companies operating in Iraq “must be completely free from any operations, suspicions, or sanctions that may be issued … by the US Treasury or even the European Union,” according to Ali Nizar al-Shatari, director general of Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization known as SOMO.\n \n\n   \n  “All payments for exported oil and petroleum products are processed through the SWIFT (international transactions) system, which prohibits participation by sanctioned or high-risk entities,” al-Shatari said in a video statement last week.\n \n\n   \n  SOMO has suspended crude oil payments owed to Lukoil for the month of November – estimated at around four million barrels.\n \n\n   \n  “Lukoil’s dues remain frozen until a compliant payment mechanism is established,” al-Shatari said.\n \n\n   \n  Industry analysts say that several Lukoil shipments from Iraq were scheduled for this month.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil had tried to sell its overseas assets to Gunvor, a Swiss-based oil trader, but withdrew its bid after the US Treasury said it would “never” grant Gunvor a license to operate the assets.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil  said  on October 30 that it had accepted an offer from Gunvor to buy its subsidiary  Lukoil International GmbH, which owns the international assets of Lukoil Group.\n \n\n   \n  But last Thursday, the US Treasury said in a post on X that “as long as (Russian President Vladimir) Putin continues the senseless killings (in Russia’s  war on Ukraine ), the Kremlin’s puppet, Gunvor, will never get a license to operate and profit.”\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil International has a 5% stake in the Chevron-operated Tengiz oil development in Kazakhstan, as well as refineries in Romania and Bulgaria and a global trading operation controlled by a Swiss-based subsidiary.\n \n\n   \n  The Bulgarian authorities have tightened security around the Lukoil refinery in Burgas, according to state media, while the government drafts legislation that will allow it to take control of the refinery and sell it to a new owner to protect the plant from US sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  Last week the Finnish service station chain Teboil, also owned by Lukoil, was running out of fuel as sanctions against the parent company prevented it from doing business.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Finnish energy firm Neste suspended fuel deliveries to Teboil following the US measures against Lukoil.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/football-nfl-new-york-giants-fire-brian-daboll","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:05:00Z","title":"New York Giants fire head coach Brian Daboll","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The New York Giants have fired head coach Brian Daboll following a 2-8 start to the 2025 NFL season and a 24-20 loss to the Chicago Bears.

\nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling Friday  limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Friday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00-05:00","title":"Canada loses its measles elimination status amid large outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after sustained transmission of the same measles virus strain continued for over a year, beginning in October 2024.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Canada has lost its measles elimination status amid a large ongoing outbreak of the virus, the Public Health Agency of Canada said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Canada’s health agency was informed by the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, that it had lost its measles elimination status as viral transmission has continued uninterrupted since October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Although it has slowed recently, according to the Canadian government, the outbreak is still ongoing, primarily within undervaccinated communities.\n \n\n   \n  “PAHO’s Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission reviewed recent epidemiological and laboratory data, confirming sustained transmission of the same measles virus strain in Canada for a period of more than one year,” officials said in a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The Re-Verification Commission, or RVC, is an independent body of experts created by the Pan American Health Organization to analyze data and the current measles outbreak situation. The group met at the beginning of November and made its recommendations to the PAHO director, who makes the ultimate decision about Canada’s status.\n \n\n   \n  Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the virus strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months, the Public Health Agency of Canada  said on its website.  The agency said it is working with PAHO and local public health leaders to slow the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Canada  had been considered measles-free since 1998.  A measles vaccine was first approved to be used in Canada in 1963, and various vaccination campaigns were successful. But in more recent years, vaccine hesitancy has grown, and vaccination rates fell below the target of 95% coverage for all recommended childhood vaccines,  research shows .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said Monday. “This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible.”\n \n\n   \n  However, with the change in Canada’s status, the Americas region officially loses its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  There are no formal consequences to losing such status. But until measles is eliminated worldwide, countries will face the risk of reintroduction and the spread of the virus, Barbosa said. The virus is so contagious that one infected person can transmit the disease to up to 18 others.\n \n\n   \n  As of last month, Canada had tallied more than 5,000 cases for the year — more than twice as many as the country has recorded in the past 25 years combined.\n \n\n   \n  The US has also seen large outbreaks this year and is on the verge of losing its elimination status.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that the US is going to stop the transmission even before that deadline,” said Dr. Daniel Salas, executive manager of PAHO’s Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s large US measles outbreak started in West Texas in January. It’s been declared over, but there is an investigation into whether a growing outbreak along the Arizona-Utah state line could be connected. Cases and outbreaks have also been reported in other states.\n \n\n   \n  “We are supporting all the actions that the US has been taking to actually control the outbreak to stop them,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico also has a recent outbreak, Salas said, concentrated mostly in Chihuahua, but there are also cases in Mexico’s southern states.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely, they need to continue vaccinating,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  With hard work, Barbosa said, he believes that Canada can regain its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have demonstrated before with political commitment regional cooperation and sustain the vaccination, the region can once again interrupt the transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/media/bbc-trump-edit-lawsuit-turness-davie-media","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:04:00Z","title":"Trump threatens to sue BBC as broadcaster faces 'fight for its survival'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC is in the midst of a political and reputational crisis after a misleading edit in a one-year-old documentary about Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, which falsely suggested he called for violent action during his January 6 speech.

EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC is embroiled in a massive political fight over its future, with conservatives capitalizing on  an editing screw-up  and denouncing the British broadcaster while liberals argue that the institution is flawed but worth defending.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump intensified the pressure by sending a threatening legal letter to the news organization over the misleading edit in a one-year-old documentary about his reelection campaign. He is demanding at least $1 billion in damages.\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson told CNN that “we will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has sent several legal letters to other news organizations, including CNN, during his second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s legal threats often don’t amount to anything, but he does have pending lawsuits against the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Des Moines Register.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah issued a belated apology for the “error of judgment” with the October 2024 documentary. BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness tendered their resignations on Sunday as stories about the edit scandal consumed British media.\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the misleading edit was politically motivated. Nor is there any reason to believe that Davie and Turness knew about it ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  However, a lawyer for Trump asserted Monday that the BBC defamed the president “by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter, obtained by CNN, charges the broadcaster with defamation and claims that Trump has suffered “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” despite no one seeming to call out the error at the time of the broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, The Telegraph, a longtime source of anti-BBC commentary, wrote about an “internal report” revealing the bad edit, and the story has since snowballed.\n \n\n   \n  The pre-election film spliced together different parts of Trump’s infamous January 6 speech at the Ellipse to make it sound like Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  In a contrite letter to the head of a parliamentary committee on Monday, Shah said the BBC accepted that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We are not perfect’\n \n\n   \n  The revelation about the misleading edit has contributed to an ongoing political fight over the BBC’s funding and future, with conservatives using the error as a new opportunity to denounce the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack,” BBC veteran John Simpson wrote on X Sunday night. He praised Davie and Turness and said, “We’ve now got a real fight on our hands to defend public service broadcasting, because that’s under threat too.”\n \n\n   \n  This is ultimately all about trust: Who trusts the BBC, who doesn’t, and why.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s adversaries, including politicians who detest its news coverage and media moguls who want to take its market share, say the BBC has lost trust, perhaps permanently.\n \n\n   \n  They cite a wide range of perceived wrongs. Former conservative party leader Liz Truss, who had a brief term as prime minister in 2022, wrote on Sunday, “I’m glad the US President and the rest of the world are seeing the BBC for what it is. failure to tell the truth on everything from transgender ideology to economics to Gaza has done huge damage to politics and government in this country. This should be the end of nationalised broadcasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Conservative activists in the UK have long railed against the license fee that British households pay for BBC programs and services. The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, including the license fee structure, ahead of the current charter’s expiration at the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  That review presents an opening for the BBC’s many critics to demand changes — at the same time, the BBC is trying to establish new revenue streams and transform itself for the digital age.\n \n\n   \n  Last week’s story in The Telegraph was based on a lengthy memo by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines. Prescott’s memo warned the BBC board about what he called serious problems with news coverage and “inaction” by the broadcaster’s leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary was his first example, but he also cited concerns about coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, gender identity, racial diversity and other matters. He argued that “errors are repeated time and time again.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah responded on Monday and said the BBC has “published corrections where we have got things wrong; changed editorial guidance to make the BBC’s position on issues clearer; made changes to leadership where the problems point to underlying issues; and carried out formal disciplinary measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah also urged people to keep “a sense of perspective,” pointing to “thousands of hours of outstanding journalism” by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  But a sense of perspective is usually the first thing lost in a media feeding frenzy. Veteran British journalist Alan Rusbridger wrote Monday that the BBC now finds itself “in a fight for its survival.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary error was “serious,” Rusbridger wrote, but the BBC’s enemies want to see the entire organization “wither or die,” which “would leave us all far worse off.”\n \n\n   \n  Robert Shrimsley, UK chief political commentator and executive editor of the Financial Times, said on X that it’s important to recognize the political dimensions of the dispute.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that the BBC has made serious culpable errors does not negate the point that there is a real and concerted right-wing media campaign to destroy it,” Shrimsley said. “Both points can be true at the same time and the campaign would not end even if the errors did.”\n \n\n   \n  After reading all the press about the scandal from Kyiv, where he is on assignment, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale took to social media and expressed his pride in the organization.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not perfect; we must always strive to be better,” he wrote Monday. “But in a darkening world, we remain a shaft of light.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:26:00Z","title":"Women face a much higher risk of homicide, especially from guns, during pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the United States face a significantly higher risk of homicide, especially from firearms, as shown by a study published in JAMA Network Open that analyzed over 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 and 2021.

Her youngest daughter, Francesca Harris-Scarborough, had been killed the night before.\n \n\n   \n  Police had found the 31-year-old’s car still idling. Scarborough’s daughter, who was three months pregnant, had been shot twice in the heart.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t ready for it. I lost control of everything,” Scarborough said. “Everything went blank.”\n \n\n   \n  Francesca was part of a terrible trend in the United States: Homicide is the No. 1 way pregnant women die,  research  has  showed , but a new  study  finds that they are even more vulnerable than other women of childbearing age when there’s a gun involved.\n \n\n   \n  The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at more than 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 and 2021. Pregnant women were found to have a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than women who weren’t pregnant, and more than two-thirds of pregnancy-associated homicides involved firearms.\n \n\n   \n  The presence of a firearm is known to be a key risk factor of intimate partner homicide. The new study showed that every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership was associated with a 6% increase in all-cause homicide and an 8% increase in the firearm-specific homicide rate in pregnant women, even after adjusting for other factors.\n \n\n   \n  “Even incremental increases in firearm availability may contribute to measurable increases in homicide risk in pregnant women,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really not surprising, if you think about it, that if firearms are more available, then that certainly it does increase your risk of homicide in general,” said study co-author Dr. Lois Lee, a senior faculty adviser in the Office and Health Equity & Inclusion and an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. “So you could imagine, if you take away or at least decrease the number of firearms, then there would likely be many fewer deaths during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  “And unlike medical conditions, which, yes, we do have many medical advances and can save many lives, but in some ways, those conditions are much less preventable, like eclampsia and sepsis,” Lee added. “This is predictable and potentially preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The highest proportion of homicides in pregnant women was among those 20 to 24 years old. Among women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicide victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors recommend safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Although most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books, said Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, who was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually, the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow-up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multidisciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement and court administrators who serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit. It scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm.\n \n\n   \n  According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughter’s journals after her death, Scarborough said, she realized that although her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that began when she was younger. Scarborough also started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Scarborough hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die. We can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher. It’s changed my life. It will never be the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Black Box Safety Warning to Be Removed from Hormone Therapy for Menopause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is removing the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause, a move driven by updated scientific evidence showing that early initiation of therapy—before age 60 or within 10 years of menopause—can safely reduce risks of heart disease, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline, while effectively managing debilitating symptoms.

Some women still face some risks from hormone therapy, including those at increased risk of blood clots or who have previously had breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n  But for many women, the benefits may far outweigh the risks.\n \n\n   \n  “With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there’s no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,” Makary  posted on X  Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  It could take months for the labels to change, but drugmakers are “very excited” to make the update, Makary said.  Label changes  will include updated guidance that hormones should be initiated in women who are younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause to optimize benefits and risks, and removal of guidance to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time — clearing the way for women to stay on the treatments for years.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors, and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s health experts praised the move to update the boxed warning to reflect newer scientific evidence around menopausal hormone therapy but said individualized discussions of risks and benefits will still be needed.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a past president of the Menopause Society, said the labeling change was overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “As a bottom line, I think given more than 20 years of class-wide labeling of hormone therapy, it is time to get the labeling right, and some of these changes that are proposed are very well-supported. Others may be controversial, but overall, it is a step in the right direction,” said Manson, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study that spurred the initial label change.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, this box warning is a one-size-fits-all summary that hormone therapy increases the risk of all these conditions,” Manson said. “It doesn’t take into account whether it’s local estrogen or systemic estrogen, the age of the woman, the type of the formulation.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said she is among many doctors who advocated for label changes for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Removing the scary boxed warning from local vaginal estrogen is a victory for women’s health and for those who care for and about menopausal women,” Pinkerton said in a statement. “Regarding the removal of the boxed warning for systemic hormone therapy, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and has systemic effects throughout the body, we appreciate the FDA’s thoughtful, nuanced approach. Discussions will be more complicated and need to be individualized, as different menopause therapies differ in potential risks.”\n \n\n   \n    What changed around hormone therapy\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of  menopause treatments  that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warned about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning, or boxed warning, was added after  a large government-funded study , the Women’s Health Initiative, found in 2002 that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had some higher health risks compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.\n \n\n   \n  After the study and the label change, doctors became reluctant to prescribe them, and prescriptions for hormone therapy for menopause dropped by more than 70%. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25,  one study found .\n \n\n   \n  The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a total horrible tragedy that so many millions of women have been deprived,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the books “ Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You ” and “ The New Hormone Solution .”\n \n\n   \n  “Hormone therapy is important because for about 10 to 15 years before you go into menopause, your hormones start leaving you. As your hormones start leaving you, you need more hormones. And you don’t need hormone replacement; you need hormone supplementation,” Schwartz said.\n \n\n   \n  “Chronic illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis, cancer, they are diseases of aging, and one reason is the loss of hormones.”\n \n\n   \n  More recent analyses of the Women’s Health Initiative,  as early as 2010 , have since shown that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, can more safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “To this day, I still have patients coming in telling me their obstetricians or gynecologists have said to them they shouldn’t be taking hormones, because they’re going to get cancer. And not only will they not get cancer, the hormones will protect them from cancer,” Schwartz said. “We have the data.”\n \n\n   \n  In July, the FDA convened a panel of experts to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Makary  told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta  in an episode of the “Chasing Life” podcast that the agency was in “serious discussions” about what to do with the black box warning.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really a tragedy. It’s maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”\n \n\n   \n    Changing views on menopause\n \n\n   \n  The FDA action follows a wave of policies introduced across the country to improve menopause care at the state level. Most of the legislation has been related to insurance   coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace.\n \n\n   \n  “When we think about the timing of this announcement, it’s not just the FDA making a move. It comes in the good company of now 19 states, red and blue alike, introducing more than 35 bills to improve menopause care,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Center at the  New York University School of Law , who has been tracking menopause legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “All these things are happening at the same time, and that’s in part because there is a loud and proud movement making these demands now, insisting that menopause care be equitable and treatments accessible, that menopause no longer be in the shadows and that we not be subject to misinformation,” said Weiss-Wolf, author of the forthcoming book, “When In Menopause: A User’s Manual and Citizens Guide.”\n \n\n   \n  The removal of the warning on hormone for menopause has long been in the making, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Back in 2014, the Menopause Society and other leading menopause experts had actually started  a petition to the FDA  to remove the label,” Weiss-Wolf said. “This is something that the menopause medical community has been asking for.”\n \n\n   \n  The action will change the landscape of care to make hormone therapy, especially estrogen, more accessible for midlife women, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, an Atlanta-based cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs at Hello Heart, an app that specializes in women’s health and cardiovascular research.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact of the matter is, estrogen is one of the primary drivers of the heart. There are estrogen receptors on the heart, on the brain, in the bones, so it’s like the fuel that drives our body. Once that fuel runs out, it’s just like a car, the car begins to sputter,” Morgan said.\n \n\n   \n  “Women live about  six years longer  than men, but we spend about 25% of our lives in lower quality of life,” she said. “That’s where hormone therapy can help.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/visa-mastercard-deal-merchant-fees","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:47:00-05:00","title":"Visa and Mastercard Propose Deal to Lower Merchant Fees, Threatening Consumer Rewards","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement to reduce interchange fees by 0.1% over five years, offering merchants more flexibility, including the option to add surcharges or refuse premium credit cards.

In 2024,  over a third  of all purchases were made with credit cards and those who use them might face new surcharges when they swipe or have to use another form of payment if businesses don’t accept their card.\n \n\n   \n  And because credit card companies finance credit card rewards, lower interchange fees may mean fewer perks. “If you were to lower interchange fees, you probably have to also lower rewards,” Joanna Stavins, principal economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston told CNN last month. That’s because “rewards are financed by interchange fees.”\n \n\n   \n  The two credit card giants have been entangled in a lawsuit brought by retailers for the last 20 years that alleged the companies have fixed the price of interchange fees — a large portion of the fees merchants pay when a customer makes a purchase with a credit card.

Brodie  rejected  the $30 billion proposal.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal announced this morning would see the two companies bring down interchange fees by 0.1% over the next five years, give merchants the choice to add surcharges when customers pay with credit cards as well as the option to refuse premium cards, which often charge substantially  higher fees .\n \n\n   \n  “After more than 20 years of litigation, Visa and Mastercard have reached a proposed settlement with U.S. merchants of all sizes that would provide meaningful relief, more flexibility and options to control how they accept payments from their customers,” Visa told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mastercard said that “smaller merchants will gain in this settlement – more acceptance choices, reduced costs and simplified rules.”\n \n\n   \n  The proposal from Visa and Mastercard specifically states that the deal is not an admission of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The National Retail Federation, a powerful trade group representing retailers, called the proposal “ window dressing .” A press release issued in response to reports of the proposal said the reduction in interchange fees doesn’t go far enough to address the rise in interchange fees, which they say average around 2.35%.\n \n\n   \n  The European Union capped credit card interchange fees at 0.3% in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that they believe the proposal from Visa and Mastercard, which has accumulated widespread opposition from retailers, is unlikely to be enacted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s remarkable that anyone could think a temporary 10 basis point reduction — barely more than last year’s increase — is fair compensation for allowing a credit card duopoly to maintain their pricing cartel for eight more years,” said the National Restaurant Federation.\n \n\n   \n  “If the courts can’t fix this, it’s time for Congress to take action,” said the National Retail Federation’s General Counsel Stephanie Martz.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/nicolas-sarkozy-released-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-05:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Released from Prison Pending Appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from prison pending an appeal after a Paris court ruled he could be freed under judicial control.

My energy is focused solely on the single goal of proving my innocence,” Sarkozy said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Monday, before his release, Sarkozy addressed a court hearing via videolink, he said that his 20 days in prison had been, “very hard.”\n \n\n   \n  He paid tribute to prison staff during his hearing Monday, adding that they had, “an exceptional humanity which made this nightmare bearable.”\n \n\n   \n  According to French magazine Le Point, Sarkozy had refused to eat anything except yogurts during his nearly three-week stint behind bars, reportedly due to fear other prisoners might spit in his food.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors requested Sarkozy be released under judicial control, with restrictions on whom he can contact.\n \n\n   \n  The court ruled that the former head of state will be forbidden from leaving France.\n \n\n   \n  The court also specified that Sarkozy is forbidden from contacting people implicated in his case as well as the current French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, who came under public scrutiny for visiting Sarkozy in prison in October, according to BFMTV.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement posted to X  shortly before Sarkozy set off for prison on October 21, Sarkozy stressed that he was an “innocent man.” Upon his conviction, he railed against the decision to find him guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “If they absolutely want me to sleep in prison, I will sleep in prison.

But it looks as though enough Democrats have given up on demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits and have accepted much more modest concessions.\n \n\n   \n  So how did this happen? What did we learn? And where do we go from here?\n \n\n   \n  Here are some takeaways from the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n    1. Democrats caved, full stop\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic Party isn’t leaving this process with nothing. They got a couple of significant concessions.\n \n\n   \n  One is a commitment to hold a Senate vote on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies by next month — a vote that could apply real political pressure on Republicans. Democrats also got Republicans to agree to undo President Donald Trump’s attempts to lay off thousands of federal workers and to block any other such efforts through January.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s no question Democrats are the ones who folded, and somewhat curiously so.\n \n\n   \n  Virtually every poll showed them winning the blame game. They were fighting for something — an extension of the subsides — that those polls showed more than 7 in 10 Americans wanted. About  half of Americans wanted Democrats  to hold the line — something we just haven’t seen in recent shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats could seemingly have drawn this out and forced the issue. But they didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on [the Obamacare tax credits] becoming any more likely?” said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and who voted to advance the deal. “It appears not.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s certainly disputable. What’s not disputable is that a handful of more moderate Democrats lost their nerve.\n \n\n   \n    2. Democrats face a new reckoning — at a really bad time\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps King and Democrats like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  who threw in the towel  were right. Perhaps Democrats never would have won their main concession, and the shutdown would’ve gotten much uglier for the country in the days and weeks ahead — and unnecessarily so.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps worsening travel delays and Americans going hungry amid the legal fight over food stamps would ultimately have cost Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll likely never know.\n \n\n   \n  But what’s clear is that this cave came at a bad time for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It was finally looking like the party had some unity, purpose and wind at their backs after a year of being riven and lost in the wilderness. Some polling suggested Democratic voters, whose dim views of their party rendered it more unpopular than it’s been in decades, were  warming to their party’s brand again . The election results last week, following millions of people turning out to protest Trump at  “No Kings” demonstrations  last month, were especially encouraging for the party.\n \n\n   \n  But now Democrats will endure recriminations over whether the party truly has the stomach to fight Trumpism. The lawmakers who’ve advanced this deal appear to be in for some real vitriol from the base, and it’s likely to renew efforts to cast aside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in some ways seem to be in a similar position to where the GOP was last decade, when a large portion of the party wanted to fight harder, but the more moderate and institutional ranks ultimately stood in the way of a bolder approach.\n \n\n   \n  None of which means this will sink Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. History suggests this shutdown will be a distant memory by then. Anybody who cares that much about the shutdown is probably a nailed-on Democratic voter anyway. And this issue could eventually redound to their benefit (for reasons we’ll get to).\n \n\n   \n  But it does complicate things internally right now.\n \n\n   \n    3. Trump’s hostage-taking worked\n \n\n   \n  One of the more frustrating aspects for the Democratic base will be how this ended.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just that Democrats decided to give in; it’s that they did so in a way that appeared to reward Trump for heavy-handed tactics — again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has in recent days ratcheted up the pressure points. It has fought in court to  avoid paying full SNAP benefits . And it has  reduced traffic at dozens of major airports , leading to  hundreds of canceled flights . (The administration said this move was about safety, but critics wagered it was  more about leverage .) Trump has also pushed the GOP to scrap the filibuster in ways that didn’t seem likely to go anywhere but might have concerned more institutionally minded Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes after Trump explicitly targeted what he called “Democrat programs” with layoffs and funding cuts.\n \n\n   \n  This is a familiar tale by now. Trump has proved plenty willing to reach for all available leverage at his disposal, often violating political norms and possibly even the law in the process.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s worked for him. Institutions including colleges, law firms and media companies have repeatedly folded rather than fight Trump on these things, even when it appeared they had the upper hand. And that surely emboldens him.\n \n\n   \n  “Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” King said Monday morning on MSNBC, “it actually gave him more power.”\n \n\n   \n  Expect plenty of Democrats to pull their hair out over that quote.\n \n\n   \n    4. Trump’s hubris was on full display\n \n\n   \n  The flip side of Trump’s approach, though, was that it betrayed some remarkable hubris.\n \n\n   \n  Just consider all that happened over the last six weeks — and how little care he took to mind the optics.\n \n\n   \n  The administration repeatedly fought to avoid paying full SNAP benefits. That provided lawmaking leverage, yes, but it also risked making it look like it  wanted  to use poor people and their hunger as leverage. The president attended  a “Great Gatsby”-themed party  at his Mar-a-Lago resort the night before Americans were due to start losing those SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House to build a $350 million ballroom that polls show the American people  are pretty skeptical of .\n \n\n   \n  He extensively promoted a  very marbled renovation  of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s efforts to gild the White House seemed to  continue apace .\n \n\n   \n  These are all pretty questionable moves, given not just the shutdown but also a series of troubling economic signs. But Trump, who’s taken to talking about  “affordability”  of late, seems unperturbed by how it might look.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, his approval rating has  plumbed new depths   over the past two weeks .\n \n\n   \n    5. Republicans still have an Obamacare problem — and this could exacerbate it\n \n\n   \n  The best case for Democrats’ strategy is this: They were never going to get Trump and GOP leaders to commit to extending the Obamacare tax credits as part of a shutdown deal. But they could force an issue that’s a significant GOP liability, cast a spotlight on it and even force Republicans to take some tough votes and squirm a little.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of whether that was actually the best Democrats could do, the pressure being applied on the GOP on health care isn’t insignificant.\n \n\n   \n  With around three-quarters of Americans supporting the tax credits, this issue poses very real political problems for Republicans. A recent Pew Research Center poll also showed  health care was the GOP’s worst issue  among a dozen tested, with 42% favoring the Democratic Party’s approach, compared with just 29% for Republicans’.\n \n\n   \n  Look at none other than  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia pleading with her party to renew these tax credits. Or the July  memo authored by Trump’s own pollster , Tony Fabrizio, making the case that letting the subsidies lapse could spell political disaster for the GOP in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, this record-long shutdown could spotlight the choice Republicans are about to make. By voting for a deal that does not extend the subsidies and therefore allows premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans, Republicans will have made it clearer that this is what they fought hard for. They’ll be put on the record on the issue in an even starker way when the Senate takes a separate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  If that measure were somehow to pass, it could pressure Speaker Mike Johnson to allow a vote in the House too.\n \n\n   \n  (Johnson did not take questions at a news conference Monday morning, but he has previously declined to promise such a vote, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune has pledged.)\n \n\n   \n  While Democrats want these tax credits extended from a policy standpoint, you could argue that the best thing for them from a raw-politics standpoint is for Republicans to reject them — and for voters to remember it come 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are already having to deal with explaining the  major Medicaid cuts in Trump’s big agenda bill  over the summer. And unlike those cuts, which are delayed until after the 2026 midterms, these premium increases will go into effect quickly.\n \n\n   \n  At the very least, Democrats have continued to fertilize a potent political argument on bad issue for the GOP.\n \n\n   \n    6. Maybe shutdowns can actually work?\n \n\n   \n  Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell often says shutdowns simply don’t work. He said in 2023 that they “never have produced a policy change and they’ve always been a loser for Republicans, politically.”\n \n\n   \n  This shutdown should challenge that conventional wisdom.\n \n\n   \n  No, Democrats didn’t get all or even most of what they wanted. But their ability to largely win the blame game suggests future shutdowns could be successfully leveraged, if the party forcing them plays its cards right.\n \n\n   \n  The big problem with the GOP’s shutdown strategies last decade seemed to be that the things they were shutting the government down over — defunding Obamacare and building a border wall — just weren’t that popular.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats showed that if you push for something that enough people favor, you might have a shot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-pardon-allies-2020-election-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:57:00-05:00","title":"Trump pardons Rudy Giuliani, others involved in efforts to overturn 2020 election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major move during his second term, President Donald Trump has issued a broad pardon to dozens of allies and political figures involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Mark Meadows, Jeffrey Clark, and others.

Those efforts culminated in the violent riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. One of his first official acts in his second term was to pardon over 1,000 people who were charged or convicted in the January 6 ​attack.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential pardons only apply to federal charges, not state or local charges. None of the people on the list are currently charged with federal crimes, though some were named as unindicted co-conspirators in special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case against Trump, which prosecutors withdrew after Trump’s 2024 election victory.\n \n\n   \n  However, state-level criminal charges are still pending against Giuliani, Meadows, many of the 2020 fake electors, and others on the pardon list. (They deny wrongdoing.) These 2020-related state prosecutions are ongoing in Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. These figures will likely try to use the pardon to aid their defense, though a presidential pardon doesn’t cover state crimes.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon also explicitly states that it does not apply to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon covers Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official in 2020 who  tried to weaponize   the department’s powers to overturn the election. (Clark is now a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.) Like Giuliani and Powell, Clark was an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal 2020-related indictment against Trump,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Clark said in  an X post  Monday that Trump had called him on Friday to inform him about the pardon. He said that he never asked for a pardon, defended his actions in 2020, and thanked Trump. But he also acknowledged the limits of clemency action.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good — a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others,” Clark wrote. “Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell and Giuliani, both of whom served as Trump’s personal lawyers, were at the center of the sprawling conspiracy theories which baselessly claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. Giuliani  played a leading role  in the “fake electors” scheme which sought to block then-President-elect Joe Biden from taking office by presenting certificates from battleground states which falsely said Trump won the election, during the Congressional counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said in a statement that the former New York City mayor “stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election,” adding that he “never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump’s decision.”\n \n\n   \n  Two of the architects of the fake electors scheme — lawyers  Ken Chesebro  and John Eastman — were also pardoned.

\nUpdated: \n        1:23 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court appeared unconvinced Monday that a  devout Rastafarian whose dreadlocks  were forcibly cut in prison five years ago should be able to sue correction officials for damages.\n \n\n   \n  Damon Landor had a few weeks left in his sentence for drug possession when guards at a Louisiana prison handcuffed him to a chair and shaved off the knee-length dreadlocks he had grown over nearly two decades. Minutes earlier, Landor had handed them a judicial opinion requiring prisons to allow dreadlocks for religious purposes.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, the case appeared tailor-made for a conservative Supreme Court that has consistently sided with religious interests in recent years. But over the course of nearly two hours of argument, it became clear that the conservative wing is far more concerned with allowing people to sue individual state officials as a way to  enforce federal spending laws .\n \n\n   \n  That’s largely because, several justices suggested, those individual state employees were not likely aware of the agreements states had made in exchange for federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, the facts of this case are egregious,” said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing. But, she said, “we can’t decide a case just based on these facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative who is among the court’s most ardent supporters of religious rights, suggested that under Landor’s theory, a cisgender woman trying out for a sports team on a college campus that receives federal funding could sue a coach personally for $1 million in damages for allowing a transgender woman onto that team.\n \n\n   \n  It was a notable question in part because the court is expected in coming weeks to hear arguments on whether states may ban transgender athletes from competing on teams consistent with their gender identity.\n \n\n   \n  “As I understand it,” Gorsuch said, the federal appeals courts “are unanimously against you and have been for many, many, many years.”\n \n\n   \n  A panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled that Landor was not entitled to sue  under a 25-year-old law intended to protect prisoners’ religious interests.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative New Orleans-based 5th Circuit said that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit ultimately  decided against  rehearing the case.\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had previously taken a promise known as the Nazarite vow to not cut his hair.\n \n\n   \n  He was incarcerated without incident at two other facilities before he was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center with only a few weeks left in his sentence. And he came armed with a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s case at the Supreme Court rests on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. Congress passed that law, and another that dealt with religious accommodation more widely, in response to a landmark but controversial 1990 precedent from the court. Five years ago, the  justices ruled that the other law , which has nearly identical language, does allow people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.\n \n\n   \n  But Louisiana countered that RLUIPA is effectively a spending contract between the federal government, which provides funding for state prisons, and state officials. The individual officials involved in Landor’s forced shaving were not a party to that contract, Louisiana said, so they can’t be held personally liable.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Justice John Roberts said Landor’s argument that state employees had received notice rested on a “legal fiction.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think when the prison guard is hired, he says, ‘well, I want to see the federal conditions that you agreed to under the contract,’” Roberts said.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s three-justice liberal wing saved most of its toughest questions for Louisiana’s attorney.\n \n\n   \n  The court is likely to hand down a decision in the case next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:44:00-05:00","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest US airports, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warning that cancellations could rise to 15–20% if the shutdown continues.

Of course, the pain is what you order by coming on Hot Ones, the beloved hot wings YouTube show.\n \n\n   \n  Once it was over, Harrelson still coughing, admitted to  host Sean Evans , “You nearly killed me, dude … and I say that with all due respect, because I know you nearly kill people on the daily.”\n \n\n   \n  Harrelson said that he never thought he’d do the show because he used to think he didn’t have what it took to get to the end of the  poultry gauntlet . “And now, here we are,” he said, victorious.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, while proclaimed in jest, captures a current appetite among many celebrities and fans alike to break away from conventional interviews in favor of more authentic and flavorful content.\n \n\n   \n  And what else like breaking bread – or chicken wings or, you know,  yeast extract  – has the ability to break that artifice, foster trust and entice celebrities to lower their guards for a playful exchange to which audiences can relate.\n \n\n   \n  “The hardest part of the interview is penetrating all of that artifice to get something real,” Evans told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  Ollie Kendal, one-half of the food content creator duo, JOLLY, put it even more succinctly in a separate conversation with CNN: “It’s the language everyone speaks: Food…Everyone’s got to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  And trust that people eat up the chance to see Gordon Ramsey serenade Evans with his trademark colorful language while chugging bubblegum-pink stomach soother on what has become Hot Ones’ most watched episode, or John Cena stoically brave the potent musk of British Black pudding (blood sausage) with JOLLY as he declares it a sign of sophistication.\n \n\n   \n  Hot Ones, JOLLY and Amelia Dimoldenberg’s  Chicken Shop Date  – with billions of combined total views and tens of millions of subscribers – are some of the most visible examples of the genre’s popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Many descendants have followed, including traditional media companies that are still trying to find new spins on the concept. (See: The NYT’s launch of “The Pizza Interview,” which asks press-touring celebrities to toss some dough while trying not to get their likely borrowed outfits covered in sauce.)\n \n\n   \n  In what is arguably the boom of the feed-the-famous frenzy, a natural question has emerged: Is it reaching the point of being bloated or is there more to feast on?\n \n\n   \n    Spicing up the press tour\n \n\n   \n  Food’s place within entertainment has never been a gimmick. In fact, it’s an interviewing tradition that dates back decades and has taken many forms.\n \n\n   \n  Jessa Moore, a media specialist with experience in food and tech, points out that culinary hosts like Martha Stewart and Ina Garten have featured celebrities on their shows since the nineties and early aughts. Even  I Love to Eat , the first network TV cooking show to air in the US back in 1946, featured famous designer and actress, Elsie de Wolfe.\n \n\n   \n  Morning shows, too, have for decades welcomed celebrities into their set kitchens for early-morning meal-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is entertainment, it’s something you bond over,” Moore told CNN, “Food is culture. People want to interact with each other, and food provides the glue for that.”\n \n\n   \n  In the mid-2010s, the format saw a new iteration of the approach emerge with a gourmet of YouTube shows featuring hungry celebrities – a disruption to what Evans called a “boring,” “PR-driven flight pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hot Ones” mixed up the media blitz. Ten years after its first episode, it is now a desired destination for megastars such as Jennifer Lawrance, Idris Elba,  Lady Gaga  and Shaquille O’Neal, whose reactions to the exponential Scoville levels have been immortalized in internet lore.\n \n\n   \n  “What these food-driven formats reveal is that adding a slice of real life to the interview process (a meal, a drink, or any shared activity) invites authenticity, connection and unexpected honesty,” Lindsay Colker, founder of Elevate Communications, a Los Angeles-based public relations and consulting boutique, told CNN. “And that’s where the magic and the viral moments tend to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Colker highlighted the format’s ability to blur the lines between “press appearance and personality showcase,” which is aided by hosts who are “often culture-shapers in their own right - disarming, conversational and curious.”\n \n\n   \n  “They know how to draw out personality instead of polished talking points,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But she emphasized that food-themed interviews – and the wave of new media at large – are complementary and not a replacement to traditional celebrity coverage.\n \n\n   \n  What’s remarkable about these YouTube food-themed interviews is the fact that the ingredients to their success aren’t concealed in secret family heirloom or fabled recipes; no 11 herbs and spices kept away from the other online creators. It’s a straightforward blend of originality, ingenuity and accessibility.\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY had already invested years in creating food content prior to featuring celebrities in their videos. Josh Carrott, the other half of JOLLY, and Kendal said that getting celebrities to share food and culture away from the “sterile, sanitized junket world,” is not a fading gimmick they’re squeezing for views.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is like the great connector,” Carrott said. “I think over the years, our content has evolved into sharing culture through food.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Like’ and subscribe\n \n\n   \n  Evans likens the growth of food-themed interviews to that of podcasts, which were once relatively obscure but are now omnipresent.\n \n\n   \n  “The landscape is going to shift,” said Evans, “But, overall, if you like interview shows, you have certainly tons of options, and I think at a higher quality now than 10 years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Evans celebrates the growth of the niche from “barren, empty shelves” to a marketplace filled with great offerings, but he also acknowledges the concerns that it might be too much, conceding that audience fatigue is plausible in the midst of what he described as the “boom times” of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said that no matter how famous a host or a guest is, or how elaborate and slick a production is, an unauthentic product will not resonate with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Colker echoed the sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  “These types of appearances only fatigue clients when they start to feel repetitive or disconnected from their story,” Colker said. “The sweet spot is where creativity meets comfort and when it feels natural, not performative.”\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY’s approach to content creation has always centered the fans as its North Star, which they try to follow through endless trial and error, as well as excruciating analysis of audience metrics. This includes an examination of the kinds of brands and celebrities JOLLY looks to associate with, the best platforms to reach their audience and even the lengths of videos.\n \n\n   \n  “The focus for us has been: Can we make good content that people want to see?” Kendal said, “We’re not really interested in doing content for content’s sake.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether food-themed interviews have reached their inflection point, let alone oversaturation, is yet to be determined. For now, the proof is in the pudding as more online creators and legacy media outlets continue to add to the loaded pantry of this genre.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, Vogue revived an infrequent online cooking segment under a new title,  Now Serving.  YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell’s rebranded her FEEDING STARVING INFLUENCERS series to now feature celebrities. And across the pond, broadcaster Nick Grimshaw and Michelin star chef Angela Hartnett launched  Dish,  where celebrities enjoy conversations over one of Hartnett’s acclaimed creations.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, other creators and outlets have seemingly started to  abandon the concept. Harper’s BAZAAR’s online series,  Food Diaries , was abruptly discontinued in 2023 after a six-year run, and internet personality, Joey Camasta, concluded his raunchy take on the concept after only one season of  Could I Get in Your Pantry?  \n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Hearst and Camasta for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But as long as the media climate provides the perfect temperature for these shows to grow and expand, and until audiences are satiated to the point of nausea, creators will continue to cook up fresh ideas.\n \n\n   \n  Carrott and Kendal are already manifesting their dream episodes: southern biscuits and gravy versus English tea and biscuits with Matthew McConaughey, and going through the Waffle House menu with Prince Harry.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of a perfect example of what we want to achieve,” said Carrott. “Sharing culture and authentic passion over a meal with someone.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/military-teachers-pay-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-05:00","title":"Teachers Working Without Pay in US Military Schools During Shutdown Receive Debt Letters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the 2025 U.S. government shutdown that began on October 1, civilian employees of the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA), including teachers and administrators, were forced to work without pay.

Teachers working without pay in US military schools during shutdown received debt letters \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Teachers and other employees of US military schools who have been working without pay during the  government shutdown  received letters this week telling them they owed money to the government, CNN has learned.\n \n\n   \n  Debt letters outlining that personnel have been “overpaid” by various amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to more than $1,000, according to letters viewed by CNN. The letters, sent by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told employees they have 70 days from the date of the letter to pay the debts.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) told employees that the letters were sent out in error due to a glitch that will be corrected once the government is funded. But impacted employees told CNN the letters added to the stress of Defense Department civilians who have been deemed essential and have worked without pay since the shutdown began on October 1. Sources familiar with the letters told CNN it was sent to not only teachers, but principals and other administrative DoDEA employees.\n \n\n   \n  “DoDEA claims it will be corrected at some point after the shutdown ends but gave no indication of when or what the process to correct it will be,” one employee said. “So, in the meantime, DoDEA teachers will continue to not only work for no pay but also be charged a debt for each day we are forced to work without pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian pointed to longstanding issues with the military’s pay system and said they have little faith the issue will be resolved quickly. A third individual living overseas posted on social media that they received the letter and said the stress “is becoming overwhelming.”\n \n\n   \n  The DoDEA system has 161 schools at home and abroad at US military installations, according to the agency’s website, and teaches more than 60,000 students. As of 2022, there were more than 11,000 full-time personnel within DoDEA.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has ensured active members of the military are being paid throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The director of the DoDEA, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, told employees in an email on Thursday, which was obtained by CNN, that the agency is aware of the “various pay-related issues.” DoDEA is “working closely with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) to obtain all necessary information regarding the problems that are employees are experiencing due to payroll status changes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue largely was due to a coding error due to the shutdown, Schiavino-Narvaez’s email said. All employees must be identified by a code for “Leave Without Pay” during the lapse in appropriations for timekeeping purposes, she said. Teachers and administrators’ salaries are based on the number of days in a school year they are paid for, the email goes on to explain, and therefore when a Leave Without Pay code is entered into the pay system, “the payroll system automatically adjusts for overpayment because fewer than the required number of days will be recorded.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, due to the age of its system and regulatory requirements, DFAS is unable to override these adjustments, and a debt letter is automatically issued,” the director’s email said.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavino-Narvaez specifies in the email that once the government is funded, timecards will be corrected – but she also told employees that it may take “several pay periods to fully reconcile and cancel” any outstanding debt.\n \n\n   \n  Employees “are not required to make any payments on debt letters at this time,” she said, adding that she recognizes “we are all experiencing extraordinary challenges due to the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that the morale of civilian employees around the globe — many of whom are veterans or military family members themselves — is dropping rapidly with many considering leaving government service.\n \n\n   \n  The first affected DoDEA employee told CNN that to say the director’s reassurances “don’t mean much is an understatement.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have no urgency to correct this and just tell us to basically wait and hope for the best,” the employee said, “because they don’t know how to fix this and don’t seem overly concerned with finding a method to fix this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/reopen-federal-government-next-steps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:20:00-05:00","title":"The Senate Cleared a Key Hurdle.

But party leaders believe lawmakers will, indeed, end the stalemate this week.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what still needs to happen on Capitol Hill to reopen the federal government.\n \n\n   \n    Senate timing agreement and vote\n \n\n   \n  Now, senators need to agree on how long to debate before voting on the final bill. This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who voted against advancing the measure, wants a vote on an amendment related to hemp grown in his state. It’s unclear if that will happen.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it “remains to be seen” when the Senate will be able to vote on final passage of the bill, though he hopes it passes early this week.\n \n\n   \n  The final package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through the remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  Once it passes the Senate, the package heads to the House, which will present its own host of complications.\n \n\n   \n    Then it’s the House’s turn\n \n\n   \n  Members of the House were advised to expect votes this week.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin majority, and he’ll likely need the president’s help to muscle it through his fractious conference.\n \n\n   \n  Praising the Senate for reaching a deal to reopen the government and warning his members to make their way back to Washington, Johnson said Monday: “I’m stating the obvious all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said he will give 36-hour notice to House members for a vote as soon as the Senate has final passage of the CR in the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “At least some Democrats,” he said, “now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands, so it’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson approve it.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats are set to huddle as a caucus on Monday, according to a personal familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Though the next few days will be critical, a source familiar with the matter said GOP leaders are optimistic about the funding bill’s chances for passage in the House. And a Democratic source familiar expects some in the party will cross lines to support it, though it remains to be seen how many.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse all of the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed while the shutdown occurred.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-project-athena","dateOfPublication":"1110-12-01","timeOfPublication":"11:10:00+00:00","title":"A plan written by Trump’s NASA pick was leaked.

Here’s what to know about ‘Project Athena’ \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:11 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again pick to run NASA,  billionaire Jared Isaacman , outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, who was  tapped  to be NASA administrator after Trump was elected in 2024, only to see his nomination  retracted  months later, was  renominated  for the top job last Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he  said  in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete.\n \n\n   \n  It nonetheless set off a flurry of speculation about how the space agency would function with Isaacman at the helm. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman  said  that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency.\n \n\n   \n  If enacted, many of the policies laid out could significantly alter the day-to-day lives of NASA workers and transform the 67-year-old agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is presenting a more dramatic set of changes than many in the space community were expecting,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, of the document.\n \n\n   \n  Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman still faces a confirmation vote in the Senate and would need Congressional approval for many of the objectives mapped out in the document.\n \n\n   \n  As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice  flown to orbit  on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA’s top role.\n \n\n   \n  Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he’s perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era.\n \n\n   \n    A power struggle\n \n\n   \n  According to a source familiar with the matter, the original Project Athena document was more than 100 pages. Isaacman made only three hard copies of a truncated 62-page version and distributed them to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and his chief of staff. The leak — according to a recent Ars Technica report and a source who confirmed the account to CNN — looked to have been part of an effort by Duffy, who is temporarily running NASA, to spur controversy and potentially thwart Isaacman’s renomination.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously  reported  that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he’s said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.)\n \n\n   \n  “If there is any friction, I suspect it is more political operators causing the controversy,” Isaacman said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman was renominated for the NASA post on November 4, one day after reports about the Athena document began circulating in the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I think (the people who leaked Project Athena) thought this would ruffle feathers amongst the delegations that care about human spaceflight,” said one former NASA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private document. “I will tell you — it hasn’t worked.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — the home of Goddard Space Flight Center — offered the most detailed responses.\n \n\n   \n  Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.”\n \n\n   \n  “To protect our nation’s innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration’s chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said.\n \n\n   \n  Warner, whose state houses NASA’s Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.”\n \n\n   \n  “The reported proposals to downsize or privatize key missions at Langley and Wallops would be a serious mistake, jeopardizing critical scientific capabilities and the talented workforce whose expertise keeps the United States at the forefront of aerospace research,” Warner’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman’s confirmation.\n \n\n   \n    A Mars shot and nuclear propulsion\n \n\n   \n  One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that vision, the source familiar with the document told CNN, was intended to align NASA with SpaceX’s goal of sending an uncrewed Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface next year.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX’s plan, which CEO Elon Musk  discussed  publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The thinking was that NASA could step in to provide support through the Olympus program at minimal cost to taxpayers, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n  The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for  RealClearScience  that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.”\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues.\n \n\n   \n  “Our competitors are not waiting. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. If America wants to lead, NASA must take on the hard problems again and do the near-impossible,” Isaacman and Gingrich wrote in the article.\n \n\n   \n  Project Athena also suggests setting up a demonstration mission to dock a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft with a crewed vehicle in orbit, according to the leaked paper.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s nuclear vision also proposes that NASA centers working on projects like the  Space Launch System rocket  — including the Marshall and Michoud facilities in Alabama and Louisiana — shift their focus to nuclear electric propulsion development when the SLS program concludes.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.”\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the document noted that it was crafted around the same time the Trump White House drafted the President’s Budget Request, or PBR, which called for canceling NASA’s SLS rocket and some other major projects that could have left multiple NASA centers without a cornerstone program.\n \n\n   \n  The source said that Isaacman began compiling the Project Athena document in late 2024 and updated it as he had conversations with policymakers. The source also said that Isaacman did not help draft the PBR.\n \n\n   \n  With this summer’s “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman  said  November 4 on social media that he hopes to zero-in on those pursuits only after a “foundation” of lunar exploration has been built.\n \n\n   \n    To the moon\n \n\n   \n  When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his  inaugural address  while staying silent on NASA’s ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman echoed Trump’s Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA’s moon program. However, questions about how he would fund such projects  loomed .\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, however, the moon has emerged as the  clear policy priority  amid a renewed space race with China, which is aiming to land its taikonauts on the lunar surface by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The recent push to bolster NASA’s moon missions, including a $10 billion influx Congress gave the agency’s human spaceflight efforts in July, “brings clarity to the topic,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman is back in the running for the top NASA job at a time when the agency’s plans for a crewed moon landing, called Artemis III, are  in flux .\n \n\n   \n    Shifting lunar plans\n \n\n   \n  The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX’s Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface.\n \n\n   \n  But some policy experts have grown increasingly  concerned  that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA’s urgent timeline.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy recently signaled  a willingness to boot SpaceX  off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers.\n \n\n   \n  Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman’s, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “ Sean Dummy .”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander.\n \n\n   \n  The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman said. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.”\n \n\n   \n    Uncertainty for science\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the Project Athena document said some of the more controversial aspects of the plan warrant more explanation.\n \n\n   \n  One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation’s ability to gather crucial environmental data.\n \n\n   \n  The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA’s initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures, calling for researchers to focus on purchasing data from the private sector, could mark a significant change for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a  pair of Mars missions  were lost.\n \n\n   \n  And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman’s Athena document suggests it can, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn’t had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has also publicly defended science programs such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was slated for budget cuts in the PBR. And he stated he’d be willing to spend his own money to get the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope off the ground. “I was prepared to personally cover the cost to launch Roman — if that’s what it took to get to the science,” Isaacman said in a June social media  post . (That same promise appears in the Project Athena document.)\n \n\n   \n  “Anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue,” Isaacman’s November 4 statement reads.\n \n\n   \n    A rankled workforce\n \n\n   \n  Among the other proposals in the Project Athena document are plans to hasten NASA’s reorganization. The agency has already lost roughly 4,000 of its 18,000 employees as part of the Trump administration’s deferred resignation program.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.”\n \n\n   \n  Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been  reeling  from looming budget cuts and what employees have  described  as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA’s boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency’s approach to risk assessment.\n \n\n   \n  “We will ensure safety is at the forefront of our decisions but achieving the mission of NASA means accepting that some risks are worth taking,” the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency.\n \n\n   \n  It would be unwise, he added, to start eliminating safety organizations — but they could be revamped to create a “healthy tension” between risk assessors and engineers seeking to push boundaries.\n \n\n   \n  However, he cautioned that “it’s really hard to know in the moment if you’re going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It’s a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.”\n \n\n   \n    A leader of change\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump’s proposed cuts to research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s renomination to the NASA chief job now presents “a good opportunity to engage on some of these proposals, particularly as they relate to science,” Dreier added.\n \n\n   \n  In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.”\n \n\n   \n  But he did not wish to debate the plan “line-by-line while NASA and the rest of the government are going through a shutdown,” according to the November 4 post.\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post in June, for example, Isaacman wrote that he “didn’t love” being approached by “people who thought they were uniquely NASA’s savior.” He added: “I have little interest in doing the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/mail-in-ballots-supreme-court-mississippi","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Agrees to Decide if Mail-in Ballots Can Arrive After Election Day","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether states can count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, focusing on a Republican-led lawsuit against Mississippi’s law allowing ballots to be received up to five days after Election Day.

after Election Day , taking up a Republican-led lawsuit that could affect election laws in more than a dozen states across the country.\n \n\n   \n  It is the latest of several high-profile voting cases to make it on to the Supreme Court’s docket this year as the justices are asked to deal with controversies dating back over the past several elections.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen states allow regular mail ballots to be accepted after Election Day, including  presidential battleground Nevada . Most of the nation’s battleground states – including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – require ballots to be received by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other states accept military ballots after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  A Mississippi law, enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic, allows ballots to be received up to five days late, so long as they are postmarked by Election Day. The Republican National Committee and others sued over that law, claiming the provision violated a federal law that fixes the date for the election.\n \n\n   \n  “With rare outliers, the states mandated that ballots must be received by election officials by election day,” the RNC told the Supreme Court in written arguments this year. “But recently, an increasing number of States – including Mississippi – have deviated from that practice by permitting at least some ballots to be received after election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials in Mississippi, where  Trump carried more than 60% of the vote , have questioned the RNC’s logic. An election, they told the Supreme Court, is the choice of an official.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters make that choice by casting – marking and submitting – their ballots by election day. The election has then occurred, even if election officials do not receive all ballots by that day,” Mississippi officials said in written arguments. “Under Mississippi law, voters cast their ballots by election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Raising doubts about ballots that were not counted until after Election Day was key to President Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the 2020 election. The question in the case is about ballots that were received after the election, not ballots that are received before the election but not counted until later.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Mississippi was  violating federal law by counting mail ballots that arrived after Election Day , but the court notably stopped short of blocking the state’s policy before the 2024 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court is already considering other important cases involving voting and elections. It heard arguments in October in a case challenging the power of the Voting Rights Act to limit  discrimination in redistricting . The Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority  signaled deep skepticism  in that case over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in a case that could have nationwide implications.\n \n\n   \n  And a majority of the court late month indicated it would likely back a Republican congressman from Illinois who is challenging a state law that allows  mail ballots to be received after Election Day , a decision that would let him proceed with a potentially explosive lawsuit that lower courts had rejected.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-obergefell-kim-davis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:58:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Declines to Revisit Landmark Same-Sex Marriage Precedent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, thereby reaffirming the constitutional right to same-sex marriage established in the 2015 Obergefell v.

Hodges  allowed same-sex couples to marry.\n \n\n   \n  The court did not explain its reasoning to deny the appeal, which had received outsized attention – in part because the court’s 6-3 conservative majority three years ago overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion that 1973 decision established. Since then, fears about Obergefell being the precedent to fall have grown.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, love won again,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “When public officials take an oath to serve their communities, that promise extends to everyone – including LGBTQ+ people. The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, the legal group that represented Davis, said the former clerk would now face “crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like the abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, Obergefell was egregiously wrong from the start,” Staver said. “We will continue to work to overturn Obergefell. It is not a matter of if, but when the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court today is far different and far more conservative than the one that decided Obergefell in 2015, which is part of what had given LGBTQ advocates pause about the Davis appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote who authored the Obergefell decision, retired in 2018 and was replaced by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon who was also in the Obergefell majority, died in 2020 and was succeeded by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative.\n \n\n   \n  Three current justices – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – were in dissent in Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s opinion spoke eloquently of the most fundamental values of family, love and liberty.\n \n\n   \n  “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.”\n \n\n   \n  The Obergefell decision prompted a massive celebration that began outside the Supreme Court on the day it was decided in late June of 2015. That evening, the White House was lit in rainbow colors. Many same-sex couples rushed into courthouses to wed. Nearly 600,000 same-sex couples have since married, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n \n\n   \n  But some conservatives viewed the outcome as a betrayal and predicted future conflicts with religion. Davis, who at the time was the clerk of Rowan County in Kentucky, cited her religious objection to same-sex marriage as justifying her decision to withhold marriage licenses to all couples. She was sued by multiple couples in the county, and a jury ordered her to pay $360,000 in damages and legal fees.\n \n\n   \n  After a federal court found she had violated a court order to issue licenses, Davis was also thrown in jail for several days.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in dissent, the late Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the court’s decision as a “threat to American democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me,” he wrote. “But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis had argued that it was time “for a course correction” on Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  While virtually all of the focus on Davis’ appeal was aimed at her request to overturn Obergefell, the bulk of case actually dealt with a series of more technical questions. In appealing the damages verdict against her, the former clerk argued that the First Amendment’s religious protections should shield her from legal liability, particularly since she is no longer a public official. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Several conservatives justices had signaled in recent weeks that there was no great appetite to reopen Obergefell. Barrett  told the  New York Times  last month there are “very concrete reliance interests” at stake when it comes to same-sex marriage. Alito, while criticizing the precedent broadly during an address in Washington earlier this fall, stressed that it was a “precedent of the court that is entitled to the respect afforded by the doctrine of stare decisis.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, there have been worrying signs for LGBTQ rights groups – particularly when it comes to cases involving transgender Americans. In recent months, the high court handed down a major decision allowing states to ban the use of  puberty blockers and hormone therapy  for trans youth, allowed the Trump administration to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military and allowed the administration to require US passports to include sex markers consistent with a  person’s sex at birth .\n \n\n   \n  Mary Bonauto, a veteran civil rights attorney at GLAD Law who argued the Obergefell case, celebrated the court’s quick rejection of Davis’ appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that has changed since  Obergefell  was decided is that people across the country have seen how marriage equality provides protection for families and children, and that protection strengthens communities, the economy and our society,” Bonauto said. “Today millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief for their families, current or hoped for, because all families deserve equal rights under the law.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s decision to decline to hear the Davis appeal sets no precedent. If another appeal arrives threatening to undermine or overturn Obergefell, the court will review that appeal from scratch.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional details and reaction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-special-treatment-commutation-raskin-whistleblower","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:43:00-05:00","title":"Ghislaine Maxwell Gets Special Treatment in Prison, Rep.

“Carrie” is legendary. For the star, it’s a reminder of how “terrible” it was to film.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of next year’s 50th anniversary of the 1976 film, which is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name,  Spacek talked to “Entertainment Tonight”  about the now famous scene. She also expressed shock that the film was almost a half a century old.\n \n\n   \n  Spacek starred as the bullied high schooler who has telekinetic abilities which become unleashed over the course of the film, culminating in a fit of murderous rage over some very aggressive bullying: being doused with pig’s blood.\n \n\n   \n  One thing stuck out to her: “How sticky movie blood is,” Spacek said. “It was terrible, terrible, terrible.”\n \n\n   \n  She enjoyed, however, working with her costars, including Nancy Allen, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving and John Travolta, as well as director Brian De Palma.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so wonderful to get to work with people who are really into what they are doing,” Spacek said.\n \n\n   \n  The actress is currently appearing in the well-reviewed new film “Die My Love,” directed by Lynne Ramsay, and starring Jennifer Lawrence.

November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s second nature for some people to pour a glass of wine on a nice evening or to pop open a can of beer during a sports event — but when does drinking become too much?\n \n\n   \n  Heavy alcohol use, which researchers defined as regular alcohol consumption of three or more drinks per day, is linked to more severe brain bleeds (or a bleeding stroke) and earlier long-term brain damage, according to a study published November 5, in the journal  Neurology .\n \n\n   \n  “A bleeding stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage, is when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing blood to leak out and damage the surrounding brain tissue. Bleeding strokes account for about (15% to 20%) of all strokes,” Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer of brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association, said in an email. He was not part of the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The other kind of stroke, about 80%, is an  ischemic stroke , in which a clot or blockage of the blood vessel occurs and there is a lack of blood flow to part of the brain, causing it to die from lack of oxygen and nutrients,” Elkind said. “Bleeding strokes are typically more dangerous and disabling.”\n \n\n   \n  Some  17%  of adults in the United States binge drink and 6% drink heavily, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024,  29.7 million  Americans ages 12 and older had alcohol use disorder, a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption that can cause impairment of physical or mental health.\n \n\n   \n  “People who were drinking an average of three glasses of alcohol per day had their brain bleeds on an average of 11 years younger than compared to people who were drinking less glasses of alcohol,” said Dr. M. Edip Gurol, the study’s lead author.\n \n\n   \n    Who is at risk of a bleeding stroke?\n \n\n   \n  In the United States,  795,000 people  experience a stroke each year, and 10% of those are bleeding strokes.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, anyone — even children — can have a bleeding stroke. But the risks go up quickly with age, especially after age 55 or so,” said Elkind, professor emeritus of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University. “The most important risk factor for brain hemorrhage overall is high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension increases with age. Recently we have been seeing more strokes in younger people due to increasing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in young adults.”\n \n\n   \n   Nearly half of American adults , or 119.9 million people, have hypertension or high blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Some  symptoms  of high blood pressure include headaches, shortness of breath and nosebleeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Another important cause of strokes in younger people is the use of illicit substances: so not just alcohol, but use of cocaine, methamphetamine and other stimulants, heroin and other injected drugs, can lead to strokes and brain hemorrhages,” Elkind said. “Alcohol — and stimulants, in particular — can increase blood pressure, leading to higher risk of strokes of all types, including bleeding.”\n \n\n   \n  Other than stroke,  hypertension  can also cause chronic kidney disease, heart disease and artery disease.\n \n\n   \n  “For patients who had a brain bleed or patients who have MRI markers of higher than usual brain bleeding risk such as brain microbleeds, I recommend them to completely stop alcohol intake or use it very sparingly,” said Gurol, a vascular neurologist at Mass General Brigham, suggesting no more than up to six times per year and never exceeding more than a glass over 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n    Decreasing your risk of a bleeding stroke\n \n\n   \n  Elkind recommends getting your blood pressure under control to help prevent a stroke.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it checked by a doctor or at a local pharmacy,” he said, “and if elevated, get it under control through lifestyle change and medication, if needed.”\n \n\n   \n  An easy way to lower blood pressure is to do aerobic exercises, such as  walking . Following good  walking form  by standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms and practicing  conscious or nasal breathing  will help regulate your body.\n \n\n   \n  Changes in your diet, such as  reducing salt intake  and following a  Mediterranean diet , can also improve heart health and lower blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  The new study’s findings were based on data collected from 1,600 adults with a median age of 75 who were hospitalized for intracerebral hemorrhage. Participants were all admitted patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and were predominantly White.\n \n\n   \n  Since data was collected retrospectively, it “could be biased by the occurrence of the hemorrhage itself: people or proxies may report higher levels of alcohol consumption after a life-changing event like a cerebral hemorrhage. This could lead to biased estimates of the effect,” Elkind said. “In a true prospectively designed study, the data about alcohol consumption would be collected before the hemorrhage had occurred.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/boat-strike-76-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:07:00Z","title":"US military strikes 2 boats, killing 6 in Eastern Pacific","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted two strikes in the Eastern Pacific targeting two boats suspected of carrying narcotics and operated by organizations linked to illicit trafficking, killing six people.

Vandoorne, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:25 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As all eyes turned to the Louvre after the  shocking theft  of the  French crown jewels , one especially stylish figure on the museum grounds caught the internet’s attention: a sharply dressed young man, wearing a three-piece suit and a fedora tilted just so.\n \n\n   \n  As speculation swirled about the identity of the so-called “French detective” pictured at the scene, 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, who featured in the photo, was enjoying his new double life.\n \n\n   \n  The teenager met CNN at his home in Rambouillet, about 30 miles southwest of the French capital, to discuss the social media furor.\n \n\n   \n  Though he may cite fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot as a style icon, Pedro confirmed that he was not involved in any investigations and that he had not been able to locate any of the €88 million ($102m) stolen crown jewels.\n \n\n   \n  He learned about the viral photo when a friend showed him a TikTok video with the now-famous image. The video had nearly 6 million views.\n \n\n   \n  “In the moment, it was, like, very funny. And we went back to the Louvre to see the reaction of the people,” he told CNN. “People maybe recognized me, but I’m not sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Pedro had planned to spend October 19, the day of the Louvre heist, at the famed museum with his mother and grandfather. When the trio arrived to find the museum closed, the stylish highschooler was unknowingly photographed by an AP journalist documenting the crime scene.\n \n\n   \n  What many online commentators had deemed a detective outfit is simply Pedro’s everyday look.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s important to dress classic. And I like to dress like that because I love history, especially the 20th century,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The young history buff has been embracing 40s-era fashion for almost a year now, he said. His obsession with the style began when he dressed as Jean Moulin, a hero of the French resistance during World War II, for carnival, a festive period celebrated in many countries ahead of Lent. Amid the parades and costumed festival-goers, he found a liking for the new look.\n \n\n   \n  “He realized the effect he had on other people,” his mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, explained. “Everyone looked impressed.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:52 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the days grow shorter and darkness comes on quicker, the  NFL  season continues with a pivotal Week 10 delivering the same madness to which fans are accustomed.\n \n\n   \n  The week was more eventful than usual, starting with the NFL trade deadline that was highlighted by the New York Jets making headlines after a shocking fire sale that saw Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams find new homes in Indianapolis and Dallas respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday got started bright and early with Jonathan Taylor leading the Colts to an overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons in Germany, which led right into multiple teams in the bottom of the standings finding a way to secure victories.\n \n\n   \n  It also saw the New England Patriots officially commandeer their spot among the league’s elite and many blowouts in the late-game slate, including an appearance from President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Colts run all over Falcons in Germany\n \n\n   \n  The NFL’s penultimate international game of the season took place at Berlin’s Olympiastadion and delivered one of the best games of the season.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor powered the Colts to a 31-25 overtime victory over the Falcons in the first regular-season NFL game in the German capital.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old rushed for 244 yards and three touchdowns, becoming just the fourth player in league history to record at least 200 rushing yards and three rushing scores in a game twice in his career, joining Jim Brown, Adrian Peterson and Derrick Henry.\n \n\n   \n  An 83-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter put the Colts ahead 22-17, but Atlanta answered with a one-yard touchdown from Tyler Allgeier to retake the lead with just over a minute left. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones then led an eight-play drive, setting up Michael Badgley’s 44-yard field goal to force overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor sealed the win for Indianapolis with a walk-off eight-yard touchdown in overtime, moving the Colts to an AFC South-best 8-2 record while the Falcons dropped to 3-6.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders and Miami Dolphins will close out the international slate on November 16 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.\n \n\n   \n    The week of the upset\n \n\n   \n  The Jets, New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins haven’t had much to celebrate this season.\n \n\n   \n  But on Sunday, all three teams managed to pick up a victory.\n \n\n   \n  The Jets secured their first win of the season two weeks ago against the Cincinnati Bengals and were well-rested coming off their their bye week.\n \n\n   \n  Riding that momentum, the Aaron Glenn-led squad faced the other Ohio-based team – the Cleveland Browns – and won 27-20 for their second consecutive win.\n \n\n   \n  Special teams played the hero for Gang Green, scoring touchdowns on a kickoff return and a punt return with running back Breece Hall’s 42-yard receiving touchdown to cap it all off. Both teams are now 2-7. The Jets will look for their first three-game win streak since 2023 when they face the Patriots on Thursday Night Football next week.\n \n\n   \n  Questions are swirling throughout the NFL about the futures of head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa after the firing of general manager Chris Grier a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  And a tough task was on hand for the Fins, facing the Buffalo Bills – a team that Miami had lost to seven-straight time entering the game at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Fins blew out Buffalo 30-13 to snap the losing streak to their divison rivals and easing any qualms – at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  The Saints turned to their rookie, second-round pick Tyler Shough, against division rivals Carolina Panthers and did he deliver.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old, out of Louisville, threw for 282 yards and two touchdowns in their 17-7 win to improve to 2-8 on the season.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots are back. Are they here to stay?\n \n\n   \n  Times were tough for the Patriots in the years following the departure of Tom Brady and Bill Bellichick.\n \n\n   \n  With Mike Vrabel returning to Foxborough as head coach—a place where he won multiple Super Bowls as a player—and rookie quarterback Drake Maye emerging as the franchise leader they hoped for, New England has reestablished itself among the league’s elite teams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats marched into Tampa Bay and defeated Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers 28-23 as Maye passed for two touchdowns and rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson rushed for two more on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  After a 4-13 record last season, New England finds themselves with a 8-2 record and an AFC East division lead.\n \n\n   \n    A late-game slate filled with blowouts and the president\n \n\n   \n  All the excitement fans were presented with earlier in the day was completely wiped up by the three-game late slate, which all featured blowouts.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since President Jimmy Carter when he arrived Sunday at Northwest Stadium in Maryland for the  Washington Commanders  game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  While the President was met with boos, so were the Commanders as they were crushed 44-22 by the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  Sam Darnold is yet again proving why he is one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the league after leading the Seattle Seahawks to a 44-22 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n \n\n   \n  The former first round pick 178 yards and a touchdown while defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence returned two fumbles for touchdowns in the win. Seahawks find themselves in a race for the NFC West division with the Los Angeles Rams, who also won Sunday in convincing fashion.\n \n\n   \n  Matt Stafford threw for four touchdowns in the team’s 42-26 win over the short-handed San Francisco 49ers.\n \n\n   \n  Both teams find themselves with a 7-2 record with seven games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  There is still one game to go in the week with the reigning Super Bowl champions Philadelphia Eagles visiting Titletown, USA, to face the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/democrats-voting-government-shutdown-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:01:00-05:00","title":"Democrats Vote with Republicans to End Government Shutdown Over ACA Subsidy Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan agreement to end a 40-day government shutdown was reached, with a group of Democrats and one independent (Angus King) leading the effort.

\n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A group of Democrats and one Democratic-aligned independent have helped clinch an agreement to  end the government shutdown , saying they had secured a vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies at the center of the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  The negotiators argued that Republicans’ “flat refusal” to move on Democrats’ earlier proposals made clear that “this is the best possible offer we could secure.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at some of those members, and their rationale for ending the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Four of them are former governors of their home states and none are up for reelection in next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois\n \n\n   \n  Durbin, a veteran member of Democratic leadership retiring at the end of his term, broke with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who opposes the deal.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Durbin said that “this bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  He underscored the cost of the disruptions caused by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “For 40 days—the longest shutdown in U.S. history—federal workers went without paychecks. This includes our air traffic controllers, whose towers were already understaffed. They continued to work 10 hours days, six days per week to keep our airspace safe, with this additional stress at a life-saving job,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Angus King of Maine\n \n\n   \n  King, an independent, was just elected to a third term in 2024. While he caucuses with the Democrats, King has a penchant for bipartisan dealmaking and was also among the key negotiators expressing alarm about the consequences of the ongoing shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on the ACA becoming any more likely? It appears not,” King said Sunday. “I think people are saying we’re not going to get what we want, although we still have a chance – because part of the deal is a vote on the ACA subsidies – but in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia\n \n\n   \n  Kaine was also elected to a third term in 2024. The former governor pointed to both ACA subsidies and efforts to defend the federal workforce, a key pressure point in his state, home to roughly 300,000 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans’ health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,” Kaine said in a statement about the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine said the deal “guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits,” and also that it “will protect federal workers from baseless firings, reinstate those who have been wrongfully terminated during the shutdown, and ensure federal workers receive back pay.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman, elected to the Senate in 2022, has been breaking with Democrats and voting for the House-passed short-term funding resolution. He said that the shutdown “has more than run its course.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we have the votes, it’s probably going to be the minimum if it does,” he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “Our party could be overplaying its hand,” he added. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen has announced she would not seek reelection in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Sunday, Shaheen said that “waiting longer will only prolong the pain Americans are feeling because of the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be clear: This is a major step that was not predetermined. I have spent years as the lead sponsor of this legislation. There is no one in the Senate who wants to see these tax credits extended more than me. But weeks of negotiations with Republicans have made clear that they will not address health care as part of shutdown talks,” Shaheen said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Hassan, another former governor, won reelection in 2022 to her swing-state seat. She told reporters that she had been hearing from residents both affected by looming spikes in health care costs and by people affected by the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Our work to deliver relief for families now enters an important phase,” she said. “Congress has one month to engage in serious bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts that help people afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Cortez Masto also voted to end the shutdown. Her term expires in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  “Too many Americans, hardworking individuals, seniors, children were suffering,” she said at a press conference, adding that she was seeing lines at food banks that rivaled the need during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  “We can open the government and we can still fight to address this looming health care crisis,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Rosen, the other Democrat from Nevada, joined her colleague in voting to end the shutdown. She was reelected last year.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Rosen said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What opponents are saying\n \n\n   \n  Many prominent members of the Democratic caucus opposed the deal and voiced ongoing concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m voting no on the continuing resolution that would double healthcare premiums for 20 million Americans, kick 15 million people off Medicaid & allow 50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year.

Sunday amid an escalating scandal over impartiality and bias that plunged Britain’s public broadcaster into one of its biggest crises in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s most senior executive, director general Tim Davie, and the chief executive of the news division, Deborah Turness, both quit after the leak of a deeply critical memo that, among other things, revealed that the BBC had misleadingly edited a  speech  by US President Donald Trump to make it appear that he had directly called for violence on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In a note to staff on Sunday afternoon, Davie said his resignation was “entirely my decision.” He added that as director general, he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  Turness said the controversy over a documentary made by the BBC’s “Panorama” series had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Samir Shah, chair of the BBC, on Monday apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over the way Trump’s speech was edited.\n \n\n   \n  The resignations come after the Telegraph newspaper published details of a leaked internal BBC dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines.\n \n\n   \n  In an internal whistleblowing memo, Prescott revealed that last year the BBC had broadcast a “doctored” Trump speech, making it seem that the president had encouraged Capitol Hill rioters, telling them he was going to walk with them to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump said in his speech in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, that “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump welcomed the news of the resignations and thanked the Telegraph for “exposing” corruption, which he called a “terrible thing for democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election,” he  wrote  on his Truth Social platform.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to British lawmakers on Monday, Shah, the chairman, conceded that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action,” for which the BBC apologized. He stressed “it is absolutely clear the BBC must champion impartiality,” adding that the broadcaster will take action to make sure it “retains the trust and confidence of the public we serve.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegations led White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to blast the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine.”\n \n\n   \n  British taxpayers are being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine,” Leavitt said in a recent interview with the Telegraph.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Leavitt posted a  brief response  to X, presenting the headline from the Telegraph article, followed by the BBC article announcing Davie’s resignation.\n \n\n   \n  After the report of the dossier emerged, Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared it on X, writing: “The FAKE NEWS ‘reporters’ in the UK are just as dishonest and full of s— as the ones here in America!!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Nandy, the British secretary of state for culture, media, and sport, thanked Davie for his work at the BBC after he announced his resignation.\n \n\n   \n  “He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years,” Nandy said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch applauded the resignation but said that there is a “catalogue of serious failures that runs far deeper” at the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  “The new leadership must now deliver genuine reform of the culture of the BBC, top to bottom - because it should not expect the public to keep funding it through a compulsory licence fee unless it can finally demonstrate true impartiality,” Badenoch  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is largely  funded  by a £174.50 ($228) license fee paid annually by every household in the United Kingdom that owns a television or watches its streaming content.\n \n\n   \n  As a public broadcaster, the organization is held to standards on its editorial independence and fairness.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC, whose charter  describes  its mission as providing “duly accurate and impartial news” in the public interest, has been pulled into controversy repeatedly over the years.\n \n\n   \n  BBC chairman Richard Sharp  resigned  in 2023 after a report found he failed to disclose his involvement in facilitating a loan of almost $1 million to former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC  faced a boycott  in 2023 after it suspended Gary Lineker from hosting the flagship soccer show after the former soccer player criticized the government’s asylum policy as “immeasurably cruel.” Lineker was later reinstated.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, director general George Entwistle  resigned  after a BBC report  falsely implicated  a senior British politician in a child abuse scandal.\n \n\n   \n  The director of news, Helen Boaden, and her deputy, Steve Mitchell, were  asked  to temporarily “step aside” later that year pending the outcome of an internal review related to a police investigation of sexual abuse by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile.\n \n\n   \n  In 2004, BBC director general Greg Dyke  resigned  after facing intense pressure over a government inquiry into a Ministry of Defense employee who died after being revealed as a source in a BBC report which claimed that the government had knowingly “sexed up” a dossier on whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/asia/malaysia-thailand-migrant-boat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"03:02:00-05:00","title":"Near dozen dead in Thai-Malaysia search after Rohingya migrant boat sinks","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A boat carrying Rohingya migrants sank near the Thailand-Malaysia border, resulting in 11 confirmed deaths and 70 people believed on board.

Americans who  rely on the nation’s largest federal food assistance program  have been caught in a weekslong swirl of Trump administration pronouncements, court orders and anxiety since the  US government shutdown  has called their ability to buy groceries into question.\n \n\n   \n  Some recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps, have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others  remain in limbo , uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a group of Democratic-led states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses have launched fast-moving legal challenges seeking to restore full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The fight over food benefits has become a central flashpoint between all three branches of government during the  historically long shutdown  as one of the clearest and most tangible ways the impasse is affecting Americans’ daily lives.\n \n\n   \n  While a  bipartisan Senate deal  has emerged to fund the government through January 30 and ensure SNAP benefits through fiscal year 2026, the successful procedural vote is only a first step. The measure must still pass the full Senate and the House before heading to the president’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  At stake is critical assistance nearly 42 million people rely on to  feed themselves and their families . On average, households receive about $350 a month in benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    It is unclear when all SNAP recipients will get November benefits\n \n\n   \n  It is still unclear when all recipients will receive their full allotment for November.\n \n\n   \n  Much depends on when – and whether – Congress actually approves a short-term spending package to temporarily fund federal agencies and reopen the government, and whether President Donald Trump signs it, which could take several more days to play out.\n \n\n   \n  If the deal falls through and the government remains shuttered, exactly how SNAP gets funded in the short term will continue to play out in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  At issue now is a lower court ruling ordering the US Department of Agriculture – which administers SNAP funds on the federal level – to swiftly issue full food stamp benefits to all recipients. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily halted the lower court ruling on Friday evening to allow the appeal to play out.\n \n\n   \n  Late Sunday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals declined a request by the Trump administration to block the lower court ruling, but the ruling has no immediate effect because Jackson’s temporary hold remains in place.\n \n\n   \n  Even after funding is decided and the USDA directs states to provide enrollees with their usual allotment, the timing of the benefits arriving will depend on the state: Some will be able to act immediately, while others may need more time.\n \n\n   \n    Some states have already issued partial or full benefits\n \n\n   \n  After a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to pay full SNAP benefits – and the agency issued guidance on Friday saying it was complying – several states rushed to distribute to recipients their full November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, California, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and Oregon are among the states to issue full SNAP benefits to at least some of their residents in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  Several states have said they will not seek to undo those distributions, as ordered Saturday by the USDA. The states argue they issued the full benefits before Jackson’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, meanwhile, issued partial benefits to recipients on Friday but has halted further action in light of Jackson’s stay.\n \n\n   \n    A weekslong series of court orders put millions in benefit limbo\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the turmoil is whether the USDA must pay full SNAP benefits without new funding from Congress and if courts can force the agency to fund the program during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the USDA said  it would not use  its roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund to provide at least partial payments for November. Full benefits for November are expected to total around $8.2 billion and other expenses push the total cost to nearly $9 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Lawsuits surfaced against the Trump administration, and on Halloween, two  federal judges rejected  the agency’s claim the contingency fund was untouchable and said the administration was required to tap into billions of those dollars to at least partially cover food stamp benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  Days after the administration  committed to providing 50%  – and  then 65%  – of the maximum allotments at the order of a federal judge in Rhode Island, the judge then said the government must immediately pivot to  fully cover SNAP  for tens of millions of Americans because some states might not be able to send partial payments for weeks or even months.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” US District Judge John McConnell said during a hastily called hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to stay McConnell’s decision. Still, the USDA announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with McConnell’s order.\n \n\n   \n  That evening, Jackson granted the administration’s request for a temporary pause, saying the government did not have to immediately transfer additional funds to provide full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s administrative stay freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Following the justice’s order, the USDA ordered states to  stop issuing full food stamp benefits  for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments. In the  Saturday directive , the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States failing to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over-issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly one in eight Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole and Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/flight-cancellation-government-shutdown-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00-05:00","title":"As Flight Cancellations Rise, People Are Turning to Trains, Car Rentals and Creative Solutions to Get to Their Destinations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, more than 1,000 flights have been canceled, leading to widespread travel disruptions.

As flight cancellations rise, people are turning to trains, car rentals and creative solutions to get to their destinations \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:29 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Xavier Vega and his partner, Soluna Vega, cheered in relief as the “Welcome to Connecticut” sign came into view. It marked the end of an unplanned 17-hour highway odyssey home after their flight became one of more than 1,000 cancellations on Saturday alone tied to the ongoing   government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who had to take a train, bus and a rental car   on Saturday   to drive over 1,100 miles from Florida, are among thousands of travelers whose plans have been   derailed by the widespread cancellations – and are searching   for other ways to get where they’re going.\n \n\n   \n  Rental car companies have been flooded with one-way bookings. Avis, Hertz and Turo all reported sharp increases in demand as passengers scrambled to make it to their destinations by any means necessary.\n \n\n   \n  An end to the travel woes could be in sight, with Senate lawmakers  voting on a key step  toward reopening the government Sunday night – but until then,  frustrated passengers continue to face flight delays and cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  For some like the Vegas, the disruptions have meant resorting to long drives, costly rebookings and days of uncertainty, all ripple effects of a shutdown that continues to grind the nation’s air system to a halt.\n \n\n   \n    The marathon to find their way home\n \n\n   \n  Exhausted and running on little sleep, Xavier and Soluna Vega set out on a 1,390-mile dash from Daytona Beach, Florida, to Connecticut, rushing to make it home on time for work Monday after spending $900 on a rental car – just two of countless travelers forced into marathon drives by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The nightmare began with what initially was a four-hour delay.\n \n\n   \n  “Our (Saturday) flight went from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., to 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m., and we just felt so hopeless,” Xavier Vega told CNN from their rental car on Sunday while his partner drove.\n \n\n   \n  The couple had disembarked from a cruise in Miami with their best friend and took a train to Orlando, only to face a nearly 10-hour flight delay that ended in cancellation. The situation continued to worsen; a music festival in Orlando had wiped the city’s supply of rental cars. Desperate to get home, they managed to hop on a bus, which they nearly missed, to Daytona Beach, scrambling for Plan C.\n \n\n   \n  But when they arrived, the situation was just as bleak; not a single rental car was available. Then, by sheer chance, a break came when they least expected it.\n \n\n   \n  “We got really lucky with a gentleman who happened to drop off his rental before his flight got canceled, so we ended up really cramped in a Kia Soul,” Vega said, remarkably positive for someone who’d just pulled an eight-hour overnight drive.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have it any other way, I just wanted to get home.”\n \n\n   \n    From backup plan to the only option\n \n\n   \n  Sean and Kelsey Fishkind were just hours away from what should have been a perfect third anniversary: a romantic night at “The Phantom of the Opera” in Baltimore. But two days ago, their celebration nearly fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the couple was en route from Boston to Washington, DC, when  their flight from their layover in New York’s LaGuardia Airport was abruptly canceled, and the next available option wasn’t until the following afternoon. But with the real possibility even that flight could be delayed or scrapped, the Fishkinds realized they’d have to find a backup plan, fast.\n \n\n   \n  At around 11 p.m., the couple says their only solution was a rental car, but finding one was easier said than done.\n \n\n   \n  According to Hertz, one-way rental bookings over the weekend surged 20% compared to the same period last year, and Turo reported a 30% jump in rentals on Friday alone.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen an increase in one-way rental activity as airlines adjust flight schedules and travelers explore alternative ways to reach their destinations,” an Avis spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Fishkinds were among the lucky ones, managing to secure a vehicle just in time for the four-and-a-half-hour drive to DC.\n \n\n   \n  But securing a rental car was the beginning of their ordeal. The couple says Delta Air Lines had assured them they’d be reimbursed for the car rental, but after hours of frustrating calls and multiple claims, they tell CNN they’re still left with no clear answers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Delta for comment regarding the incident and car rental reimbursement in cases related to the ongoing cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Delta said  in an earlier a statement  to customers that expense reimbursements aren’t available “for flights that are delayed or canceled due to adverse weather events or other circumstances outside of Delta’s control, including without limitation for hotels, rental cars, meals, ground transportation and other pre-paid expenses.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Transportation has said while airlines are  required to issue full refunds , “they will not be required to cover secondary costs,” which is the usual procedure when a cancellation or delay isn’t the carrier’s fault.\n \n\n   \n  For Sean Fishkind, a Federal Communications Commission employee furloughed due to the shutdown and without a paycheck for over 40 days, the stress is compounded.\n \n\n   \n  “From my perspective, with the impact it has on employees and the impact it has on the public, because I can’t do my job to serve the public, this is just another reminder of the more direct ways it’s starting to impact people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It kind of feels like they’re not doing the things they need to to try to come to a resolution.”   \n \n\n   \n    Patience and kindness go a long way, travelers say\n \n\n   \n  Despite the frustration and chaos, many travelers are navigating   the shutdown’s stress with unexpected kindness.\n \n\n   \n  “We were on the appreciative side,” said Xavier Vega, a former TSA worker of 10 years who was on the front line during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of times working for TSA, people hated us. But during the shutdown, people actually had empathy and were willing to help us,” he said. “They would give us Starbucks gift cards to get a coffee to kind of brighten up our days a little bit.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, Vega works at a group home for people with schizophrenia, many of whom lost their SNAP food aid benefits when the ongoing   shutdown froze funding from the US Department of Agriculture.   The situation remains tense. On Saturday, the US Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration  to pause full SNAP food aid benefits  for now, leaving recipients once again scrambling to make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very difficult to tell them, ‘Hey, you might not be eating this month.’ That also added into the understanding portion of it, because I’m experiencing it as someone who has mouths to feed,” Vega said.\n \n\n   \n  He added he also worried about travelers who don’t have the same flexibility or privilege when travel plans fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m thinking, there was a gentleman in a wheelchair at the airport,” Vega said. “How is he going to get home? He’s reliant on the certainty that his flight will get there on time, that his pickup (driver) from t﻿he airport will be there at the time he says he’s going to be there.”\n \n\n   \n  For David Tilden, the shutdown turned a birthday getaway into a logistical nightmare. After an eight-hour delay at LaGuardia and a last-minute cancellation at 11 p.m., Tilden told CNN he and his wife rented a car and endured a 14-hour drive back to Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  Tilden says he thinks the crisis isn’t just about politics—it’s about a lack of basic kindness, particularly from government systems.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe in the power of kindness and tenderness and love, and I believe in the conversation, and that’s gone in Washington. It’s disgusting, it’s traumatizing, and they should all be ashamed themselves,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A fundamental failure in the United States government’\n \n\n   \n  Although travelers are trying to stay optimistic, the outlook so far remains grim.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN air travel could be “reduced to a trickle” as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches and airlines continue to implement FAA-mandated reductions in flights.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be   required to gradually increase those cuts over the next week, with Duffy warning flight reductions  could increase to 20%  if the shutdown doesn’t end soon.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Senate convened a rare Saturday session, though senators  did not vote  and there is no deal in sight on a potential funding compromise. Majority Leader John Thune said he intends to  keep the chamber in session  until a deal is reached and the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s happening in Washington is like two kids watching their parents fight every day because they hate each other,” said Tilden, adding the shutdown and its impact on Americans is a stark contradiction to the values of American democracy and unity.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not the United States of America. This is the divided States of America. They’re hypocritical when they stand up and chant USA,” Tilden said.\n \n\n   \n  For Vega, the focus, he says, should be on the people most affected — the vulnerable, like the residents he works with who struggle with mental health issues worsened by the sudden loss of SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think whatever is being argued in Washington right now is more important than people having food on the table or being able to get from point A to point B with some level of certainty,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But if the shutdown stretches into the holidays, Vega believes it will signal a far deeper crisis beyond canceled flights.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, there has been a fundamental failure in the United States government, and we as citizens have to speak up on that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Manu Raju and   Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-11:10","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 76","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Between September 2 and November 9, 2025, the United States conducted 19 military strikes in both the Caribbean and Pacific oceans, resulting in the deaths of 76 people and the destruction of 20 boats.

\nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n    November 6\n \n\n   \n  The US military conducted a strike against a vessel in the Caribbean, killing three people, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters,” Hegseth said in a  post on X , adding that US forces were not harmed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n    November 9\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out another attack against suspected drug boats on Sunday, killing six people in the Eastern Pacific according, to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The military launched two lethal strikes against two separate vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations,” Hegseth  wrote on X , without disclosing which organizations the ships’ crew are believed to have been affiliated with.\n \n\n   \n  “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/middleeast/hamas-longest-held-hostage-returned-israel-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"03:04:00-05:00","title":"Israel confirms returned body belongs to soldier killed in Gaza in 2014 war","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has confirmed that the body returned to Israel on November 10, 2025, belongs to Lt.

Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier killed more than a decade ago in Gaza, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed in the final days of the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas and his body has been held in Gaza since then.\n \n\n   \n  “We brought Lt. Hadar Goldin - our son, a fighter - to be buried in Israel,” his father, Simcha Goldin, said in a televised statement outside their home in Kfar Saba on Sunday evening. “We do not abandon soldiers on the battlefield, because this is a value and we don’t compromise on values. Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.”\n \n\n   \n     Following the burial ceremony in Israel on Sunday, his mother, Leah Goldin, said, “The first is the value of friendship and comradeship, the second is the right to burial in Israel, and the third is human dignity. Sadly, we faced many disappointments. We cannot give up on who we are, and we will prevail through our values.”\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s return “provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonizing uncertainty and doubt for over 11 years,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, “I know the anguish that his family has endured. I know the pain and the solidarity that have united the entire people of Israel. And today, we are united in the knowledge that we have finally brought him back to his parents and to his family.”\n \n\n   \n  As with previous hostage returns, Hamas handed what it said was Goldin’s body to the the International Red Cross, which then transferred it to the Israeli military. The handover was part of the ceasefire agreement that brought the worst of the fighting in Gaza to an end a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s family has spent years campaigning for his return, citing Israel’s commitment to the principle of leaving no one behind in conflict. The international campaign for the return of hostages taken during the Hamas-led terror attack on October 7, 2023, put a new spotlight on their fight.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed on August 1, 2014, just as a ceasefire went into effect to end the conflict and just days before Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza. The Israeli military had activated the so-called Hannibal Directive, a controversial order that enables Israeli troops to take extraordinary measures to prevent a kidnapping, even at the risk of harming the abducted. Goldin’s abduction led to massive Israeli strikes in Rafah. He was 23 years old, one of 68 Israeli soldiers killed during the month-and-a-half-long war.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in that war, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire, Hamas was required to return all hostages, including the bodies of those who had been killed.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has previously assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The return of Goldin’s body leaves four deceased hostages still in Gaza. Three are Israelis who were killed on October 7, 2023, and whose bodies were taken to Gaza. The fourth is a Thai citizen who was kidnapped during the attack. The Thai government said in May 2024 that he was presumed dead.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/style/jadeite-cabbage-taiwan-forbidden-city-curio-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:04:00-11:10","title":"How a humble cabbage became one of the Forbidden City’s most memorable treasures","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Jadeite Cabbage, a realistic jade carving of a Chinese cabbage with insects, is one of the most popular artifacts at Taiwan’s National Palace Museum.

\nUpdated: \n        4:04 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Louvre’s “Mona Lisa,” the British Museum’s Rosetta Stone, MoMA’s “Starry Night” — major museums often have one must-see item that singlehandedly draws visitors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  For the National Palace Museum, in Taiwan’s capital Taipei, the star attraction is somewhat humbler: a cabbage.\n \n\n   \n  Carved from a block of white and green jadeite, the remarkably realistic sculpture of a Chinese cabbage glistens as if freshly picked from a field, still wet with morning dew. A katydid and locust lurk in its verdant leaves, while the unknown sculptor used the material’s natural flaws to create the illusion of ribs running along its stems.\n \n\n   \n  Resting gently on a wooden stand, the carving is just 7.4 inches tall. But it is so popular that it occupies its own exhibition hall. The museum even publicizes which dates the object will be away on “business trips” — in other words, when it is on loan or exhibited elsewhere — so visitors are not left disappointed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum does not record how many of its approximately 2 million annual visitors come specifically to view the Jadeite Cabbage. But the long line of people waiting to snap photos suggests that many, if not most, of them do. “When you see it in pictures, it doesn’t seem that vivid, but when you see it here in true light, it’s really more attractive,” said Chloe Wang, a tourist from mainland China, during a recent trip to the museum.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage’s popularity often sees it dubbed a “national treasure” of Taiwan, although the sculpture is not officially designated as such. Its image is pasted across merchandise and turned into plush toys and replica models, in the museum store and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage, like most of the National Palace Museum’s collection, is an imperial relic once housed at the Forbidden City in Beijing before being relocated to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. It is, by no means, the only one: Beijing’s Palace Museum and the Tianjin Museum, also in mainland China, both have cabbages carved from jade. In fact, the Taiwan museum itself even has two other examples.\n \n\n   \n  So why did this one, also known as “Jadeite Cabbage with Insects,” achieve global fame?\n \n\n   \n  Hsu Ya-hwei, an art history professor at National Taiwan University, said the jade’s shimmering colors and the sculptor’s technique help the piece stand out. “The craftsmanship, combined with this particular piece of the material, produced a good result,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the cabbage’s enduring popularity may also come down to its perceived symbolism. Possibly part of a dowry paid to China’s Guangxu Emperor by a consort in the 1880s, the artifact has long been associated with female purity, fertility and abundance. While some historians have questioned the long-held belief that the locust and katydid represent children — and whether the item was even a dowry gift — the idea nonetheless grabbed people’s imaginations, said Hsu.\n \n\n   \n  “The auspicious wishes contained in the artifact are quite important, and probably a key factor in its appeal to ordinary visitors,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Few historical clues\n \n\n   \n  After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Jadeite Cabbage was discovered sitting in a colorful enamel pot in the Forbidden City. It later went on show at Beijing’s Palace Museum, which was opened by China’s Republican government to display the vast imperial collection. Curators opted to present the cabbage without its pot, to make it more visually appealing, and it was an instant success with the public after﻿ debuting in 1928.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1930s, amid fears the palace collection would be seized by Japan’s Imperial Army, many of the treasures were evacuated to other cities and spent years on the road, sometimes hidden in temples and caves on the way. After Communist leader Mao Zedong triumphed in the Chinese Civil War, the fleeing Republican forces shipped thousands of crates of artifacts to Taiwan, where they established a new seat for their government.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage was among the almost 700,000 items now forming the collection of Taipei’s National Palace Museum, which opened at its current location in 1965. Three years later, Taiwan’s national postal service issued a  stamp  featuring the cabbage’s image that was printed 3.5 million times, further cementing it in the public imagination.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage is often referred to as one of the institution’s “three treasures,” along with two other popular artifacts — namely the Meat-Shaped Stone, a piece of jasper carved to resemble braised pork belly, and the Mao Kung Ting, a traditional cooking vessel featuring the longest known inscription of ancient characters on any item of Chinese bronzeware.  ﻿ The trio are often collectively described as “pickled cabbage pork hotpot” by tour guides and as a marketing gimmick.\n \n\n   \n  The everydayness of these items may also hold clues to their draw. “The familiar and endearing image of the cabbage instantly creates a connection to the imperial court, which can sometimes feel quite distant and foreign,” wrote Wang Shao-chun, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in a museum journal ﻿earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, despite the Jadeite Cabbage’s popularity among the public, some art historians and museum curators are unfazed. To trained eyes, it is of similar quality to many other realistic jade carvings, which were quite prevalent in the Qing dynasty.\n \n\n   \n  “It is one of the most unique, but not the only great piece of Chinese craftsmanship,” wrote Chang Li-tuan, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in the aforementioned﻿ museum journal.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers also say the lack of written records about the artifact — including information on who commissioned, crafted and owned it — leave the item’s historical context largely unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “There are few historical clues about the piece that allow us to talk about it in-depth,” Hsu said. “Or at least, they have not yet been found.”\n \n\n   \n  This may be why Taiwan’s Ministry of Culture has only designated the cabbage a “significant antiquity,” rather than a full-fledged National Treasure.\n \n\n   \n  “Its popularity and its historical value are clearly unproportional,” Wang told CNN. “Just like movies, a blockbuster may not necessarily be a masterpiece, and vice versa.”\n \n\n   \n  For museum curators, Wang added, the Jadeite Cabbage’s fame is a double-edged sword. “We work hard to promote other great exhibits, but sometimes the only thing on people’s minds is the cabbage. It’s kind of like a singer only remembered for that one hit song.”\n \n\n   \n    Celebrating its centennial\n \n\n   \n  The museum attaches high importance to the security of its most prized artifacts. The Jadeite Cabbage is displayed in a reinforced glass cabinet and held in place by tight strings to protect it from sudden movements — an ever-present threat in earthquake-prone Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  When it travels, it is placed in a dedicated container, which in turn is placed in a wooden box filled with protective packaging. Police and dedicated museum staff typically escort the cabbage to the airport.\n \n\n   \n  It is, however, seldom lent to overseas museums. Prior to this year, the last time the item traveled abroad was in 2014, when it (and the Meat-Shaped Stone) was exhibited in Japan. But loans can sometimes serve as tools of diplomacy. In August, as Taiwan celebrates 100 years since the Palace Museum opened, the Jadeite Cabbage was sent, along with more than 130 artifacts, to the Czech Republic, whose ties with Taiwan have warmed — as its relations with China have deteriorated — in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s ruling Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its own territory despite never having ruled over it, criticized Taipei for engaging in “separatist maneuvers” by facilitating the Czech exhibition, which is on show in the capital Prague through December 31. Taiwanese government and museum   officials rejected the accusation, calling it simply a “cultural exchange.”\n \n\n   \n  In late September, Taiwan’s government said it had received an anonymous email threatening “arson, theft, shootings or terror attacks” if the exhibition continues. In a statement, the National Palace Museum said it was working with Czech authorities to enhance security.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibition remains open, with the Jadeite Cabbage proving to attract Czech visitors.\n \n\n   \n  “It dates from the late 19th century. But it is a perfect example of the highest artistry achievable with jade,” the show’s curator, Ondřej Crhák, told Radio Prague International in September, calling the loan “a rare opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is its first appearance in Europe,” he added. “Given its importance to the National Palace Museum and to Chinese culture, that makes it truly unique.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/ukraine-russia-power-attack-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"02:20:00-05:00","title":"Millions of Ukrainians Face Dark and Cold After One of Russia’s Largest Attacks on Energy Infrastructure","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of Ukrainians are facing extreme cold and widespread darkness after one of Russia’s largest coordinated attacks on energy infrastructure, targeting key regions including Kyiv, Dnipro, Poltava, and Dnipropetrovsk.

temperatures and darkness after a wave of Russian attacks against energy facilities caused widespread power outages across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian authorities have warned that the large scale of the damage means it will take time to restore energy flows. Electricity supplies across the country are being rationed – with people in the capital Kyiv set to be without power for 10-12 hours on Sunday, according to schedules published by energy companies.\n \n\n   \n  Svitlana Grynchuk, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the attack on Saturday was “one of the largest direct ballistic attacks on energy facilities” since the start of the war.\n \n\n   \n  She said that emergency power cuts were implemented across almost all regions to stabilise the network. “We then switched to hourly power cuts, so that consumers could more easily plan their activities around the outages,” Grynchuk said.\n \n\n   \n  The attack over the weekend came just as temperatures in Ukraine began to drop to single digits degrees Celsius. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on numerous occasions since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, usually stepping up attacks around this time of the year.\n \n\n   \n  These frequent disruptions have forced Ukrainians to adapt – diesel generators have become a common sight across the country and people have become accustomed to scheduling their lives around planned outages.\n \n\n   \n  Many families are now scheduling cooking and homework time around the power schedules, and elderly people not leaving their homes in fear of getting stuck without an access to the lift.\n \n\n   \n    Russia strikes when people are asleep\n \n\n   \n  Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack overnight into Saturday, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 civilians have been killed by Russian strikes over the weekend, according to Ukrainian local authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed and 12 injured when a Russian drone struck a nine-story apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.  Video captured  the moment the drone struck in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how I survived, because all the shrapnel flew onto the bed where I was sleeping,” said Larysa, another resident of the building.\n \n\n   \n  “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. People were screaming. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia overnight Saturday, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. Some 450 drones were also launched.\n \n\n   \n  “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs (drones) have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriot air defense systems, which have proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s defense ministry said the strikes had come in response to Ukrainian attacks, and had included Kinzhal ballistic missiles and other weapons in strikes against “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and gas and energy facilities of Ukraine that supported their operations.”\n \n\n   \n  The frequent attacks on energy have seriously damaged Ukrainian gas production. Ukrainian officials have said they’ll have to turn to expensive imports of European gas to make up the shortfall.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the enemy’s plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military and security services  have also stepped up  drone and missile attacks against Russian refineries and other infrastructure such as pipelines and pumping stations in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/climate/south-america-oil-gas-brazil-guyana-argentina-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Welcome to the planet’s newest oil frontier","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South America is rapidly expanding its fossil fuel production, with Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina emerging as key players.

the planet’s newest oil frontier \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Off Brazil’s northeastern coast, where the sediment-heavy water of the vast Amazon River tips out into the Atlantic, are two very different types of treasure. The first is an ecological gem: a 3,600 square-mile  deepwater coral reef  discovered less than a decade ago. The second treasure puts the first in immediate danger. Billions of barrels of oil may lie in the ancient sediments beneath the seabed, and licenses have just been approved to drill there.\n \n\n   \n  A few hundred miles north, off the coast of Guyana, companies are already pumping around 650,000 barrels of oil a day from a huge deep-water reservoir discovered in 2015. The find has transformed this rainforest-carpeted country into the planet’s newest petrostate and highest oil producer per capita.\n \n\n   \n  Several thousand miles inland to the south, the wide, dusty plains of western Argentina’s Vaca Muerta — “dead cow” in English — are dotted with oil wells. Fossil fuel production from this enormous shale deposit has boomed over the past decade, putting it on track to produce  more than a million barrels a day  by 2030, analysts predict.\n \n\n   \n  Welcome to South America’s new oil frontier. “It’s really incredible how fast and how much it’s expanding,” said Nicole Figueiredo de Oliveira, the executive director at environmental non-profit Arayara.\n \n\n   \n  Countries across the region are ramping up extraction but Brazil, Guyana and Argentina are at the forefront —  among the top five drivers  of global oil growth outside of OPEC, the group of major oil exporters.\n \n\n   \n  They are three very different countries: an economic behemoth with an  environment-championing president , a  biodiversity hotspot  with high rates of poverty and an  economically volatile  country led by a  chainsaw-wielding climate denier . Yet they are united in their quest to expand oil production, arguing it’s vital to their economic and social development.\n \n\n   \n  This new fossil fuel boom is happening just as the impacts of the climate crisis — driven by fossil fuels — are beginning to bite in ever more alarming ways. People in South America are dying in  fires ,  floods ,  storms  and  droughts  made longer and more catastrophic by climate change.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s role as  host of the COP30 climate conference , which is supposed to be a landmark summit where countries set out goals to radically reduce planet-heating pollution, adds a particular dissonance to this oil surge.\n \n\n   \n  But as global oil demand stays strong, and other, richer, countries show few signs of scaling back, their argument is: Why shouldn’t oil supply come from South America?\n \n\n   \n  The continent has a long history of fossil fuel extraction; it holds the  second-largest reserves of oil and gas  after the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  Yet it’s one of the few regions that didn’t take advantage of the oil boom at the beginning of this century due to political riskiness and an aversion to private investment, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University. “But that is changing very significantly,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Recent discoveries have stirred excitement, especially as the oil in South America is typically cheaper than average — deepwater sources, in particular, tend to produce large amounts at lower cost — and it also tends emit slightly lower levels of climate pollution per barrel, as it often requires less processing and is produced using newer infrastructure and cleaner energy.\n \n\n   \n  Huge oil companies including Exxon and Chevron have plowed in, seeing dollar signs in South America’s deep oceans and shale fields just as the US shale boom starts to plateau.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil is a superstar: the  region’s largest  oil and gas producer. Production has “reached levels that have never been seen in the region,” Monaldi said. This is in large part due to  ultra-deep “pre-salt” oil reserves  discovered in 2006 buried under thick layers of ancient salt beneath the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  Crude oil became the country’s top export in 2024 for the first time, overtaking soybeans, and there are hopes production will ramp up much further.\n \n\n   \n  In August, BP  announced  it had made its largest oil and gas discovery  in 25 years  off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Farther south, near Uruguay, oil companies hope the Pelotas Basin could be another new frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the most controversial project is the one at the mouth of the Amazon River — the Foz do Amazonas basin — part of what’s known as the “Equatorial Margin,” a stretch of ocean along the northern coast of Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  In June, Brazil  auctioned off  several offshore oil blocks in the region, 19 of which are in the Amazon Basin, to companies including Chevron, Exxon and Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras.\n \n\n   \n  Petrobras has been trying to drill here for many years. In 2023, Brazil’s environmental agency IBAMA  denied  it an offshore drilling license, citing environmental concerns. But last month,   the agency gave the greenlight for exploratory drilling “after a rigorous environmental licensing process,” according to a  statement  from IBAMA.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s task was to assess the “technical feasibility” of the project only, not the political or strategic side of oil exploitation, said a spokesperson for Brazil’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, which oversees IBAMA. Any process involving high-risk areas such as the Foz do Amazonas “must comply with the strictest technical, scientific, and environmental standards,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  The decision “is an achievement of Brazilian society,” said Magda Chambriard, president of Petrobras, in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  Environmental advocates are strongly opposed, arguing drilling in this ecologically delicate swath of ocean, with its unique reefs and huge stretches of mangrove forests, could bring catastrophic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  Ultra-deep water and strong currents mean any oil spill could quickly be swept across miles of ocean and coastline, and the remoteness of the drilling location from large settlements could delay clean-up operations, said Arayara’s Figueiredo de Oliveira.\n \n\n   \n  Approving drilling here mere weeks before the start of COP30 in the city of Belém — known as the gateway to the Amazon — presents tricky optics for Brazil, which is trying to walk a tightrope between environmental champion and fossil fuel power.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s mighty rivers and abundant rains mean  most of its electricity  comes from clean hydroelectric power. Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has presided over a  sharp decline in deforestation  and an increase in renewables.\n \n\n   \n  But Lula has always been pro-oil, Figueiredo de Oliveira said. He greeted Brazil’s big pre-salt discovery, made during his previous presidential term, with the words, “ God is Brazilian .” A famous photo shows him raising oil-drenched hands at a Petrobras event in 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Lula has firmly rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don’t want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he  said  at a COP30 meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible,” to quit oil.\n \n\n   \n  He argues oil wealth can help fund Brazil’s clean energy transition, although some fear the quest to become a major oil power will only delay it. “Every new discovery does set back the effort to move the world off fossil fuels; there’s a loss of momentum,” said Michael Ross, a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps Lula’s main narrative  is that oil revenues will provide a route to development and a pathway out of poverty, especially for the country’s poorer Amazon states. But Brazil is already a powerhouse “with many other economic opportunities,” Ross told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The argument oil is vital for development may be easier to make in a country like Guyana, where  around 48%  live on less than $5.50 a day, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  Guyana, which has a similar geology to Brazil’s Equatorial Margin, is experiencing a remarkable oil boom. The 2015 offshore   discovery “represents one of the most transformative milestones” in the country’s modern history, said President Irfaan Ali.\n \n\n   \n  It has transformed the nation of around 820,000 people into the  world’s fastest expanding economy . “We have never seen a country produce so many barrels per capita in the history of (the region)… they belong now in the category of the countries of the Middle East,” Monaldi said.\n \n\n   \n  The government has insisted it can balance oil exploitation with environmental priorities. Guyana is one of the few countries that stores more planet-heating pollution than it produces due to its vast rainforests. It also says that revenues will boost socioeconomic growth.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not see a contradiction between the responsible development of our oil and gas sector and our commitment to protecting the planet’s climate,” Ali told CNN. Both are “integral parts of a single national mission” to cut poverty, boost the economy and protect the environment, he said.\n \n\n   \n  But there are concerns Guyana could fall victim to the “resource curse,” in which huge windfalls can make life worse for those who live there. Venezuela, for example, holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, and has descended into authoritarianism and economic crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Ali insists the resource curse “is not destiny” and oil wealth will translate into “benefits for every household.” Yet some residents say they face  sky- high living costs  they blame on oil development, and the country’s health outcomes remain below the regional average, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  South American oil is not just about deep water. Argentina’s huge shale region, Vaca Muerta, often compared to the Permian Basin in Texas, holds the world’s second largest reserves of shale gas and fourth largest of shale oil.\n \n\n   \n  It’s Argentina’s big hope for economic recovery under libertarian President Javier Milei. “Almost everything is about expanding Vaca Muerta,” said Gabriel Blanco, a professor in the Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Central Buenos Aires and former national director of climate change in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Oil and gas are a very easy sell domestically, Blanco told CNN. Climate change has “never ever” been on the public or political agenda, he said. Instead, “the narrative says that we are going to be rich and we’re going to develop.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaca Muerta is an attractive proposition for fossil fuel companies. Shale is a very different type of investment than deep-water drilling, Monaldi said. Companies can spend relatively small amounts to see if they can recover their money before putting in more. This encourages investment in Argentina, a country with “high political and regulatory risk,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But environmental experts fear the impacts of this booming shale field. Fossil fuels are extracted by “fracking,” a process that involves drilling into the Earth and injecting fluids at high pressure. “They use a lot of water, they use a lot of sand and chemicals, and so it’s a mess,” Blanco said.\n \n\n   \n  Exactly how South America’s oil future will unfold is not yet clear. New discoveries in Brazil may turn out to be less viable than hoped. For projects already drilling and pumping, reserves often run out earlier than anticipated, UCLA’s Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  Oil demand is also predicted to peak at the start of the next decade, which could mean countries that go hard on fossil fuels will find themselves locked into an unprofitable industry. “These countries are getting to the party right as the bar is closing,” Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  For now, however, demand remains. “While there’s still a gap between current production and demand, there will be investment into new projects,” said Flávio Ferreira Menten, an analyst at the research firm Rystad Energy.\n \n\n   \n  There are geopolitical considerations, too. If US oil production doesn’t keep growing, South America “becomes much more important,” Monaldi said, otherwise the world risks becoming reliant on countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  What’s happening in South America is reflective of something bigger, according to Blanco. The region’s love affair with fossil fuels is part of a global movement, he said: an implicit — and sometimes explicit — consensus that oil exploitation can and should continue for decades to come even in the face of a barreling climate crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like leaders decided to step strongly on the on the gas pedal and move forward with fossil fuels everywhere,” he said, “no matter what.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/asia/philippines-typhoon-fung-wong-uwan-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"02:26:00-04:00","title":"More than 1.4 million evacuated as second typhoon in a week slams into the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, struck the Philippines in early November 2025, following the deadly Typhoon Kalmaegi, which killed 188 people.

than 1.4 million evacuated as second typhoon in a week slams into the Philippines \n       \n  By Laura Sharman, Caitlin Danaher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:26 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Typhoon Fung-wong triggered floods and landslides, cut power to entire provinces and killed at least ﻿four people, including two children, before barreling out of the Philippines on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan,   follows on the heels of  Typhoon Kalmaegi , which killed almost 200 people in the central part of the archipelago nation, as well as five people in Vietnam.    \n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead the typhoon making landfall on Sunday night, according to the Office of Civil Defense. Fung-wong slammed into the coastal municipality of Dinalungan, on the main island of Luzon, with sustained winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph).\n \n\n   \n  A mudslide buried a house and killed two children in the town of Kayapa in central Luzon, regional civil defense official Alvin Ayson told Reuters news agency Monday.\n \n\n   \n  They followed the deaths of   two people  —  one who   drowned in Catanduanes province and a woman who died after being trapped under the debris of a collapsed home in Catbalogan City, according to the civil defense.\n \n\n   \n  The storm, with a footprint that spanned nearly the entirety of the archipelago, lost strength as it swept through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight, before heading into the South China Sea toward Taiwan, according to the Philippines’ weather agency PAGASA.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is now bracing for Fung-wong, with school closures announced in parts of the eastern county of Hualien, and evacuation orders issued in flood and landslide-prone areas, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Dramatic video from the Philippines showed rescuers braving strong winds and homes submerged in water as recovery efforts continued overnight into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Drone footage from Reuters showed vast areas of flooded farmlands in Nueva Ecija province, while other videos showed massive waves crashing into the Catanduanes coastline, flooded streets, and water surging into a building in Aurora province, while families queued for food in shelters.\n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million residents took emergency shelter at gymnasiums, theaters and relatives’ homes before the typhoon hit, with 318,000 remaining in evacuation centers on Monday, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “We could not sleep because of the winds hitting our metal sheets and tree branches falling,” Romeo Mariano, who sheltered with his grandmother at home in Isabela province, told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  “When we got out to check our home, we saw the damage.”\n \n\n   \n  Filomina Mariano, a 69-year-old resident in Santiago City told Reuters: “I was not able to sleep last night. I told my grandchildren to pray for our safety. I was just sitting the whole night waiting for the storm to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Around 1,000 houses were damaged in the storm, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) said, adding that some homes remain blocked by landslides and rescuers are working to reach them once conditions improve Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “While the typhoon has passed, its rains still pose a danger in certain areas in northern Luzon, including in metropolitan Manila,” Alejandro said. “We’ll undertake today rescue, relief and disaster-response operations.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 130 northern villages were flooded, with residents in at least one community trapped on their roofs as floodwaters rapidly rose, according to the Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  “People are a little shellshocked,” Butch Meily, president of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), told CNN, noting this marks the country’s fourth major typhoon, in addition to  two earthquakes , within the past seven weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Recovery efforts were interrupted in Kalmaegi-stricken Cebu and Davao to the south ﻿ , to concentrate all available resources on Fung-wong, including a 24-hour operation center near the capital Manila, said Meily of the PDRF, a major private-sector coordinator for disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  “But our funds are starting to get exhausted because of the number of emergencies,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  At its height, the typhoon’s massive circulation spanned 1,800 km — enough to cover the entire country, PAGASA weather specialist Benison Estareja told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected damage from Fung-wong.\n \n\n   \n  More than 325 domestic and 61 international flights were canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in ports after the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas, AP reported. About 3 million people were left without power on Sunday, according to Philippines News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  While the Philippines has not requested international aid after Kalmaegi, officials said the US and Japan are prepared to assist, and authorities have ordered schools and most government offices to close until Wednesday, according to AP.\n \n\n   \n    No pause for relief\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons, and Fung-wong is the 21st named storm to impact the country this year, according to local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Its predecessor Kalmaegi left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines on Tuesday, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people.

way for the government to reopen \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:05 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Enough Democrats caved.\n \n\n   \n  A Sunday night Senate deal may be on the verge of resolving the longest government shutdown on record — after a group of moderate Democrats dropped their key demand — a guaranteed extension of Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement opened the way for a Senate vote in which eight Democratic defectors  voted to break the filibuster  and to clear the first hurdle to reopening the government after nearly six weeks. Their move will offer relief to millions of Americans whose lives have been severely disrupted by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But the compromise was opposed by some key party leaders and is already igniting a firestorm of protests from progressives who accuse their more moderate colleagues of disastrously backing down, handing President Donald Trump a victory and turning their backs on millions of Americans who can’t afford  spiking health care premiums .  \n \n\n   \n  “I will not support a deal that does nothing to make health care more affordable,” Democratic Sen Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive, wrote on X. “We are in a health care emergency. … A vote for this bill is a mistake.”\n \n\n   \n  It might be crass to parse the human misery caused by the shutdown for a partisan win after a political duel that deprived millions of Americans of  food benefits , left federal workers with $0 paychecks, and created chaos and safety fears in  commercial aviation .\n \n\n   \n  But the crisis — precipitated by the expiration of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans,  whose prices are skyrocketing  — was fought for multilayered political reasons. It will influence judgments on Trump’s second presidency and the Republican majorities in Congress and help define the trajectory of the Democratic Party’s comeback bid ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The deal sets a date for a vote in the Senate on ACA subsidies in December, but falls well short of cementing their extension. It funds the government through January 30 and guarantees pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown and those who worked without pay. It also reverses Trump’s firing of federal employees throughout the impasse and funds  food stamps  through 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Once the package works through procedural steps in the Senate, the Republican-led House must be recalled to vote on the measure.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘political disaster’\n \n\n   \n  The headline here is that sufficient numbers of Democrats are folding without achieving the goal that led them to withhold votes from a government funding bill and halt federal operations at the beginning of October.\n \n\n   \n  On the face of it, this looks like a massive failure. Democrats won no undertaking that Obamacare subsidies will be extended — despite insisting that such a move was their bottom line. The best they will get is a Senate vote. There is no guarantee that a bill extending subsidies will pass, considering the Senate’s GOP majority. And the prospects of the Republican House endorsing it seem even more remote.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader who sits as an independent but votes with Democrats, said the compromise risked “a policy and political disaster.” He added before the Senate vote: “My own thought is that it would be a horrific mistake to cave in to Trump right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Many leading Democrats  argued their party’s big wins  in elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City last week were attributable to the effective way their candidates lacerated Trump over  the cost of living .\n \n\n   \n  Now, at the first chance they got to put that lesson into practice — fighting for the affordability of health care — they gave up, even though polls showed most  voters blame Trump  for the shutdown and agree with the Democratic position.\n \n\n   \n  The blowback could be severe, exposing deep divisions in the party that may show the “big tent” that leaders kept citing in the aftermath of last week’s election victories may be more viable in theory than in practice.\n \n\n   \n  There were many unhappy Democrats inside and outside the Senate. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego warned he would not turn his back on Americans seeing their premiums sharply rise as he voted no on the resolution. “At a time when prices are already too high, Americans are shopping for health insurance and experiencing such sticker shock that they are being forced to sign up for a crappy, overpriced plan or not signing up for insurance at all,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, did not vote for the deal. But Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the party’s No. 2 leader in the chamber, who is retiring next year and is therefore shielded from a left-wing backlash, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  Another Democrat who voted for the deal, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, represents thousands of federal workers and welcomed the move to reverse firings during the shutdown. He also argued that the Senate vote on extending the enhanced subsidies would put the GOP on the spot. “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   \n    A more pragmatic view of the Democratic concessions\n \n\n   \n  Still, assessments of the break in the deadlock that came on Day 40 of the shutdown must also factor in whether the Democrats’ demand was achievable in the first place and whether the deepening pain of the shutdown, which is fast becoming a national crisis, was about to make their position unsustainable.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat who opposed the shutdown all along, warned his party might overplay its hand by carrying on. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,” Fetterman told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, dealing with intense fury over Trump’s bulldozing presidency among their base, and disillusionment over the party’s disastrous 2024 election loss, had no real political option but to fight — even if it was obvious that securing an extension to Obamacare subsidies might be unattainable.\n \n\n   \n  The party may accrue some political benefits for forcing Trump into the longest-ever shutdown. Multiple polls showed more Americans blamed him and his party at a time when his  approval ratings  are dipping into the kind of steep slump second-term presidents struggle to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the shutdown, Trump, a billionaire surrounded by a Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires, seemed indifferent to the daily struggles of millions of Americans. It was easy for Democrats to portray him as cruel as his administration fought court orders to restore funding to food assistance for 42 million Americans. While Trump is pledging to talk more about affordability, that is an impression that might stick.\n \n\n   \n  And there is an unpalatable truth that some progressives prefer not to contemplate. Democrats have almost no power in Washington. They’ve used their only leverage — the capacity to withhold their votes in the Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation — to frustrate a president who gets almost no pushback. That’s not nothing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemed quite willing to allow the pain and anxiety of the shutdown to deepen for millions of Americans. He was implicitly daring Democrats to pick the suffering of one set of millions of Americans over the duress being experienced by millions more. With the president refusing to negotiate, it was incumbent on Democrats to consider whether the cost of carrying on was justified.\n \n\n   \n  Progressives are already dismayed about what many will see as a humiliating climbdown by Senate moderates. But another lesson from Democratic wins in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races last week was that moderate candidates racked up big victory margins. A pragmatic view of the shutdown as it stood on Sunday was that as the fast-worsening consequences became clear — with Thanksgiving travel chaos looming — Democrats may have risked losing their incremental political gains if public opinion swung against them as well as the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  In that sense, the classic building of pressure that historically ends up forcing the reopening of the government — namely that political damage caused by carrying on is outweighed by the advantage of staying shut down — did its work again, albeit belatedly.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said in a statement after voting to support the compromise deal.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the recriminations, there’s no doubt Democrats succeeded in highlighting a core issue — the exploding cost of health care — which the GOP seems to have no viable plan to tackle.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown has not changed this issue: The health care system is broken, people may lose insurance, and Republicans may end up with the blame if they don’t fix it, since they are the party in power.\n \n\n   \n    Trump didn’t cave, but he may have badly damaged his brand anyway\n \n\n   \n  Given the exhausting pace of the Trump presidency, and the multiple controversies unfolding at once under the chaos agent in the White House, it seems unlikely a shutdown now will play a major role in influencing the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may have gotten what he wanted.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout his presidency, business career and life, Trump has always tried to impose personal leverage. His self-image as a winner who doesn’t give into pressure will exit the shutdown intact. Trump was determined not bend to Democrats employing the kind of hardline tactics he so often uses himself. And he didn’t. The president warned that he wouldn’t negotiate on health care with the government closed. And he held firm.\n \n\n   \n  But the political cost wrought by his actions over the last 40 days could be considerable. He often looked callous, as though unconcerned about the real pain inflicted by the shutdown. After all, he went to the Supreme Court to try to overturn a court order requiring him to pay food stamp benefits. And when the deal was struck in the Senate on Sunday night, he was absent — after attending a Washington Commanders NFL game and spending the weekend at his luxury resort in Florida, reinforcing an impression he doesn’t care about the economic concerns of regular Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And Republicans are still not off the hook on the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. GOP leaders now face the question of whether they are willing to let them expire, in a scenario that could put health care out of reach for millions of people. This seems an unsustainable political position in the run-up to midterm elections, and the issue is set to only gain in traction as the end of the year looms.\n \n\n   \n  And bitter divisions in the GOP — most graphically exemplified during the shutdown by  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene , with her scathing criticism of her party’s dearth of ideas on health care — are likely to burst open when the House returns from its weekslong absence, and will again test the authority of Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown drama also revealed rare signs that Trump’s authority over his own party isn’t absolute on Capitol Hill. Republican senators ignored his demands to  abolish the filibuster  that requires most bills to get 60 votes in the chamber. Such a move would have given Trump almost unlimited power to use GOP majorities to transform the nation over the next year.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP senators feared what any Democratic majority might do in the absence of the filibuster. Their position was a nod to a future in which Trump is not the dominant GOP figure, underscoring that lame-duck status may beckon even for a president who has shattered almost every convention of his office.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/sport/baseball-mlb-guardians-emmanuel-clase-luis-ortiz","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"10:36:00-05:00","title":"Feds Indict 2 Cleveland Guardians Pitchers for Alleged Sports Betting and Money Laundering Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz have been indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on multiple counts, including wire fraud, bribery, and money laundering, for allegedly rigging bets on MLB games by providing inside information about pitches.

alleged sports betting and money laundering scheme \n       \n  By Kevin Dotson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:36 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Cleveland Guardians’ pitchers  Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz  have been indicted for allegedly taking part in a scheme to rig bets placed on  Major League Baseball  games.\n \n\n   \n  Clase and Ortiz face charges on multiple counts of wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, money laundering conspiracy and more, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “Ortiz was arrested earlier today in Boston, Massachusetts, and will make an initial appearance in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts on November 10,” said Joseph Nocella, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\n \n\n   \n  “Clase is currently not in U.S. custody,” Nocella added.\n \n\n   \n  A lawyer for Ortiz maintains his client’s innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning,”   attorney Chris Georgalis told CNN in an email. “Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s attorney, Michael J. Ferrara, also told CNN that his client is “innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.”\n \n\n   \n  “Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,” Ferrara added.\n \n\n   \n  Both players were placed on non-disciplinary leave during the 2025 MLB season in relation to a sports betting probe.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the recent law enforcement action,” the Guardians tell CNN. “We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.”\n \n\n   \n  Major League Baseball says it has also been cooperating with the DOJ investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process,” a league spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges “the defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators on specific pitches that they would throw in MLB games. The co-conspirators then used that information to place hundreds of fraudulent bets on those pitches.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s involvement in the scheme is alleged to have started in 2023. The three-time All-Star coordinated with corrupt sports bettors to rig proposition bets on particular pitches he would throw, prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The bettors would then wager on the speed and type of Clase’s pitches, based on information they received in advance from Clase, sometimes even during games, per the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ says bettors won at least $400,000 using inside information on Clase’s pitches.\n \n\n   \n  Ortiz is accused of joining the enterprise in 2025, working alongside Clase to coordinate with bettors on rigged pitches he would throw.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Ortiz was paid a total of $12,000 to intentionally throw a ball instead of a strike in two MLB games. Clase allegedly received matching payments for his role in helping to arrange Ortiz’s rigged pitches, the feds say, with gamblers winning at least $60,000 in the process.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment, which was filed on Wednesday and unsealed Sunday, comes on the heels of a series of  similar indictments  involving Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones.\n \n\n   \n  The trio was arrested in October in relation to two separate federal gambling investigations, one involving rigged high-stakes poker games and the other involving insider trading in sports betting.\n \n\n   \n  Both the MLB and NBA cases are being handled by Nocella’s Brooklyn office.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted of all charges, Clase and Ortiz could potentially face decades behind bars.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Amanda Musa contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/coal-mine-flood-accident-west-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:28:00-05:00","title":"Flood Traps Coal Miner in West Virginia Mine","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A flood in the Rolling Thunder coal mine near Drennen, West Virginia, has trapped a miner, following the breach of an old mine wall that allowed an unknown pocket of water to enter.

Tagliabue, who helped bring labor peace and riches to the  NFL  during his 17 years as  commissioner  but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure at 84 years old.\n \n\n   \n  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue’s family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson’s disease, was commissioner after Pete Rozelle from 1989 to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue.\n \n\n   \n  “Paul was the ultimate steward of the game — tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL,” Goodell said in a statement. “I am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league’s bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages.\n \n\n   \n  During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the “Rooney Rule,” in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.\n \n\n   \n  When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue certainly had his detractors, notably over concussions. The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma.\n \n\n   \n  In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn’t have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions “one of those pack-journalism issues” and contended the number of concussions “is relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously,” he said on Talk of Fame Network, “I do regret those remarks. Looking back, it was not sensible language to use to express my thoughts at the time. My language was intemperate, and it led to serious misunderstanding. I overreacted on issues which we were already working on. But that doesn’t excuse the overreaction and intemperate language.\n \n\n   \n  “Bottom line, it sounded like I was shooting the messenger, which was the concussion issue. My intention at the time was to make a point which could have been made fairly simply: that there was a need for better data. There was a need for more reliable information about concussions and uniformity in terms of how they were being defined in terms of severity.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue is survived by his wife Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/usda-pauses-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"USDA Orders States to Stop Issuing Full SNAP Benefits and to 'Undo' Benefits Sent for November","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ordered states to cease issuing full SNAP benefits for November 2025 and to reverse any prior full benefit payments, following a Supreme Court ruling by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that temporarily paused a lower court order requiring the USDA to fund full benefits.

states to stop issuing full SNAP benefits and to ‘undo’ benefits sent for November \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Aileen Graef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:07 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay Americans their full assistance.\n \n\n   \n  In the  Saturday directive , obtained by CNN, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits — which will provide 65% of the maximum allotments for November — as ordered by the same lower court judge earlier in the week. (Many recipients will receive  less than 65% of their usual assistance  because of the way food stamp benefits are calculated.)\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  The latest guidance follows   a memorandum  from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day.\n \n\n   \n  Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n    Legal battles\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover  full food stamp benefits , siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month.\n \n\n   \n  His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n    Providing full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.”\n \n\n   \n  In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604681","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:04:00-05:00","title":"Trump floats tariff 'dividends' even while plan shows major flaws","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has promoted a $2,000 'dividend' for middle and lower-income Americans, funded by tariff revenue, despite experts warning that the plan would cost significantly more than the revenue it generates, potentially increasing national debt.

'dividends' even while plan shows major flaws \n         By Danielle Kurtzleben  \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:04 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump has bragged many times about the revenue tariffs are bringing in — money paid by American businesses, who pass some of the costs on to consumers. Over the weekend, Trump  pushed the idea  of paying that money back to Americans, in the form of $2,000 payments. The idea is in no way a detailed proposal, but what Trump has said about it presents multiple steep challenges for the administration: the plan may cost far more than Trump is saying, and Trump's rhetoric around tariff revenue may undermine his administration's pro-tariff arguments at the Supreme Court. In addition, his administration is already saying that the plan won't even involve direct payments to taxpayers, even while Trump continues to push that notion. Trump summarized much of what he's said about his tariff rebate plan speaking with reporters on Monday. \"We're going to issue a dividend to our middle income people and lower income people of about $2,000,\" he said. \"And we're going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt.\" While details are scant,  budget experts  are  already saying  that there just isn't enough money for this idea. \"Even with the most conservative estimates applied to it, it doesn't work,\" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. By her math, if the rebates went to people making under $100,000 per year, that would cost way more than the amount of revenue tariffs will bring in. \"So you'll see at least a $100 billion gap there between what we can expect the tariffs to generate for the U.S. government versus what the president is promising to spend on tariff rebates for American citizens.\" She added that even if the money went out only to people making $75,000 or less annually, there still wouldn't be enough revenue, by her calculations. In other words, the proposal could add to the debt — the opposite of what Trump said he wanted it to do. \"To me, this seems less of a thought out policy proposal and more of, 'A $2,000 check sounds good. People are struggling with affordability. They're tired of inflation. What can I say to make them think I'm trying to do something?'\" York said. Then again, the White House is already saying the plan might not involve a straightforward check or payment sent to taxpayers, like the stimulus money during the height of COVID. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC's  This Week  on Sunday that voters might receive the money in the form of tax cuts that Congress  already passed  earlier this year. \"The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms,\" Bessent said. \"It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. You know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security.\" NPR asked the White House for additional details on the plan.  \"The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,\" said a White House official not authorized to speak on the record. Talking about revenues puts the Trump administration in a tricky position right now. Just last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments against some of Trump's tariffs, with tariff opponents saying Congress — not the president — has the power to levy taxes. In response, administration lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that revenues aren't the point of the tariffs. \"These are regulatory tariffs,\" Solicitor General John Sauer said to the justices. \"They are not revenue-raising tariffs. The fact that they raise revenue is only incidental.\" Asked on Sunday to square that argument with Trump's revenue talk, Bessent said the tariffs are ultimately meant to bring businesses back into the U.S. No matter what, Congress would have to authorize any payments. And even if the government were open, it's not a given that would happen. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/government-shutdown-reopen-deal-senate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:57:00.000-05:00","title":"Senate Advances Deal to Reopen Government After Centrist Democrats Strike Major Deal to End Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate advanced a bipartisan deal to end a 40-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, by approving a stopgap funding measure that extends operations until January 30, 2025.

It includes no guarantee from Republicans to extend the health care subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  What Democrats did secure is a future vote on the matter. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the chamber floor Sunday that he will hold a vote on a measure to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits by the middle of next month. Democrats involved in the talks believe that will give enough time for House and Senate GOP leaders to negotiate a true compromise in the coming weeks, though it would be a major lift to get through a Republican-controlled Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the outrage from the rest of the Senate Democratic Caucus, GOP leaders are determined to move the funding measure quickly through Congress and to President Donald Trump’s desk in the coming days. Once Trump has signed it into law, it’s still not clear how quickly agencies can restore services for the tens of millions of Americans  facing shutdown pain , from the loss of federal food aid to child care closures to delayed paychecks. Senate GOP leaders have not yet scheduled a final passage vote.\n \n\n   \n  “I am optimistic that after almost six weeks of this shutdown, we’ll finally be able to end it,” Thune declared from the Senate floor on Day 40 of the funding lapse.\n \n\n   \n  An exasperated Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado voted no on the deal but argued that his colleagues who supported it did not “cave” and instead were doing “what they feel is helping the most number of people.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no good solution,” Hickenlooper said, adding that some of his colleagues believe Trump will “stop at nothing to prevent that subsidy from being restored.” He added: “I voted no just because … piss off, I’m just frustrated. We tried it and now we’re going to use every other tool. We’re not going to quit.”\n \n\n   \n  Once the Senate has given final approval to the funding measure, it heads to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must muscle the deal through a fractious GOP conference — likely with help from Trump himself. It’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson with that job.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government say Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending the Obamacare subsidies forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  They believe that Democrats have an upper hand on the issue of health care and that a separate health care vote will spotlight the differences between the two parties, even though it has little chance of becoming law. And they’re not ruling out another shutdown showdown in January, when the next tranche of funding expires (though critical programs such as food aid and WIC will already be funded, to lessen the pain for millions of Americans).\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a retiring Democrat from New Hampshire, said Republicans made clear repeatedly over recent months that “this was the only deal on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether Democrats would willing to vote down the next funding measure on January 30 if Congress fails to deliver a health care fix by then, Shaheen said: “That’s certainly an option that everybody will consider.”\n \n\n   \n  The deal, which has been in the works for the last five weeks, came together between three former governors — Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire — along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House. Details of the deal were first reported by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of those Democrats involved is Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents thousands of federal workers in Virginia and who said he supports the GOP’s promise for a future vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said of GOP senators who choose not to support extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  And importantly for Kaine, Democrats also secured an agreement from the White House to reverse its mass firings of federal workers during the shutdown, as well as protections against them happening the rest of this fiscal year. It also guarantees all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But inside the Democratic Party, the funding deal has exposed a deep divide. Liberal senators were fuming at their colleagues for backing the deal, with House Democratic leaders vowing to “fight” the deal in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic leadership was split on the vote, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opposing the deal while his No. 2, retiring Sen. Dick Durbin, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  But some liberal senators have fiercely opposed the plan, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s no deal without health care,” Blumenthal said, voicing a widespread sentiment in the Democratic caucus. “So far as I’m concerned, health care isn’t included, and so I’ll be a no.”\n \n\n   \n  Even some centrist-leaning Democrats, like Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, voiced concerns with the idea on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “I was involved for many weeks, and then over the last couple of weeks, it changed — last week it changed,” Slotkin said, noting that she was no longer involved in talks in recent days. “But I always said, like, it’s got to do something concrete on health care, and it’s hard to see how that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Across the Capitol, House Democratic leaders sharply condemned the deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus “will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” adding: “We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives.”\n \n\n   \n  One member, Rep. Ro Khanna of California,  took to X  on Sunday night calling for Schumer to be replaced. “Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” Khanna wrote.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats plan to have their own caucus huddle on Monday, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture. That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The next step after Sunday night’s vote is a vote on the full measure, which includes the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate would first vote to take up the House-passed stopgap measure, which means eight Democrats would need to support it for it to advance. Then, the Senate would amend that bill with the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who has voted on the GOP funding plan throughout the shutdown and criticized his own party’s stance, said Sunday that it is time to ”take the win.”\n \n\n   \n  Vote yes, he said, “and then we can find a way to lower our costs about health care.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/health/byheart-infant-formula-outbreak-positive-bacteria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:15:00Z","title":"Preliminary Tests Find Germ That Causes Botulism in ByHeart Baby Formula","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preliminary tests have found bacteria that produces the toxin linked to infant botulism in a sample of ByHeart baby formula, raising public health concerns.

formula \n       \n  Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:15 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Preliminary tests showed that ByHeart baby formula contained the type of bacteria that produces the toxin linked to  a botulism outbreak , California health officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The outbreak has sickened at least 13 infants in 10 states. No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers in possession of this product should stop using it immediately,” the California Department of Public Health said in a statement late Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  More tests of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula are pending as state and federal health officials investigate the outbreak that started in mid-August. The New York-based company this weekend recalled two lots of the powdered product.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism outbreak\n \n\n   \n  The outbreak of infant botulism has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. All were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  The cases occurred in Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials agreed to recall two lots of the company’s Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The formula has a best-by date of December 2026.\n \n\n   \n  California health officials tested a can of the powdered formula that was fed to a baby who fell ill. The results “suggest the presence” of the type of bacteria that produces the botulism toxin confirmed in other cases. It can take several days to confirm the results.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials said that “more testing is needed” to know whether the type of bacteria that causes botulism is present. It comes from a large family of bacteria, many of which are found naturally in the environment and don’t cause illness, the company said.\n \n\n   \n  “We take this very seriously,” it said in a statement Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA is investigating reports of 83 cases of infant botulism reported since August including the cases linked to Byheart baby formula.\n \n\n   \n    Causes of infant botulism\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacteria that produces toxins in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.\n \n\n   \n  Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable and can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel “floppy” and can have problems swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.\n \n\n   \n  “This would be extremely rare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism treatment\n \n\n   \n  The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.\n \n\n   \n  All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential impact on U.S. formula supplies\n \n\n   \n  There is no danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  That’s different that the crisis caused when formula produced by Abbott was linked to infant deaths and illnesses in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  That product was contaminated with a different germ that can cause severe illness and death in babies. Because Abbott is one of the top manufacturers of infant formula in the U.S., the closure of its manufacturing plant in Michigan triggered massive shortages of formula across the U.S.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company’s packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing “areas that still require corrective actions.”\n \n\n   \n    Reviewing infant formula ingredients\n \n\n   \n  Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul  the U.S. food supply  and are taking a new look at  infant formula .\n \n\n   \n  Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the Food and Drug Administration  to review  the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, dubbed “Operation Stork Speed,” is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.\n \n\n   \n  FDA officials are reviewing comments from industry, health experts and public to decide next steps.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604157","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:08:00Z","title":"Flesh wins 2025 Booker Prize: 'We had never read anything quite like it'","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Szalay's novel 'Flesh' has won the 2025 Booker Prize, praised for its innovative use of narrative white space and for its exploration of a quiet character, István, whose life reflects the cultural and economic divides between Hungary and England.

He was 88.\n \n\n   \n  The family said Wilkens was surrounded by loved ones when he died and did not immediately release a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was one of the finest point guards of his era who later brought his calm and savvy style to the sideline, first as a player-coach and then evolving into one of the game’s great coaches.\n \n\n   \n  He coached 2,487 games in the NBA, which is still a record. He became a Hall of Famer as a player, as a coach and again as part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team — on which he was an assistant. Wilkens coached the Americans to gold at the Atlanta Games as well in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  “Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA — as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game’s most respected ambassadors,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Sunday. “So much so that, four years ago, Lenny received the unique distinction of being named one of the league’s 75 greatest players and 15 greatest coaches of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was a nine-time All-Star as a player, was the first person to reach 1,000 wins as an NBA coach and was the second person inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He coached the Seattle SuperSonics to the NBA title in 1979 and remained iconic in that city for the rest of his life, often being considered a godfather of sorts for basketball in Seattle — which lost the Sonics to Oklahoma City in 2008 and has been trying to get a team back since.\n \n\n   \n  And he did it all with grace, something he was proud of.\n \n\n   \n  “Leaders don’t yell and scream,” Wilkens told Seattle’s KOMO News earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens, the 1994 NBA coach of the year with Atlanta, retired with 1,332 coaching wins — a league record that was later passed by Don Nelson (who retired with 1,335) and then Gregg Popovich (who retired with 1,390).\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens played 15 seasons with the St. Louis Hawks, SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers. He was an All-Star five times with St. Louis, three times in Seattle and once with Cleveland in 1973 at age 35. A statue depicting his time with the SuperSonics was installed outside  Climate Pledge Arena  in June.\n \n\n   \n  “Even more impressive than Lenny’s basketball accomplishments, which included two Olympic gold medals and an NBA championship, was his commitment to service — especially in his beloved community of Seattle where a statue stands in his honor,” Silver said. “He influenced the lives of countless young people as well as generations of players and coaches who considered Lenny not only a great teammate or coach but also an extraordinary mentor who led with integrity and true class.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens twice led the league in assists but was also a prominent scorer. He averaged in double figures scoring in every season of his career, except his final one in 1974-75 with the Trail Blazers. His best season as a scorer came in his first season with the SuperSonics in 1968-69 when he averaged 22.4 points, 8.2 assists and 6.2 rebounds.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Wilkens was born on Oct. 28, 1937, in New York. His basketball schooling came on Brooklyn’s playgrounds and at a city powerhouse, then Boys High School, where one of his teammates was major league baseball star Tommy Davis. He would go on to star at Providence and was drafted by the Hawks as the sixth overall pick in 1960.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604664","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-05:00","title":"Trump slams air traffic controllers who called out during the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, air traffic controllers faced a crisis of staffing and compensation, working without pay for over 40 days despite the risks and stress involved.

called out during the government shutdown \n         By Joe Hernandez \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 3:19 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump is slamming U.S. air traffic controllers who called out of work during the government shutdown, during which they were forced to stay on the job without pay. Trump said in a  post on Truth Social  Monday morning that he was \"NOT HAPPY\" with controllers who took time off. \"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn't will be substantially 'docked,'\" he wrote. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Federal Aviation Administration had been contending with a shortage of air traffic controllers since well before the shutdown began, but the crisis deepened when the government closed and controllers received a partial paycheck and then no pay at all.. Some have taken on second jobs, while others have called in sick. Controllers are set to miss their second full paycheck this week. In a statement to NPR, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said, \"This nation's air traffic controllers have been working without pay for over 40 days. The vast majority of these highly trained and skilled professionals continue to perform one of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world, despite not being compensated. Many are working six-day weeks and ten-hour days without any pay.\" \"These unsung heroes, who report for duty to safely guide this country's passengers and cargo to their destinations, deserve our praise. They have certainly earned it.\" Meanwhile, Trump called controllers who took no time off during the longest shutdown in U.S. history \"GREAT PATRIOTS\" and said he would recommend giving them each a $10,000 bonus. He said any controllers who wanted to quit shouldn't hesitate, but would receive \"NO payment or severance of any kind!\" and would be \"quickly replaced by true Patriots.\" (In fact, one reason for the shortage is that  it takes years to train and certify  new controllers.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a subsequent  post on X , Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy praised \"those who have worked throughout the shutdown\" and said he would work with Congress to \"reward your commitment.\" Others offered sharp criticism of Trump's comments. \"The President wouldn't last five minutes as an air traffic controller,\" former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg  said in a post on X , \"and after everything they've been through - and the way this administration has treated them from Day One - he has no business s****ing on them now.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last week, the  FAA announced  it would reduce flights by up to 10% at 40 of the busiest airports in the country, starting with a 4% reduction put in place on Friday. That contributed to major travel headaches over the weekend. There were more than 4,500 cancellations and 18,000 delays at airports across the U.S., according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. At Philadelphia International Airport, Phill Hicks' flight to West Palm Beach, Fla., was canceled and rebooked twice on Sunday. He was preparing to head home for the night and return for his flight Monday morning, but wasn't confident that would take off either. \"I don't believe this ticket,\" he told NPR, \"but I'm going to gas my truck up, and take that trip if I have to.\" Seth Alpert's flight back to Columbus, Ohio, was delayed by two hours. Hedging his bets, he rented a car just in case. \"We'll see. The incoming flight says it's on time, or a few minutes delayed so, you know, 50-50,\" Alpert said of his chances. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hicks, who was stuck at the airport several hours before  senators announced they had reached a potential deal  to reopen the government, said Congress should be working harder to end the shutdown. \"I think little cry babies need to get together and figure it out,\" he said. \"People elect them to do a job.

Winner's Curse' \n         By Greg Rosalsky \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 6:30 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Back in the 1980s, a young economist — and future Nobel winner — named Richard Thaler began writing a series of columns that challenged the dominant doctrine of his field. At the time, most of the economics profession was smitten with a cartoonish picture of human behavior. A depiction of humans as selfish, smart, calculating, and self-controlled creatures who optimally choose what's best for themselves. It had become a bedrock of the mathematical models economists used to describe — and sometimes glorify — the free market. Thaler rejected this model of human behavior. He pioneered the field of behavioral economics, which has sought to enrich our understanding of markets and the world by incorporating insights from psychology and other fields about how human beings actually behave. And this series of columns, published in an academic journal named the  Journal of Economic Perspectives , was a sort of opening salvo for this revolution. In column after column, Thaler shined a spotlight on anomalies that didn't fit with the tidy, mathematical portrayal of humans in popular economic models (\"Anomalies\" was actually the title of the column.) One anomaly Thaler highlighted was what he called \"The Winner's Curse.\" The winner's curse refers to the winners of auctions. That includes the classic auction with auctioneers speaking really fast, selling antiques or paintings or whatever. But it also applies to markets where people competitively bid against each other to buy something, which includes things like bidding wars over buying a house, companies competing to acquire other companies, and sports teams fighting to sign star rookies in a draft. In the standard economic way of seeing auctions, the winner is someone who values it the most after a careful cost-benefit analysis of what they're bidding on, using the best available information. Presumably, the winner is, well, the winner. But what if the winner is, more often than not, actually the loser? What if winners, systematically, are the ones who pay too much for what they're buying? In one of his columns, Thaler suggested exactly that. That, actually, in competitive auctions, the winner is often the one who makes a mistake and overpays. That is, the winner is someone who — perhaps irrationally — buys something for more than its worth. Hence the curse. Some years back, Thaler compiled these old \"Anomalies\" columns in a book with a title inspired by this phenomenon. It's titled  The Winner's Curse . Now, Thaler, together with his University of Chicago Booth School of Business colleague Alex Imas, just published a new edition of the book. It has new material that seeks to expand upon and update Thaler's groundbreaking columns. And, at the end of each chapter, the book describes how the evidence on each phenomenon has evolved and strengthened in the years since the original columns. With a replication crisis plaguing social science, this was nice to see. The Origin Story Of The Winner's Curse In an upcoming episode of  The Indicator , Thaler tells the origin story of the winner's curse. \" This is a phenomenon that was not discovered by economists or psychologists,\" Thaler says. Instead, he says, it was discovered by oil companies. Basically, oil drillers got into bidding wars over the right to drill plots of land. \" And what they found was that the plots that they won had less oil than they expected.\" That is, the winners were the ones who tended to bid too much for drilling rights. \"And what they realized is there wasn't any problem with their geologists,\" Thaler says. \"The problem was with their bidding.\" It kinda makes sense why winners in auctions would actually often really be the losers (in the sense they pay more for something than it's really worth). Because when you think about it, the winner of an auction is the outlier. They're the ones who offered to pay the most. Everyone else's bid is lower, suggesting they believe — often quite correctly — a plot of land, or whatever they're bidding on, is not actually worth what the winner is willing to pay for it. Researchers have found a winner's curse in many other domains. Social scientists have found it in lab experiments. Scholars have seen it in the market for book publishing, where auctioned books tend not to earn back their advances. The economists James Cassing and Richard Douglas  found it  in the market for free agents in Major League Baseball. The financial economist Richard Roll  found it  when companies acquire other companies. He found that companies tend to overpay for the companies they acquire, and he wrote this could be the result of what he called the \"hubris hypothesis.\" That is, titans of business are often too sure of themselves and too gung ho to buy other companies, and they misread the true value of what they seek to acquire and therefore overpay for them. Thaler himself,  together with Cade Massey , found a winner's curse in the top picks of the NFL draft. \"Does the performance of the players selected with those early picks live up to the hopes and dreams of the teams that now have them? Not so much,\" Thaler and Imas write. \"The owners may be dreaming of getting a Tom Brady with that first pick, but somehow they manage to forget that Brady himself was taken with the 199th pick!\" So how can you avoid the winner's curse? Thaler has some simple advice.  Thaler told us: \"The way you have to think about bidding in an auction is: if I win the auction, will I be happy?\" Thaler says you should be especially wary when you're in auctions or bidding wars with lots of people.

That's the message from FDA Commissioner  Dr. Marty Makary. The agency announced it will remove \"black box\" warning labels from estrogen-based hormone therapy, which treat the symptoms of menopause, saying the warnings have made women scared to try the therapy and doctors reluctant to prescribe it.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The warnings stem from the early 2000s when data from the  Women's Health Initiative study  found hormone therapy increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer. But, women in that study were given a type of hormone therapy formulation that is no longer commonly used. And the average age of women in the study was 63, which is now considered too late to start hormone therapy. Now, experts say there's a lot more known about safe and effective combinations, when therapy is initiated earlier. \"If you're under age 60 or within ten years of menopause onset, when you start hormone therapy, you're going to see improvements in hot flashes, sweats, fewer sleep disruptions, \" says  Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton , a menopause expert at the University of Virginia Health.  She also points to protection against bone loss and fractures, as well as potential benefits for heart health, brain fog and overall quality of life. \"When it's dosed appropriately, hormone therapy can be given safely and have multiple benefits,\" she says. But here's an important reality check: \"Not all women can take hormone therapy,\" Pinkerton says. She says some women have medical conditions or symptoms that can make hormone therapy risky. \"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you,\" Pinkerton says. So, here are some things to consider when talking to your healthcare provider about hormone therapy for menopause. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. When should you start hormone therapy?  Experts recommend starting estrogen therapy before the age of 60 or within ten years of the start of menopause — which begins one year after your last period. Many women remain on birth control through perimenopause, which can help with hot flashes and night sweats as hormones fluctuate.  Once you're through the menopause transition and you don't need pregnancy prevention, then it doesn't make as much sense to use birth control, Pinkerton says, because it's typically stronger than the amount of estrogen used in menopause hormone therapy, so that's a good time to talk to your provider about hormone therapy options. 2. How long should you be on hormone therapy? In general, women stay on hormone therapy for three to five years, but that's not a hard and fast rule.  \"For women who have persistent symptoms or bone loss — which can be treated with hormone therapy — we will continue it,\" Pinkerton says. But, it's important to keep assessing each year. \"It's about working with the patient to come up with what's safest and best,\" Pinkerton says. \"We don't take someone off [hormone therapy] just because it's been three to five years, \" says Lauren Streicher of Northwestern University. She points to differences in how long menopause symptoms persist, noting that Black and Hispanic women tend to  experience symptoms for longer    time periods. 3. How has hormone therapy changed? Science has  evolved over the last 20 years , since the results of the Women's Health Initiative came out. And, importantly, there's been a shift in how estrogen is administered, as well as new formulations of hormones. For instance, many women are now prescribed patches instead of pills. \"We know that oral therapy can slightly increase the risk of blood clots and stroke,\" Pinkerton says, so providers often opt for transdermal therapy for women at risk of these conditions. Transdermal patches, gels or rings deliver estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin which research shows can  lower the risk  of blood clots. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Also, women enrolled in the WHI study were given synthetic progestin which was linked to an increased breast cancer risk. But, now doctors can prescribe   micronized progesterone  that has fewer side effects. Micronized progesterone is  a bioidentical hormone  with a molecular structure identical to the endogenous progesterone produced in the ovaries. 4. Do all estrogen products carry the same risks? No. Local estrogen, such as low-dose vaginal creams, target symptoms such as vaginal dryness, painful sex, bladder control and reduced risk of urinary tract infections. This is different from systemic estrogen, delivered through pills, patches or gels. Systemic estrogen is a higher-dose treatment that circulates throughout the body to address symptoms including hot flashes and night sweats, and can carry a higher risk of side effects. \"I think most would agree that with local, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy that the risks are negligible,\" says  Dr. Monica Christmas , director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago. \"For local, vaginal estrogen, it's reasonable to remove the black box warning. I don't think we need to scare people unnecessarily,\" Christmas says. However, for higher dose, systemic estrogen therapy — which is absorbed into the blood stream — including estrogen pills, Christmas and other menopause experts are more equivocal about removing the black box warning.  \"It provides a pause,\" Christmas says, and prompts patients to discuss the risks with their providers.\" 5. Who should avoid hormone therapy?  Some women have medical conditions that can make hormone therapy more risky. This includes women with estrogen sensitive breast or uterine cancer, and women who are at high risk for or have had a heart attack, stroke, blood clot, or pulmonary embolism. \"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you,\" Pinkerton says 6. Are there alternatives for women who don't  want to take hormone therapy? The Food and Drug Administration has approved two non-hormonal medications to treat severe hot flashes in menopause. According to the FDA, about 80% of menopausal women experience hot flashes which can include  sweating, flushing and chills  that last for several minutes. Lynkuet , which was approved last month, and  Veozah , which was approved in 2023, are both oral medications that work by  targeting the neural activity  that causes hot flashes during menopause. Lynkuet has been shown to reduce the severity and frequencies of hot flashes.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The National Institutes of Health has  tips for managing symptoms,  including limiting alcohol and caffeine, and maintaining a healthy body weight. And early-stage research shows hypnotherapy and mindfulness meditation may help manage hot flashes. Some people find herbal remedies helpful.   A study of medicinal plants  including sage, lemon balm, red clover and licorice finds they may be effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Nov. 11th, 2025 \n         An earlier version of this story mistakenly described micronized progesterone as a bioidentical hormone with a molecular structure identical to the estrogen produced in the ovaries. In fact, its molecular structure is identical to that of endogenous progesterone produced there. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97245","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:54:00.000-05:00","title":"House prepares to vote on legislation to end the shutdown after Senate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 41 days of a record-breaking government shutdown, the U.S. Senate voted 60–40 to approve a continuing resolution that funds most of the federal government through January 30, 2026, with full funding for SNAP through September 30, 2026.

The measure  would fund much of the government through Jan. 30 and provide funding for some agencies through the end of next September. But the shutdown will not end right away. The U.S. House of Representatives must also pass   the legislation, which is not guaranteed, before President Trump can sign it into law. House leadership has told members to return to Washington for a vote as early as Wednesday afternoon. Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted with nearly every Senate Republican to approve the stopgap funding bill after a more than monthlong impasse that resulted in missed paychecks for millions of federal workers, delayed food assistance benefits and air travel disruptions. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the sole GOP no vote.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The funding package includes language to reverse reductions in force of federal employees by the Trump administration during the shutdown, protections against further layoffs through the end of January, backpay for federal employees and a trio of appropriations bills, including one that will fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026. \"This is a great victory for the American people, and it shows that the Senate can work,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me. A deal without Democrats' health care demands But the deal does not include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums that are set to expire later this year. Most Democrats have refused to vote for a funding measure that did not include a concrete path to preserve the subsidies. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Sunday that he would hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the expiring subsidies. Thune has said throughout the shutdown that Republicans would only negotiate on the subsidies once the government was open. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the majority of Senate Democrats disagreed that this was the best deal they could get, doubting that Republicans would agree to extend the subsidies without the pressure of an ongoing shutdown. After Democratic victories on election night last week, some senators said it was a mistake to back down. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., said on the floor before the vote. \"The people I work for need more than that. They need health care that they can afford, not a symbolic vote.\" Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement to end the shutdown after holding a series of on-again, off-again talks over the last several weeks. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who helped drive the bipartisan negotiations, told reporters Monday that more than eight members of the caucus had initially pledged to support the deal, but some backed out ahead of the vote.  On to the House House leadership alerted members Monday morning that they would have 36 hours' notice to return to Capitol Hill for a vote. The House has not conducted official business since the chamber passed its version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. While Speaker Mike Johnson has held near-daily press conferences at the Capitol, many rank-and-file have not been in for weeks. \"At the very moment that they do that final vote, I will call all House members to return as quickly as possible,\" Johnson told reporters Monday and, noting the ongoing shutdown-related air travel delays, told members, \"You need to begin right now returning to the Hill.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Moving the measure through the House could require some arm-twisting. Many Democrats have indicated they will not support the deal, and some hard-line Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either. But Johnson projected confidence Monday that the measure can pass and said Trump is ready to sign it. Coming health care debate Democrats now need to come up with health care legislation that can get the support of enough Republicans. Some Republicans in the House and Senate  have expressed interest  in preventing the Affordable Care Act premiums from skyrocketing, but many have also talked about the need for reforms like income caps and fraud prevention. A few weeks is not much time for an overhaul, and people are deciding now whether to keep their  insurance plans  next year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If we want to get a bill that has bipartisan support, we've got to address some of those issues,\" Shaheen told reporters on Monday. \"I think the White House is going to engage on this because the president has figured out, and his pollsters have been very clear, it's more of an issue for people in red states than it is in blue states. If he [doesn't], well, shame on him.\"   Speaker Johnson, though, told reporters on Monday that he would not guarantee an ACA vote in the House should a bill pass the Senate. The government funding situation is not fully resolved for the year, either. The full-year funding measures passed by the Senate include money for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs and the legislative branch. Congress still needs to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution runs out again at the end of January.  NPR's Barbara Sprunt and Deirdre Walsh contributed reporting. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603421","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00-04:00","title":"Prominent Afrikaners Refuse to Be 'Pawns,' and Hit Back at Trump's Claims About South Africa","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced the U.S. will not send any officials to the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, citing alleged 'human rights abuses' against Afrikaners, including claims of land confiscation and violence.

back at Trump's claims about South Africa \n         By Kate Bartlett \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:13 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Trump has announced that no U.S. officials will attend the G20 summit hosted by South Africa — the current rotating chair of the group of major world economies — in Johannesburg later this month, citing \"human rights\" concerns. Vice President Vance had been due to attend in Trump's place. \"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa. Afrikaners (People who are descended from Dutch settlers, and also French and German immigrants) are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" Trump  posted on Truth Social  over the weekend. He previously said South Africa should be kicked out of \"the gs\" altogether. Trump has been relentlessly critical of South Africa since his return to office. He  ambushed  the country's president Cyril Ramaphosa during a White House visit in May falsely accusing his government of seizing white-owned land;  cut aid  to South Africa;  his administration  expelled  the South African ambassador to Washington; slapped the country with  30% tariffs;  repeated debunked far-right claims about a white genocide -  and as a result prioritized Afrikaners for  fast-track refugee status  in the U.S. (while stopping refugee admissions from most other countries). The South African government has repeatedly tried to correct the White House, providing statistics that disprove these claims — for example the fact that Black people are by far the worst affected by violent crime and that whites still own the majority of commercial farmland — to no avail. Now, some white Afrikaners themselves, as well as Afrikaans groups, are calling out what they say are the U.S. administration's \"lies\" and \"falsehoods\" in their name. \"We reject the narrative that casts Afrikaners as victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa,\" a group of over 40 prominent Afrikaners said in an  open letter last month . \"We are not pawns in America's culture wars.\" The group included writers, journalists, musicians, university lecturers and Christian clergy. \"Afrikaners have done harm in the past, and we acknowledge that,\" the letter said, referring to the fact that their ancestors – as well as British settlers – colonized the country. The Afrikaners later set up the apartheid system which segregated the races, prevented the Black majority from voting, and brutally clamped down on dissent. \"As citizens of post-apartheid South Africa, we have dedicated ourselves to building our country. Singling us out as victims of multiracialism alienates us from our fellow-South Africans and harms relationships that have been fostered over the past 30 years.\" \"Please stop lying\" Max du Preez, an Afrikaner journalist and author who was among the signatories of the letter, told NPR they rejected the narrative coming out of the White House as \"the abuse of our ethnic identity to further the MAGA movement's interests.\" \"There is no genocide in South Africa, there's absolutely no persecution of anyone based on race. Our constitution has iron-clad protection of every citizen's human rights,\" he said. \"Not a single square inch of white-owned land has been confiscated since we became a democracy in 1994,\" du Preez added. \"Please stop lying about us and using us as pawns.\" Trump has repeatedly said he particularly wants to help white Afrikaans farmers. But some agricultural organizations that represent them have stressed their businesses will be hurt too if the U.S. sanctions South Africa. Christo van der Rheede represented white farmers for years as head of the biggest agricultural organization in South Africa. He now leads the FW De Klerk Foundation, named for the former Afrikaans president who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for their roles in ending apartheid. \"It is now very important for all South Africans to unite and refute the statements by President Donald Trump … that Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated. This is simply not true,\" van der Rheede said after Trump's G20 announcement. He said the U.S. should reconsider boycotting the G20. \"The role of the G20 as a key driver of uniting and building a better and just world is critical and it will be very negative for the US and its business interests in South Africa should it continue to premise its reasons for staying away on falsehoods,\" he added. Despite the pushback from some segments of Afrikaans society, there are others who are fierce supporters of Trump and have welcomed his position on South Africa. For years some Afrikaner groups have been traveling to the U.S. pushing the \"white genocide\" narrative and lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. For its part, the South African government released a measured statement noting Trump's announcement. \"We really think this is going to be one of the most significant G20's to date albeit without the U.S.A. I think that is something that will affect the U.S. as a country, not the entire G20,\"   Chrispin Phiri, spokesman for the Department of International Relations, later told NPR. The summit  will be attended by European heads of state and China's President Xi Jinping is expected. Its theme — which the U.S. State Department has objected to — is \"solidarity, equality and sustainability.\" \"South Africa is doing very bad things,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio  posted on X  in February. \"Using G20 to promote 'solidarity, equality, & sustainability.' In other words: DEI and climate change.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   President Trump has announced that no U.S. official will be attending the G20 summit in South Africa this month, citing what he called, quote, \"human rights abuses\" against white minority Afrikaners. Vice President JD Vance had been due to attend in Trump's place. But as Kate Bartlett reports from Johannesburg, some prominent Afrikaners are urging the U.S. to reconsider, saying the U.S. should not boycott the first G20 ever to be held on African soil. KATE BARTLETT, BYLINE: Trump has been relentlessly critical of South Africa since his return to office. He ambushed the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, during a White House visit in May, falsely claiming the South African government was seizing white-owned land. He cut aid to South Africa, repeated debunked far-right claims about a white genocide there and as a result, prioritized Afrikaners for refugee status in the U.S. Now he says one of Africa's richest democracies shouldn't be hosting the G20, posting on Truth Social over the weekend that Afrikaners are, quote, \"being killed and slaughtered and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated.\" White Afrikaner journalist and author Max du Preez says that Trump's assertions are false. MAX DU PREEZ: There's absolutely no persecution of anyone based on race. Our constitution has ironclad protection of every citizen's human rights. BARTLETT: Du Preez is one of dozens of Afrikaner intellectuals who recently signed an open letter refuting the U.S. administration's claims. He told NPR they rejected what he called the abuse of their ethnic identity to, quote, \"further the MAGA movement's interests.\" DU PREEZ: Not a single square inch of white-owned land has been confiscated since we became a democracy in 1994. Please stop lying about us and using us as pawns. BARTLETT: Black people are by far the biggest victims of violent crime in South Africa, and white people still own the majority of commercial farmland. Ironically, those white commercial farmers would be among the worst affected by Trump's 30% tariffs on South African goods. Christo van der Rheede, head of the FW de Klerk Foundation, agrees Trump's allegations are baseless. CHRISTO VAN DER RHEEDE: These claims are simply untrue, dangerous and not supported by any credible data. BARTLETT: Van der Rheede said it would also be very negative for the U.S. and its business interests if it stayed away from the G20 summit taking place at the end of next week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: We are ready. Are you? BARTLETT: South Africa has been promoting its big event all year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: We welcome you to South Africa. BARTLETT: The South African government has released a measured statement in response to Trump's announcement, once again denying his accusations. Chrispin Phiri, spokesman for the Department of International Relations, remained positive. CHRISPIN PHIRI: We really think that this is going to be one of the most significant G20s to date, albeit without the attendance of the USA. BARTLETT: European countries and China have backed South Africa's hosting of the summit. Its theme - solidarity, equality and sustainability - has drawn criticism from the U.S. State Department. But despite what the South Africans say, the absence of the G20's largest economy - the U.S. - will be impossible to ignore.

After all, Armistice Day, or Remembrance Day — also known as Veterans Day in the U.S. – is Tuesday. The day annually  marks the end  of one of history's most catastrophic conflicts, World War I. For the most part, the endings that animate many of this week's new novels don't seek such world-historical consequence. Ann Packer, Quiara Alegria Hudes and the other authors who grace the list below are concerned with much more intimate details, the kind you're more likely to encounter just down the street than on a battlefield or at an international summit. That said, the twisty history of currency — the subject of this week's one nonfiction entry in the roundup — reinforces a lesson learned with the peace of 1918: Beware of endings; they have the odd habit of being yet another beginning in disguise. Some Bright Nowhere , by Ann Packer Ann Packer's first novel in a decade finds the American author again pursuing a deceptively simple premise: A long-married couple must prepare for and confront their final weeks together before death comes for one of them. But don't be fooled by the saccharine-sounding summary. As  Fresh Air 's Maureen Corrigan explained in  a review of Packer's previous novel ,  The Children's Crusade , the author has a knack for turning what might have been \"mundane mass-market fiction\" into a rich, splintered narrative that \"illuminate[s] the unexpected depths of the commonplace.\" The White Hot , by Quiara Alegria Hudes It's possible you've already encountered Hudes' writing without knowing it. Though her name is new to the adult fiction shelf, the veteran playwright penned the book for the Tony-winning musical  In the Heights ,  wrote the screenplay  for  its 2021 film adaptation  and won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for  her play  Water by the Spoonful , about the return of an Iraq war veteran. In  The White Hot ,  she explores a departure , in the voice of a young mother who tries to understand and explain her decision to leave her family for the freedom of a one-way ticket far, far away. The Silver Book , by Olivia Laing Laing's writing roams a Venn diagram of memoir, art criticism, history and fiction, rarely pursuing just one genre without including at least some elements of the others. Her memoir  The Lonely City , for instance, wove the stuff of academic journals into a  chronicle of her life in New York City . Her only previous novel,  Crudo , dressed up in the persona of author Kathy Acker for an exercise that NPR's reviewer admiringly called a \"memoir in drag.\" For its part,  The Silver Book , though a novel, sets its inventions in an especially consequential – and controversial – era of Italian cinema: the final year or two before the brutal, unsolved murder of director Pier Paolo Pasolini. Evensong , by Stewart O'Nan O'Nan's latest novel finds the \"oracle of the ordinary and maven of the middle class\" — as NPR reviewer Heller McAlpin  described the novelist in 2012  — once again mining the mundane for its hidden magic. In  Evensong , the cult favorite centers a small, lovingly rendered group of older women as they navigate the peculiar challenges of growing older, together as friends. The History of Money: A Story of Humanity , by David McWilliams McWilliams is an Irish economist,  podcaster  and founder of a festival that  pairs world economics with standup comedy . Promoting the festival back in 2010, McWilliams  explained to NPR  why he orients his work more toward the hoi polloi than the ivory tower: \"If you think that knowledge is power, well, then giving people the knowledge, packaging the knowledge in such a way that the knowledge becomes accessible — that empowers the people.\" That rings true in this lively, lightfooted life story of currency, which cares less for comprehensiveness than keeping the door open for experts and novices alike. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196978629","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00+00:00","title":"Tech-Driven Legal Evolution: AI and Blockchain in the Modern Justice System","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines how modern legal systems are adapting to rapid technological changes, particularly through the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain.

Counterintuitive though it may seem, that's the advice of world-renowned relationship researchers and clinical psychologists Julie Schwartz Gottman and John Gottman.  \"Conflict really has a purpose,\" says John Gottman, \"and the purpose is mutual understanding.\"   In the 40 years they've dedicated to the study and practice of fostering healthy, long-lasting relationships, the Gottmans have found that the happiest and most successful couples don't avoid conflict, fear or anger – they just know how to fight fairly and productively. The Gottmans' new book, published in January,  Fight Right: How Successful Couples Turn Conflict into Connection , is a guide to doing just that. It aims to teach couples \"how to have conflicts that don't push them apart but instead produce connection and compassion for one another,\" says Julie Schwartz Gottman.   Pulling from decades of relationship research and thousands of hours of interviews and therapy sessions with couples, the Gottmans identify some of the most common fights — and offer research-backed solutions for coming out the other side stronger.  1. 'The Flood'  What it is:  According to the Gottmans, feeling \"flooded\" is the state of being psychologically and physically overwhelmed during a conflict.  \"When you feel deeply attacked and there's no way out, people will move into flight or fight\" mode, in which stress hormones course through the body, says Julie Schwartz Gottman. As a result, \"they cannot think straight. They cannot hear well. It's a terrible state to be in.\" What this conflict looks like in real life:  Your friend says something insensitive to your girlfriend over dinner. \"You never back me up!\" she complains on the way home. \"You're supposed to be on my side!\"  You try to defend yourself, but she won't let you off the hook. Your heart rate rises. Your palms go sweaty. You turn away and go silent, refusing to respond to anything she has to say.  How to handle this type of conflict:  Put your fight on pause, say the Gottmans.   This idea may seem strange for couples who follow the adage \"never go to sleep angry.\" But the Gottmans say if one or both partners are \"flooded,\" taking a break is the best way to keep a bad argument from getting worse.  So the next time you feel your jaw clench or your stomach drop during a spat, stop the discussion and ask your partner to take a break. A pause can be as short as 20 minutes or as long as 24 hours – aim for enough time that you'll both have cooled down, says Julie Schwartz Gottman. Once you agree on a timeframe, get out of each other's space and – here's the hardest part –  don't think about the fight,  John Gottman says.  Instead of feeling like a victim, dwelling on what your partner said or planning out your argument, Julie Schwartz Gottman says it's important to spend this time away from your partner doing something self-soothing. Read a book, listen to a podcast, go for a run – do anything that will give your body \"a chance to metabolize all the stress hormones\" and allow you to come back to the conflict with a calm body and a clear mind, she says. 2. 'The Standoff' What it is:  A \"standoff\" is a disagreement in which both sides feel they have to \"win\" the argument, says John Gottman. It's a common problem. In a 2020 study of over 40,000 couples beginning couples therapy, the Gottmans found that  84 percent of the heterosexual couples  they interviewed said they were struggling with an inability to compromise.  What it looks like in real life:  You and your partner have reached an impasse about where to send your son to school. You feel strongly about the local public school down the street. But your partner wants him to attend private school like he did. How to handle this type of conflict:  To get out of gridlock and find some common ground, the Gottmans suggest doing an exercise they created for couples in therapy who can't find a compromise. They call it the \"Bagel Method\" – named because of its shape. It's designed to help people in relationships understand the core of their desires in a disagreement and find the validity and beauty in their partner's point of view.  To do the \"Bagel Method\" exercise, each partner draws two concentric ovals on a piece of paper. In the inside oval, write down what you absolutely cannot compromise on regarding the issue. Write down what you  can  compromise on in the outside oval.  So, the inside oval for you might say: \"my son will have a quality education,\" \"he will stay connected to the local community\" and \"we're supporting public education.\" Your outside oval might say: \"maybe we can move him to private school during high school,\" \"he can get involved in the local community in other ways\" and \"we can ask him when he's old enough to weigh in on the decision.\"  Then, compare and contrast your \"bagel\" with your partner. Ask each other why the things in the inner circle are so important to you. Discuss where your flexible areas overlap and workshop some possible compromises. Here, that might look like sending your son to private school but enrolling him in local after-school soccer, then assessing how things are going after a year.  The Gottmans say after doing this exercise, couples are often surprised by how much flexibility they have and how much compassion this creates between them.  \"It's so important to understand that your partner is not your clone. They are a different human being with a different internal world,\" says Julie Schwartz Gottman. So, conflict is an understandable and healthy part of being in a relationship, say the Gottmans. When it happens, just remember it's possible to \"communicate with love and affection, even when you disagree.\"  3. 'The Bomb Drop' (The Harsh Startup)  What it is:  This fight is characterized by a harsh startup, attacking your partner with anger and criticism, often out of the blue and without context for the other person, says John Gottman – hence the name.  What this conflict looks like in real life:  Let's say you and your partner are trying to save up, but you get the credit card bill and find they've overspent again. As soon as your husband walks through the door you yell, \"I can't believe how irresponsible you are!\" How to handle this type of conflict:  Starting a conflict with negativity like this often portends poor outcomes, say the Gottmans. In fact, their research shows that  the first three minutes of a fight  determines not only the way a conversation will go but also the future of a relationship. The 1999 study looked at the behavior of 124 newlywed couples and found that when couples began a fight with negative emotions like criticism, contempt, defensiveness or stonewalling, they were very likely to break up down the road.   So if you and your partner want to go the distance, the Gottmans suggest starting your disagreements with a gentler approach. \"What that means is you point your finger not at your partner, but at yourself,\" says John Gottman. In order to do that, try using the Gottman formula, developed in response to that 1999 study, for soft start-ups: Say: \"I feel (emotion) about (situation/problem) and I need (a positive and specific action your partner can take to help improve the situation).\"   So, \"You're so irresponsible with money!\" transforms into: \"I feel really stressed (the emotion) about our budget this month – it looks like we're going to be short again (the situation). Can we sit down together and plan how to cut some of our expenses (the positive need)?\"  Hurling blanket accusations or criticisms gives your partner no choice but to go on the defensive. But this approach creates space for your partner to understand the issue and show up for you, says Julie Schwartz Gottman.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. So happy almost Valentine's Day. You know those little Valentine's Day cards that have the cute, corny messages on them, like the classic be mine, or maybe there's a bunny holding a heart and it says somebunny loves you? You know what those never say? Let's fight. Everybody talks about the romance of relationships, the red roses and endless sex. But nobody really wants to think about the disagreements that are a completely normal part of a partnership. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: A lot of people really don't know how to manage conflict. JOHN GOTTMAN: What we're seeing a lot is couples in the United States are engaged in kind of a standoff. So they start by presenting the issue as a defect in their partner's personality, which just leads the partner to become defensive. And it escalates very quickly into a standoff, an attack, defend, standoff. And when that happens, it really is very dangerous for the future of the relationship. SEGARRA: Any of that sound familiar? If so, it's time to change how you view your disagreements. JOHN GOTTMAN: Conflict really has a purpose, and the purpose is mutual understanding. SEGARRA: That was Julie and John Gottman, world-renowned researchers and clinical psychologists who've been married for more than 30 years and have spent the last 40 dedicated to the study and practice of fostering healthy, long-lasting relationships. They've watched thousands of couples argue, and they are able to predict with over 90% accuracy if a couple will stay together after witnessing just three minutes of a conflict. Yeah, how you fight matters a lot more than you might think. The Gottman's new book, \"Fight Right,\" details the keys to successful conflict found in couples that master love. JOHN GOTTMAN: A couple that stays together and, you know, pretty much likes one another over time, and they're pretty satisfied with the relationship, that's a master. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Versus a disaster, which is a couple that typically has really terrible conflicts and grows more and more distant and more and more unhappy. So we don't want to be disasters. But the great thing is that disasters can become masters simply by reconfiguring how they talk about their conflicts and become more connected. JOHN GOTTMAN: Good point, Julie. SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to learn how to fight right. Reporter Andee Tagle talks to the Gottmans about some of the most common fights in relationships, why they happen and how we can turn conflict into connection. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE: If you want to fight right, you first need to understand what Julie and John call the conflict culture of your relationship. Being aware of your fighting style and that of your partner's will make it easier to connect amid conflict. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: So first of all, what people can do is ask how was conflict handled in your family when you were growing up? A lot of times, we will either imitate what our parents or our caretakers did when we were growing up or we will go the opposite direction. And that background determines what our culture of conflict is. We might be conflict avoiders, which means we may just agree to disagree, but we don't resolve problems by really hashing out our own position on the issue and trying to reach a compromise. Or we may validate each other in talking about conflict, which means we'll express our feelings somewhat but very rationally, and we will move to problem-solving very quickly. We may not explore as deeply as we need to what's going on in our own position on the issue. And third, we may be volatile, which means lots of emotion, lots of intensity, lots of passion when we express our emotions. None of those is bad. It's simply a matter of recognizing which you are - avoidant, validating or volatile - and talking with your partner about what kind of discussion and conflict helps you feel more comfortable and more listened to. TAGLE: OK. Let me just make sure I understand. In order to understand our styles, to start, we need to interrogate our past and interrogate our influences. What else? What's next? JOHN GOTTMAN: One of the things that's very important, Andee, is the ratio of positivity to negativity in a conflict discussion. And what we found was, whatever style of conflict you have, the masters of relationships, the ones that stay together happily, have this ratio of five times as much positive emotion as negative emotion in a conflict discussion, which means that they're really creating this sort of lubricated climate of understanding by just expressing interest, and nodding their heads, and, you know, vocalizing and saying, oh, interesting, tell me more about that, you know? Oh, wow, you know? And that kind of feedback, that eye contact and vocalization lubricates the wheels of communication, whereas when there's a standoff, people don't express any affection. There's very little humor. And they're kind of, you know, like stone walls just sort of standing there and really being opposite of one another and disagreeing with their partner constantly as opposed to trying to reach mutual understanding. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Let's call this takeaway two. Whenever possible, but especially in conflict, aim for the positive - a little humor, offering some validation or a simple, OK, I see your point, can go a long way in maintaining a successful relationship. Now let's turn to some of the most common fights people have. The first one I want to cover with you, I am extremely guilty of. But if you tell my husband, I will deny... (LAUGHTER) TAGLE: ...That I said that. You call it the bomb drop. Please, can you tell us what we're talking about? Give us an example of the bomb drop fight. JOHN GOTTMAN: Sure. A lot of times, it comes from not feeling entitled to really ask for what you need and suppressing your irritation and your upset and not talking about it. And then when it finally does come out, it's almost like you've dropped a bomb on the relationship. And what typically happens is you express your discomfort by describing your partner, not describing yourself. So we call it harsh startup, and you really describe your partner in very negative terms and say, you know, the problem in this relationship is that you're so selfish; you're inconsiderate; you only think about yourself. And they go on and on, really pointing a finger at their partner, and that's guaranteed to lead to defensiveness. So that's what a bomb drop is. TAGLE: The defining quality of this type of fight is that it kind of comes out of nowhere, you know? Like, you're walking along, and everything's fine. It seems like you're having a good day, and it's suddenly like, I can't believe you, right? JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. TAGLE: You have been awful for the past 10 years. (LAUGTHER) TAGLE: Right? Is that - do I have that right? JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. Exactly, you got it. TAGLE: OK. So we don't want to do the harsh startup or drop that bomb. John, can you explain the alternative, what you call the soft startup? JOHN GOTTMAN: What that means is, you point your finger not at your partner but at yourself and say what you feel about a situation - not about a person, but about a situation - that is irritating or upsetting you. And then you talk about what you do need. And in effect, the masters are giving their partner a recipe for succeeding with them, a way to shine for them. So I feel, about what, and here's what I need. And a positive need is the opposite of what you don't need, what you don't want, what you're upset about. So you really have to do a little bit of work to think about, what do you want? And so this softened startup has those three parts to it - I feel, about what, and here's what my positive need is. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Let me give you an example of the difference between a harsh startup and a softened startup. So let's say that your partner's mother is coming over for dinner tonight. TAGLE: OK. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: And she always finds something to criticize you about, no matter what. It's your cooking, it's your cleaning, you know, whatever - or your child raising, she always criticizes you. So you want to bring this up to your partner. A harsh startup would sound like this. Dear, your mother is a wart on the back of humanity. TAGLE: (Laughter). JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: All right. OK. How's your partner going to respond to that? Probably not well, unless your partner totally agrees with you, that's always a possibility. However, softened startup would sound like this. Honey, I'm really feeling nervous - there's the emotion - about your mother coming over to dinner tonight. She often find something to criticize me for. That's the situation. Would you please stand up for me if she does that again? There's the positive need. That's how your partner can shine for you. JOHN GOTTMAN: And Andee, let me contrast that with when you do this following thing, then I feel this way, and I don't like that, that's in an attack mode because it immediately puts the other person in a defensive place, you know? So here, you're not saying you're the fault of my emotion, you're saying this situation is really frustrating for me or upsetting to me, and here's what I need from you. And that's a whole different way of being gentler in starting up talking about a conflict issue. TAGLE: So takeaway three - when it's time to fight, start soft. That formula again is I feel plus situation plus positive need. By using that I statement, keeping the discussion about only the matter at hand rather than your whole relationship or your partner's character, and asking them for exactly what you need to feel connected, you're providing your partner space to react calmly and a roadmap for a successful conversation. OK. Moving on to another type of fight - the flood. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: So this part of John's earliest research that was so significant. He would have a couple talking to one another, sitting in chairs, looking as calm as can be. But he and his colleague, Dr. Robert Levenson, also measured heart rate. They measured how much people jiggled in their chair. They looked at their facial expressions. And what they saw, particularly in heart rate, is that people could be speaking fairly calmly or maybe shutting down, but their heart rates were over 100 beats a minute. What that signifies is that your whole physiological system is very, very upset, and you've moved into fight or flight. Now, what are the situations that make you feel that way, either facing a saber-tooth tiger or facing your partner who's criticizing you... TAGLE: (Laughter). JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: ...And attacking you. And when you feel deeply attacked and there's no way out, people will move into flight or fight and they cannot think straight, they cannot hear well, it's a terrible state to be in. We call that flooding. The antidote to that is that as soon as somebody notices the signs that they're starting to flood - and everybody may have different signs of that in their own bodies, like getting hot or maybe their jaw getting clenched or their inability to breathe deeply - you have to say to your partner, can we please take a break right now? And then it's very important for that person to say when they will come back to continue the conversation. The other person needs to say, sure, let's take a break, and they will feel better knowing from the other person that they will be able to continue the conversation in a certain amount of time. While you're on the break, here's another thing that's a little bit different than what you would think... TAGLE: Sure. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: ...You do not think about the fight. So what you have to do is something self-soothing during your break that calms you down. It could be just reading a book, reading a magazine, or meditating, going for a run, listening to music, anything that takes your mind off the fight so your body has a chance to metabolize all the stress hormones that have been released in your body from being in fight or flight, and your body can calm down. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway four - it's OK to put your fight on pause - really, seriously. This one might feel hard for those of us who were raised on the phrase, never go to bed angry. But the research shows, when you're feeling overwhelmed, it's probably best to take a break. John and Julie recommend anywhere from 20 minutes up to a 24-hour pause to reset, calm down and then come back to the conflict table with a clear head. Next up - tackling the fight called the standoff. It's the kind of fight where both sides feel they have to win. But John and Julie say conflicts in relationships shouldn't have winners and losers. Here's what to do instead. You talk about an intervention in the book called the bagel method to, quote, \"help couples in conflict find a true compromise that feels good to both partners.\" Can you tell me a little bit more about the bagel method? JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Yes. So John and I really, really love bagels. Therefore, it's the bagel method. But for some of you not being familiar with bagels, you can call it the doughnut method. So here is what it looks like. If you take out a piece of paper, and you draw two concentric circles - a small one in the middle and a great big one outside that - it looks like a doughnut. In the center circle, before talking to one another, what are the things in your position on the issue that you cannot compromise on, that are so important to you, so core to your identity, to who you are, that if you gave up one of those or some of those, it would feel like you were giving up the bones of your body? But now listen. In the outer circle, this is where you put the things you're more flexible about, and those tend to be the nitty-gritty details of what you might arrive at for a compromise, like when something happens, where it happens, whose goes first, how much money do you spend, how much do you save, et cetera. How long does something last? TAGLE: Maybe your partner wants to move to sunny California, but you want to be closer to your family in Boston. Or your boyfriend wants to keep renting, but you're ready to buy a condo. Try takeaway five. If you've come to an impasse, use the bagel method. Write out what's truly non-negotiable on the inside and where you might have room in the outer circle. You might be surprised by what you find. JOHN GOTTMAN: Compromises often fail because people give up too much just for the sake of peace in the relationship, and so they don't put in those inflexible areas what's really important to them about their position on this issue. And when you give something really central up just for the sake of peace, it builds resentment, as opposed to in the bagel method, you can actually say, here's why this is so important to me; here's why I'm kind of inflexible about this; here's why that has to be part of our compromise; I have to feel like my dream is being honored in some way. And then the compromise doesn't get sabotaged in the future. TAGLE: Great distinction. So compromise is important, but it's also really important that you be true to yourself within it, that you not give up too much. JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. Exactly. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: And honor your partner's dreams as well, if you possibly can. JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. TAGLE: Our last takeaway, takeaway six - repair. Repair. Repair. This idea comes up again and again in the Gottmans' research. The couples who make it make an effort to stay connected and reduce harm to one another before, during and after a fight. That can look like a comment, a gesture, a joke. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: A repair is something that takes you right on back to the high road through saying something helpful right in that moment. JOHN GOTTMAN: Well, the thing about repair is that it needs to really be perceived as a repair by your partner. So one thing you can do that's very different is to say, I'm feeling defensive. Can you say that in a gentle way? You know, now, you're not getting defensive. You're just saying, I'm feeling defensive, or, I need to calm down, or, your point of view is very interesting; say more about it. These are all repairs that you can use. And we actually spent seven years - two graduate students of mine mostly did this, Amber Tabares and Janice Driver - studying what repairs worked and what repairs failed. Any repair you would use in a business meeting will fail in a love relationship, so things like, oh, let's consider our alternatives and evaluate them - anything that's really intellectual. But anything that's emotional, really, and self-disclosing really works much better, saying, you know, I feel like we're getting stuck; you know, tell me more about your point of view so I understand it better. TAGLE: So repair - very, very important, very critical - also, usually the most difficult part, at least if you're me, it can feel impossible to reach across the table and hold your spouse's hand after a big fight. You know, even when or maybe especially if you know it could make a big difference in that moment, right? What advice can you share with us about making and accepting repair attempts? JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: OK. So the one that you described, which is taking your partner's hand, is really extreme, and I'm right there with you, Andee. I could never do that, either. But if you've said the wrong thing, and you're aware that you've said the wrong thing, you can say as a repair, or your partner can, you know what? I just blurted that out. Let me try again. That's a repair. How about bringing in some positivity, a little bit of positivity? What John was talking about when he talked about the ratio that's so important, of five positives to one negative to make it a healthy conflict conversation, well, positives can include things like, interesting, I never thought of it that way; fair enough; good point; oh, OK; tell me more. Those are all positives. JOHN GOTTMAN: And we quote William Shakespeare here in \"Merchant Of Venice,\" where Portia says, \"the quality of mercy is not strained. It drops as the gentle rain from heaven, and it blesses both he who shows mercy and he who gives mercy.\" And the same thing with repair. Both people are blessed by a repair that's effective - the person making the repair attempt and the person receiving the repair attempt - so that if both people, you know, know about repair, then they can use it together. TAGLE: Julie, John, thank you so much for joining us today. I have learned so much. You've given me so much to work with. I really appreciate it. JOHN GOTTMAN: Thank you, Andee. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Andee, this has been a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK. Let's recap. The conflict in your relationship is an opportunity for connection. Here are things to remember to fight right. Takeaway one - understand your fighting style. Are you avoidant, volatile, validating? And how does that contrast with your partner's culture of conflict? Takeaway two - aim for five positive interactions for every negative interaction. That's the sweet spot for a solid relationship. Takeaway three - start soft. That three-part formula is, I feel, plus the situation and finally ask for a positive need. Takeaway four - if you're feeling flooded, put your fight on pause. Decide with your partner how long you need to cool down. Then walk away, and do anything else but think about your fight until it's time to return to the table. Takeaway five - if you need to find a compromise, try the bagel method - non-negotiables in the center, items of flexibility in the outer ring. Takeaway six - repair, repair, repair. I know - trust me; I know - just how hard it can feel to reach out to your partner in the middle of conflict, but remember; you're on the same team with the same goal of understanding each other. Offer each other grace wherever you can.

I can never seem to get a handle on my clutter. How can I clean up my space — and keep it that way?  That's a question that  Star Hansen  thinks a lot about. She's a professional organizer who teaches classes on home organizing and has been featured in over 30 TV shows and online series on the subject.  She believes that keeping your home neat and tidy is a continual process. \"Organizing is not a one-and-done task to complete,\" she says. You have to take the time to \"create systems that work for you.\" Hansen shares more about her decluttering philosophy — along with useful strategies to keep our messes at bay.  1. Understand your clutter  Hansen says everyone's clutter tells a personal story. \"What becomes clutter and where your clutter accumulates can say a lot about what's going on with you.\"   If you have unwanted piles of stuff accumulating around your house, ask yourself:   \"What's making this hard to get rid of?\" she says. \"A lot of times, the trip-up is from holding on to the past or wanting a different reality than the one we're living in.\" That blazer that hasn't fit for years? Maybe it reveals a yearning for your former profession. Those 20 pairs of chopsticks in your kitchen drawer? Maybe they're speaking to your guilt around waste and sustainability.  When you understand the reasons behind your clutter, says Hansen, it's a lot easier to know what to keep and what to get rid of.  2. Start small  When it comes to organizing, don't bite off more than you can chew, says Hansen. If you start off with too big a goal, you might get discouraged if the job takes too long. So don't try to revamp your entire garage in one afternoon. Instead, start with something less challenging, like your purse or one single bathroom drawer. Save more complicated items, like tax paperwork, or sentimental items, like family photos and memorabilia, for last. These kinds of organizational projects often take the most time and emotional energy, says Hansen, so you'll want to build up your decluttering muscle first. You can also work within short time constraints. Say you only have an hour to declutter your home this week. Hansen says to divide that time into 20-minute intervals. For the first 20 minutes, look for trash to throw away. The next 20 minutes, identify anything you want to give away or donate. Spend the last 20 minutes putting items back where they belong.  Setting realistic goals and breaking tasks up in to manageable portions can help keep you invested in the process, says Hansen. \"What we're looking for is small wins.\" 3. Take the emotion out of it Once you've chosen an area to declutter, take inventory of everything you have in that space, says Hansen. If you're tackling your kitchen, for example, take every item out of the drawers and cabinets and sort them into organized piles on your kitchen countertop and dining room table.  Then comes the hard part: figuring out what to get rid of. At this stage, Hansen suggests looking at your items with neutral eyes. Go through your things \"as though you're helping a friend and none of your stuff means anything to you,\" she says.   That attitude can help you let go of things you don't need but feel sentimental about, like the dented frying pan you've had since college, or extra items you keep around just in case, like the five wooden spoons in your utensil drawer.  4. Ditch the fancy storage boxes  Decluttering doesn't have to come with a hefty price tag, says Hansen. Most of the time, the containers you need to organize your stuff are already in your clutter somewhere – so shop your own closet first, she says. Instead of buying new drawer organizers, use old shoeboxes, gift boxes or even Tupperware. Be creative, says Hansen — that's one of the joys of decluttering.  Hansen likes using old iPhone boxes, for example, to store small items. They're sturdy enough to last a long time and can be used for anything from jewelry to office supplies.  5. Make it easy to stay organized It's easy to be organized the day after decluttering, when tidiness is still top of mind. But what happens when you come home from a trip and are too tired to unpack your luggage? Or when you get the flu and are too sick to clean up? The key to staying organized is to create practices that can be easily maintained, says Hansen. \"Make a system that works for you even when you've got to work, when you've got a cold.\" For example, label storage containers on all four sides so they're easier to spot. Make sure  your most used items are always the easiest to reach.  Most importantly, she says, celebrate your progress as you go. \"Brag to your friend, show your spouse, allow yourself to really enjoy the fact that you've done something,\" she says. \"It's not a small thing to get a handle on our clutter.\" More great organizing tips from Life Kit Organize your kitchen cabinets.

Give a little, get a lot with NPR Plus. ANDEE TAGLE, HOST:   This is NPR's LIFE KIT. I'm Andee Tagle, a reporter for this show. And also, I'm a bit of a mess, literally. Looking at my desk, I see reminder Post-its in every color lining my computer screens, hair ties hanging off the pens in my trusty pen cup, dusty photobooth pictures from a wedding last spring, a leftover candy wrapper from yesterday's afternoon snack and four - yes, four - different water cups and water bottles, amazingly, all half empty, in or around my immediate space. I share this embarrassing, overly cluttered truth with you because I could use some help. Are you ready to jump into it? STAR HANSEN: I am, yeah. TAGLE: Lucky for me, Star Hansen specializes in fresh starts. HANSEN: I'm a certified professional organizer and clutter whisperer. TAGLE: Star's decluttering philosophy has been featured everywhere, from HGTV to the OWN network to a TED Talk. She's all about understanding the story behind the messes we make for ourselves and getting to the why of the things that take up space in our lives. HANSEN: Clutter does speak to us. Clutter is talking to us because we are talking to ourselves through our clutter. And so what becomes clutter and where your clutter accumulates says a lot about what's going on with you. TAGLE: So my desk? It's shouting at me about busy workdays and procrastination and fast approaching deadlines. I like to call the mess in my office creative chaos. But if I'm really being honest, all that stuff probably impedes my work more than it helps. And there are a lot of different things in life like this. HANSEN: Clutter looks like anything you can imagine. Clutter looks like the way we talk to ourselves. It looks like our calendar. It looks like our Netflix queue. You know, it's not just physical stuff. It's anything that is causing chaos in our lives. TAGLE: So what can we do about it? Star says the first step is setting any shame aside. HANSEN: What we want to do is start looking at our clutter with curiosity instead of judgment. TAGLE: Then accept that decluttering isn't a one-time fix. It's an ongoing process that requires reflection, not just pretty boxes and a label maker, But we'll talk about that part of it, too. HANSEN: You know, it's like we have this assumption that we should just jump and get rid of things, right? Thanks to all the, like, makeover shows and all of that, it's just, like, so easy. Just get rid of it. But it's not, right? The more that people address that deeper root of the clutter, the easier it is to release the clutter. TAGLE: In this episode of LIFE KIT, the art of decluttering. We'll talk with Star about how to find the root of those emotional attachments to your stuff, tips for letting go and strategies for creating intentional clutter-free spaces that stick. Star, in every place I've lived, no matter how organized I am, no matter how big or small the space, no matter, you know, what good intentions I go in with it with, I always, always end up with a junk drawer. You know, it starts as the utility drawer - you know, batteries, that spare thing of scissors, tape, things like that. And then inevitably, it just gets away from me - every takeout menu, a catchall for my condiment packets or just, you know, napkins. You get the picture. I don't need to go on. But it's a habit that I just can't seem to shake, and it haunts me. What might that clutter be saying to you? HANSEN: Well, let's dive into the superficial level first, which is just we're busy and it's not a priority. Like, would you rather get rest, sleep eight hours tonight, or clear your junk drawer? Would you rather, you know, cuddle with your puppy or clear your junk drawer? Like, it's just not a high-priority activity. So that's part of it. So we just want to name that and let it be OK. That ideally stops us from feeling that shame and guilt build up. The second part is - the junk drawer is a great example of an unhoused, you know, graveyard basically. So, like, where do the things go that don't have a home? TAGLE: Yeah. HANSEN: And generally speaking, it's because we're not quite sure of like, oh, I don't know, do I want that? You know, I might need that extra silverware set from takeout. TAGLE: And then never, ever use them. HANSEN: Totally. And also, too, you're bumping up against those feelings that we have in a disposable, consumer-driven society, which is what a waste. What a waste of that tree that created the chopsticks. What a waste of the plastic that's housing the chopsticks. So we're not just dealing with clutter, we're looking at our value system. So you holding on to those chopsticks is you saying, I don't want to waste on our beautiful, precious planet. And it's really complicated because we live in a world where to not accumulate excess requires a next level veracity of, like, saying no. And then we wonder why we're all kind of drowning in stuff. We have so much thrown at us all the time. TAGLE: What about if you live with someone who has a very different clutter personality than you? So, for example, I tend towards maximalism when it comes to decor. My partner is very much team clean, open spaces. HANSEN: So what's really important is you want to make sure that you all have established your safe spaces. So - and when I say safe spaces, I just mean, where are you allowed to clutter? Because every person should be able to behave with their stuff the way that they naturally need to and want to because sometimes people need and want a chaotic energy around them. If you look at artists, have you ever walked into an artist's studio that was, like, perfectly organized and minimalist? TAGLE: Yeah, it's not clutter. It's creative chaos. HANSEN: Totally. I have a client who's neurodivergent, and she thrives in having her clothes everywhere. And her husband has been diagnosed with OCD, and he can't tolerate it. So they have to create different corners of the house that are for them. Then you want to come together and say, OK, great, consciously, what are we choosing for this room? What are the rules and guidelines for this room? And this is tricky because a lot of times, we move into the house and we are just, you know, hobbling over that finish line, dragging ourselves by one fingernail to cross. And we barely have energy to unpack boxes, let alone set up intentions... TAGLE: Right. HANSEN: ...And set up rules for, you know, life. So it's really important that you take the time. It doesn't matter if you moved in five years ago or five days ago, taking the time to say, wow, I'm noticing that we are having some incongruence in this room. Can we get on the same page? Because one of the things that's really important is for some people, clutter is not something you're going to just eliminate. You're not going to suddenly become a minimalist. And what we want to do is stop judging people who experience clutter in their lives and who it's part of how they process. TAGLE: That's great. What I'm hearing there, just, like, in many other facets of relationships, is that there's going to be some compromises, and everyone needs their own space, too. Is clutter a problem if it doesn't bother you? Does clutter only become a problem when it bothers you? HANSEN: It is only a problem if it's a problem for you. And it's really important that we mind our own side of the street because, again, you don't know what someone is going through. It sounds like I'm very pro-clutter, and in some ways I am. It is OK to have your clutter. It is OK to have a layer of chaos and disorganization in your life. If we can be OK with that, it allows us to stop the shame, stop the judgment, start to see what the root of it is so we can actually have a chance of letting it go. As long as we're judging and shaming and attacking ourselves, that clutter is going to hold tight because we need it, you know, to, like, protect ourselves. But the minute that you can say no, you know, it's OK that it's here, and no thank you to your opinion very much, this is how I'm living my life, and it's my journey and I'm going to walk it on my own - that's a much stronger position for you to be in because then the clutter is your choice. TAGLE: We're adults, and we get to make the rules. HANSEN: Exactly. Exactly. TAGLE: I'd love to move into the practical a little bit. Any specific tips for making incremental progress on your clutter? HANSEN: So when it comes to home organizing, you do really want to start in the easiest place first. I don't recommend starting with the most emotional things or paperwork - you know, memorabilia and paperwork are two things that I say, please save that for further down the line because those two tend to be the most emotionally triggering. We are looking at organizing as creating a skill set. Like, most people, if they have recurring clutter, do not feel like they have a handle on the process of organizing. And so you don't want to start, you know, with the most difficult thing first. Like, if you were going to go for a run, you're not going to choose to run the Big Sur marathon at a... TAGLE: Sure. Lifting weights - you go with five pounds before 10 pounds HANSEN: You, like, ease in, yeah. But then the other thing is when we look at how the mainstream world talks about organizing, they're talking about creating systems. They're talking about putting things in a pretty box with a label and giving it a home, right? And oftentimes, they're also talking about letting go of things. So in my experience, those are two very small pieces of a much bigger puzzle. When it comes to getting organized, if you're only trying to do those two things - getting rid of things or setting up systems. You are missing a lot of other really important stuff that creates organization and maintains organization. TAGLE: Star says she's big about setting an intention for a space. So look around that messy office or living room and think... HANSEN: What is it that I want to do in this room? How do I want it to feel? And, you know, what do I want it to look like? How do I know what to keep and get rid of? TAGLE: For me, it's the bedroom. I store a lot of my clothes under my bed. To be fair to me, my apartment is super short on storage. But also, I have a really hard time letting go of clothes. And they can sometimes take over our bedroom entirely. Star says to help, start thinking about three to five activities you want to do in the room. HANSEN: You're going to sleep. You're going to store clothes. You're going to connect with your partner, right? Those are maybe three things that we would say in that space. And we would pull all the clothes out. And I always tell people, don't make decisions as you go. What you want to do is you want to look at your stuff with neutral eyes, like as though you're helping a friend and none of your stuff means anything to you. TAGLE: OK. HANSEN: Just pull them all out, and then you want to put them into categories in a clear, neutral space. So, like, say, on top of the bed. So what you want to do is all jeans go here. All T-shirts go here. All socks go here. So you categorize everything all together. Then, once you've pulled everything out and it's all in categories, then you want to go through each pile and make a decision. Does this stay or go, stay or go? That's what we're kind of looking for, right? And then once you've gone through all the piles, one pile at a time - and we're looking at doing that the easiest to the hardest. So if you're like, oh, jeans are my kryptonite, save that for the end. Socks - I need to get rid of socks. Start there. Whatever's easy, start there. Go through each pile. And then once you're done going through everything, you want to take all those things that you're going to get rid of and get them out right then because you want to give yourself that openness, that freedom, that space to think. As long as you're looking at things you already made the decision to get rid of, you're kind of keeping yourself stuck in the past. So get it to the car to be donated or by the door. TAGLE: Physically move it out of that space. HANSEN: Yeah, get it out of there. And then you want to go through each pile and you want to say, OK, where am I going to store this? That's when we're talking about building systems. OK, great. Well, I want all my T-shirts hung, so you hang your T-shirts. I want all of the jeans folded and put into this bin underneath my bed. Fold it, put it underneath there, label it on all four sides, shove it under there. You're going to go through each category in that way. When we look at the concept of clutter as a whole, it's like one giant blob of chaos versus, oh, what am I going to do with my jeans? What am I going to do with my tank tops? And it becomes easier to dial in to. TAGLE: Once you found a home for everything, Star says it's time to personalize your space and make it beautiful. HANSEN: If you put some things in the closet, for example, do you want to paint the wall green? Do you want to hang a painting from your aunt? What do you want in there that reminds you of you and makes you feel happy? Because no one wants to live in a surplus store, you know? We want to feel personal. So what you want is that when you open that door, when you go underneath the bed, there's something that just makes you feel happy and peaceful and recognize yourself. Because when you decorate or when you kind of personalize a space, it stops you from adding more clutter. There's something about it that we won't kind of defile an area if we feel an endearment to it. And then from there, you want to decide, what's your maintenance plan, right? So it's pretty. It's set up. Now how am I going to maintain this? What I always tell people is make your maintenance systems for your laziest day. We all are superheroes when we are well-rested and, like, feeling good. And the truth is what happens when you come home from traveling? What happens when you get the flu? Those are the moments where we really lose our systems because suddenly we've gotten lost because things didn't go according to plan. TAGLE: It makes sense to me that, you know, when things are pretty, when they feel good, it's easier to have that investment and hopefully a long term investment, right? You want to give yourself the ability to invest in these things. But on that note, there are a lot of - there's a lot of beautiful and also very expensive ways to get organized these days. You know, I'm thinking about Instagram ads very aesthetic containers and all the videos I see for people's immaculate walk-in pantries? Does decluttering have to come with a price tag? HANSEN: What I have found in all my years of organizing is in every pile of chaos is the solution, meaning that when I come into somebody's house and we're organizing an entire room, yes, I could go and buy bins and boxes, but I have never not found the organizing solution buried in the chaos. We all have bought boxes over the years that then become clutter or, you know, things that we had best intentions with. So, yes, look, the organizing industry is a $12 billion a year industry and growing, right? It's just getting bigger and bigger. So it's an industry, just like anything else, and it wants you to spend money and do all of that. For some people, they really, really want that. You do not need to do that, right? A lot of these systems are hidden. A lot of these systems, you are never going to look out again, you know? And so what you're looking for is function more than anything else. I promise you, there is something in your house that you can use for that, even if it's, like, a box from your iPhone that you're not using anymore. But the quality is so good you don't want to get rid of. TAGLE: I have so many of those. HANSEN: Totally. Well, they make... TAGLE: (Laughter). HANSEN: ...They're so good, and they make great, like, drawer organizers. You just take those little inserts out, put them in the drawers. They're amazing. They'll last forever. So just knowing that you have this option to shop from within your own home is really powerful. And it's really important to take the time to create systems that work for you and how you really think. TAGLE: Yeah. It's not a one size fits all. This is up to you and how you want to do it, so make it fun. Make it fun where you can. What about decluttering tips for small spaces, or maybe storage ideas for small spaces? HANSEN: So the smaller your space, the more intentional you have to be. You might want to really lean in and have, like, oh, I want to keep this and this and this. But if you're in a small space, you have to have those three questions that I asked you really dialed in. What are the three to five activities you want to do in the space, how do you want it to look and how do you want to feel? You need to live from that like it's your Bible, like nothing exists in that space that isn't in alignment with those values because you just don't have the space for it. And it's really vital that we say, this is my intention and I'm moving forward. So when it comes to those spaces, you want to - yes, of course - like, have things that are multi-functional. Maximize the vertical space of your home. You know, organize and hang things on walls and in closets and really do as much dual functionality as you can. Also, see what you can get away with when it comes to multi-use items. TAGLE: Sure. That makes sense. So just really taking the time to be thoughtful about it. Maybe you have a couch that you'd really like to keep so that you don't have to buy a new couch. But if you have to walk diagonal in your studio apartment all the time, then it's not going to do you much good. HANSEN: Yeah. And, you know, we live in this wonderful time where you don't have to buy things all the time. There's infinite options for how you can source things without spending a lot of money. So I'm not saying go and spend a million dollars, but what I'm saying is get clear about what the right solution is. Stop living with the version that doesn't work for you. When you're in small spaces, you don't have the luxury of holding on to something because it's good enough or it used to work. You've got to be very sharp and clear about how you're going to use those spaces and map them out and then find the right things. And it might take time, but that's really, really vital in small spaces. TAGLE: I want to touch a little bit on relief versus completion. When you're tackling big projects or when you're just in the middle of it and you can't see your way through, can you talk to us a little bit about how to avoid overwhelms and some tips or strategies for - you know, for staying on top of it and not losing the thread? HANSEN: Absolutely. You can say, I'm not going to be in servitude to this clutter. I am choosing to take X amount of time to devote to clearing this clutter. So instead of saying, I'm going to take as long as this clutter takes to get organized - because the truth is, you could spend five hours on a pile of clutter, 20 minutes on a pile of clutter or five days on a pile of clutter, and you get to determine how long. So you could say, I'm willing to give this one hour. And in one hour, you just make it better. You don't have to get it completed fully, all the way done, because that's a moving target. You can just say, I'm willing to give this an hour and really give yourself that hour, and do the best that you can. Like, sometimes getting organized is not about this thorough, down-to-the-needle, you know, process. Sometimes it's just, I just need to walk in this room. And so that might look like you just walking through with a garbage bag and grabbing everything that's trash that you can see with your eye, or the same with donations. Or saying, I only have an hour, but I need to walk in this room and boxing things up and stacking it so that it gives you a breezeway, like, a real walkway. And so you really have to notice, like, OK, what is it that I need from this process right now? What kind of resources am I able to devote to it? Because again, we have this idea that we're supposed to, like, get it all done. And it's like, that's not always the case. And what if that's OK? What if this is you accomplishing something very big in small, manageable steps? What if that's enough? And I promise you it is, because it's not - the people who stay organized are not the ones who go and get the house renovation and do the whole thing in one weekend. That leads to backsliding, oftentimes. It's the people who stay consistent and keep moving through, a step at a time. Those are the people who really experience long-term organization. So just keep moving forward. That's the most important thing. TAGLE: That was Star Hansen, a professional organizer, also known as the Clutter Whisperer. By the way, Happy New Year.

challenge to grace periods for mail ballot returns \n         By Ashley Lopez \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 10:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday it will hear a case that could decide whether states can count postmarked mail ballots that arrive after Election Day — something that about 20 states and territories currently allow. Mississippi is one of those states, and in June, its top election official  asked the court  to hear a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee that argues the state's five-day mail ballot grace period violates federal law. An appeals court sided with the RNC. The ruling, which came while voters were casting ballots in last year's presidential election, did not go into effect immediately. Sixteen states plus Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C. , currently accept and count mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day — typically, only if those ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day. More states have grace periods like that just for military and overseas voters. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       States provide this wiggle room to voters in case they forget to return their mail ballots ahead of time, if there are issues with the postal service, or if there are other unforeseen issues like bad weather and natural disasters. The GOP has argued that Congress alone — not states — has the right to decide when elections end, and that Congress established a uniform Election Day. The RNC filed multiple legal challenges to various state grace period laws ahead of the 2024 election, including in the swing state of Nevada. Since then,  GOP-led states including Utah have eliminated their mail ballot grace periods , and President Trump has  sought to end them nationally via executive order . During the 2024 election, hundreds of thousands of mail ballots were counted that were received by officials after Election Day. In Washington state, for instance, where the vast majority of voters cast mail ballots, officials  reported  that \"more than 250,000 Washington ballots postmarked on time arrived after Election Day.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Joyce Vance, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law,  told NPR last year  that Republicans are \"trying to set up a possible rule for the future where only ballots that are cast and counted on Election Day count,\" which she said made more sense for voting patterns a hundred years ago. \"It doesn't reflect the modern reality where we have early voting days and have mail-in voting days precisely to accommodate the fact that not everybody can get away during normal business hours on a Tuesday to vote,\" she said. The Mississippi case becomes the third related to voting taken up by the Supreme Court this term. Justices are considering another mail-ballot case that centers on  whether candidates have standing to sue over voting regulations , and  a high-profile challenge to the Voting Rights Act . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5178103","dateOfPublication":"2025-03-28","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"10 Road Safety Do's and Don'ts That Might Just Save Your Life","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article, authored by Marielle Segarra and Malaka Gharib and published on March 28, 2025, offers a comprehensive list of 10 road safety do's and don'ts based on expert advice from Hector Carias, a California Highway Patrol officer.

Buckle your seat belt. Use your turn signal. Stop at the red light. But there may be scenarios on the road that you feel less prepared for. What should you do if your car starts to skid on ice? If someone is being aggressive toward you on the highway? If your car falls into a body of water? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hector Carias, an officer with the California Highway Patrol, explains what to do in these emergency situations. The key is to stay vigilant, he says. \"Driving should take 100% of your concentration, 100% of the time. Being defensive behind the vehicle can only bring positive outcomes.\" Motor vehicle crashes are  a leading cause of death  in the United States, killing more than 120 people everyday, according to 2022 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But they are preventable. Carias, who works out of CHP's Central Division office in Fresno, Calif., shares his top road safety do's and don'ts. 1. DON'T speed.  It can make it harder to avoid potential hazards on the road, and it can make car crashes more severe, Carias says. If someone is tailgating you, \"move over one lane and let them pass. There's no reason for you to speed up.\" 2. DO call 911 if you're being threatened by another driver . \"If someone is brandishing a firearm or a car has been following you, contact 911,\" Carias says. Don't engage. Officers will send help. If they can't get to your location on the highway, \"Don't stop. Our dispatch will stay on the phone with you and give you directions to a designated location, where an officer will try to meet you.\"  3. DON'T slam the brakes if you have engine trouble on the highway.  If your car stalls or runs out of gas on the road, put your hazard lights on right away and release the accelerator, Carias says. \"Try to veer to the right shoulder of the freeway and come to a safe stop,\" then call roadside assistance or 911.  4. DO hop into the passenger seat while waiting for help in the right shoulder lane.  It can be safer than sitting in the driver's seat. You want to position yourself as far away from traffic as possible. And buckle up, Carias says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       5. DO get as far away from your car as possible if you see smoke or flames coming out of the engine.  In the event of a car fire, pull over, turn off the engine and move yourself at least 100 feet away from the burning vehicle,  according to  the U.S. Fire Administration. Don't try to fight the fire. 6. DO slow down in extreme rainy conditions.  \"Give yourself more time to be reactive\" to road hazards, Carias says. And turn on your headlights.   Rain can make it hard to see the road and for other drivers to see you. \"I have a little saying that goes, 'if your wipers are going, your headlights are glowing.'\" 7. DON'T accelerate or slam the brakes if you're skidding on ice.  \"Once you've already started sliding, you're kind of going along for the ride,\" Carias says. Cautiously turn your wheel in the direction you want the car to go, and straighten the wheel as you feel the car straighten out,  according to AAA . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       8. DON'T turn on your high beams in heavy fog.  \"Fog is essentially water molecules. Shining bright light at those molecules is just going to reflect that light back to you and make it harder to see,\" Carias says. Instead, turn on your headlights and fog lamps if you have them. 9. DO unbuckle your seatbelt and start to roll down the windows the moment your car falls into a body of water.  \"Don't try to open the door,\" Carias says. Once a vehicle is more fully submerged, the pressure from the water against the windows and doors  can make it difficult to open them .  Escape through the open window and exit to safety. If you can't roll down the window, \"do your best to shatter the window using your elbow or whatever you can,\" Carias says. For peace of mind, purchase a window punch to keep in your car. 10. DO keep emergency supplies in your car.  That includes a first aid kit, water, jumper cables, a flashlight and blankets, Carias says. AAA  also recommends  keeping a basic set of tools and road flares or reflectors.  This episode was produced by Margaret Cirino. The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane.

You might need to change the way you sleep \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Thursday, October 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Ever wake up with a sore lower back or achy shoulders that just ruin the rest of your day? Or get up from bed and try to greet the morning, only to find your neck is too stiff to turn to the window? Morning muscle pain along your spine is often the result of hours of improper support while sleeping, says  Ellen Wermter , a nurse practitioner who runs  Restorative Sleep Medicine , a sleep clinic in Virginia. One easy way to guard against it, say medical experts, is to focus on your sleep posture. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sleeping in an awkward position tends to create gaps between your body and your pillow or mattress, Wermter says. \"Your soft tissue is going to want to sag into those gaps, and the muscles tense to make up for that\" in order to protect against potential injury. Over the course of a night, that muscle tension can cause inflammation and pain, Wermter says — and bad sleep from all that tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position. Whether you sleep on your back, side or stomach, experts share advice for those looking to minimize morning aches and pains. Sleep the same way you stand  The best defense against an achy neck or back   in the morning is to sleep just like you stand, Wermter says.   When you sleep in a position that follows the natural curvature of your spine, it reduces the possibility of muscle strain. While lying down, your body should form a straight line from the top of your head to your tailbone. Wermter suggests placing   your ears over your shoulders and your shoulders over your hips. Point   your chin straight ahead, not tucked into your chest or stretched up toward the sky. Aim for symmetry with your arms for proper circulation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you're a back sleeper, this tip will be easier to follow. But if you're a side or stomach sleeper, you may need to adjust your sleep space for better spinal alignment — or even train yourself to sleep in this position, Wermter says. Avoid sleeping on your stomach  While this position can open up airways for struggling snorers, it's often associated with its potential downsides, Wermter says. That includes neck, back and shoulder aches, and fragmented sleep from switching positions more often throughout the night. When you sleep on your stomach, it's easy to overextend your neck, she says. Creating breathing room for yourself often pulls your neck out of that ideal spinal alignment. Choose the right pillow for your head   It's important to rest your head on something that supports your spine and promotes maximum restfulness at night, says  Dr. Fabian Morales , a sports medicine physician. Back sleepers:  Morales suggests a pillow with medium firmness and loft, or something with an ergonomic design. \"A good orthopedic pillow designed to support the curvature of the neck can minimize your risk of neck pain down the line. It reduces pressure on the neck and supports alignment,\" he says. Side sleepers:  To find a pillow with the right loft for side sleeping, \"measure from the bend of your neck to the edge of your shoulder,\" Wermter says. The ideal pillow will support your head without pushing your head and neck further up. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Stomach sleepers:  If you're stuck on stomach sleeping, Wermter says it might be best to go without a pillow to avoid extra strain on your neck. If you do need some cushion, aim for low-loft options to keep your spine aligned. Replace your pillows every few years or as soon as you notice your pillow starts to lack support, Morales says. Pillows hold on to dirt and dust — and they lose their structure over time, which can lead to aches and pains. Support any gaps with smaller pillows  When your spine isn't properly supported, pain is likely to follow, Wermter says. That's why it's important to align and cradle the entire length of your spine — not just your head and neck — to make up for any gaps between your body and the mattress. Use smaller pillows or even rolled up blankets or towels. Back sleepers:  Be mindful of any gaps at the small of your back or under your knees, which can be a source of lower back pain. Add support to those areas as needed, Wermter says. Side sleepers:  Many side sleepers like placing a small pillow between the knees or hugging a body pillow to align the hips and reduce pressure in the hips and lower back, she says. Stomach sleepers:  Wermter says just sleeping on a flat surface is fine for stomach sleepers, but some may find that a thin pillow under the hips and stomach can reduce strain on the back. Opt for a mattress that's not too soft and not too firm  Evaluate the quality of your mattress and replace your bed every seven years at most, says Wermter. If a mattress is too soft, the heavier parts of your body can sink and your spine will likely get out of alignment. If a mattress is too firm, it can create those pain-inducing gaps between body and bed. Try other pain relief remedies  What should you do if you have a great sleep setup and you still wake up with an achy back or a crick in your neck? It's a very common experience, especially as we age and our spines experience more wear and tear, says  Dr. Charla Fischer,  an   orthopedic spine surgeon at NYU Langone Health. That kind of muscle pain can be, well, a pain in the neck — but is usually not cause for major concern. Consult a medical professional if you have consistent pain for a week or more; experience numbness, tingling or weakness in the neck, arms or hands; or if you just have concerns, Fischer says. Otherwise, don't forget the power of basic pain relief remedies. Take  over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication , massage the area, do gentle stretches, or place ice or heating packs in 20- to 30-minute bouts on your body. Don't underestimate the power of a hot shower, she says. \"It can go a long way in calming down those unhappy muscles.\" This story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan.

Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KYIV and KHARKIV, Ukraine — Maryna Mytsiuk spends her free time at a shooting range outside Kyiv, hyper-focused on hitting her targets. She's got to practice. She's waiting for a call that, any day, will send her to war. \"Of course, I'd like to be in a combat position,\" said Mytsiuk, a 27-year-old folklore scholar who speaks Japanese and works at a nonprofit. \"With my build and height, I'm not a natural fit for that … so I'm training very hard.\" She is among a growing number of Ukrainian women joining the military as Russia's full-scale war on the country nears its fourth year, and troops remain in short supply. This comes as the fighting appears no closer than it was when President Trump took office in January vowing to quickly broker peace. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Mytsiuk said the Ukrainian military has become much more receptive to women since the early days of the full-scale invasion, when Ukrainian men were lining up at recruitment centers to become soldiers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She wanted to sign up, too, but was told she would be best off in the kitchen, she said, \"where I could make dumplings.\" Mytsiuk, however, plowed ahead. She enrolled at a military university for a second degree, graduating this summer. She looked into several brigades and applied to those with special forces units. She had difficult conversations with her mother and her boyfriend, a soldier. Both strongly oppose her decision. \"I see women my age getting married, having children,\" she said. \"I can't help having thoughts, like am I doing the right thing? But there's no turning back now.\" Sooner or later, she said, she believes everyone in Ukraine who is able to will have to fight, especially with no ceasefire deal on the horizon. Soldiers by choice Men between the ages of 25 and 60 can be drafted in Ukraine, but women are exempt. \"We are volunteers choosing to fight,\" Mytsiuk says. Ukraine's military  says  more than 70,000 women were serving in the country's armed forces as of January. Oksana Hryhorieva, the military's gender adviser, says though that's only about 8% of the country's total armed forces, the number of women has risen 40% since 2021. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Until parliament passed a 2018 law,\" she said, \"the military was patriarchal, and women were not legally allowed to serve in combat positions or study all disciplines at military universities.\" Women who joined battalions when Russia invaded parts of eastern and southern Ukraine in 2014 did fight on the front line but were classified as noncombatants. \"For example,\" Hryhorieva said, \"we had biathletes who were great snipers, but according to their documents, they were cooks. It was totally unfair.\" Now, she says, women make up about 20% of military cadets and thousands are officially serving in combat positions. They include  fighter pilots ,  artillery commanders , drone operators and engineers. NPR met several women serving in various military units this year. Some brigades, including Khartiia and Azov, which are both part of Ukraine's National Guard, feature women in their advertising campaigns. In one popular Azov  recruitment video  released this summer, two dads in a car shop talk about their kids. One says his son is trying to find a job at a critical enterprise to exempt him from military service. The other says he has a daughter — and she's a soldier. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Khartiia 13th National Guard Brigade,  founded  by a Ukrainian billionaire in early 2022 as a volunteer battalion, is based in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. It's well-resourced and an innovator in robotic warfare.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This spring, the brigade launched a female-centered recruitment campaign  featuring  a soldier in the ground robotic systems division named Jess. She is shown on a field, a white ribbon tying back her red hair, testing land drones that are used to deliver water, food, fuel and ammunition to soldiers in front-line positions. \"I am the only woman in this unit,\" she says. \"I am 21 years old.\" The drone operators \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a Khartiia camp in northeastern Ukraine earlier this year, two drone pilots — Yevheniia and Dasha — examined newly assembled first-person view (FPV) drones at a small hut with a 3D printer. The scent of shorn wood, metal and instant coffee wafts through the air. NPR is using only the drone pilots' first names and call signs at the request of the Ukrainian military, which cited security concerns. Yevhenia, 19, resembles Arya Stark from  Game of Thrones . She uses the military call sign \"Furia,\" after the ancient Greco-Roman goddesses who punished evildoers for their sins. She said male soldiers often ask her: What are you doing here? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"And I say, I have to be here, and that's that,\" she said. \"And why drones?\" she added. \"I think because I love to play computer games.\" She and Dasha were among three women in an FPV drone unit of 15. Dasha, 23, is tall and stern. She uses the call sign \"Galactica.\" She was briefly married and, before the war, was making plans to become a police officer. Dasha said her mother wept when she left for basic training. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"My mother wanted me to stay at home, be a wife, have children,\" Dasha said. \"And I chose what she calls a man's profession, living with a constant threat on my life.\" Another drone operator in the unit is in a muddy field a short drive from camp. Daria is a former software engineer in her early 30s. She is testing a new aerial drone as the sun sets. \"A lot of my relatives don't even know I'm here,\" she said. \"They say, 'She needs to go to Europe and be in some safe place.'\" Daria volunteered as a humanitarian worker in the early days of the full-scale invasion, working 20 hours a day shuttling food and other supplies to front-line areas. She never felt like she was doing enough. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I'm Ukrainian, I'm a part of this country, and I need to help,\" she said. She learned how to assemble and fly first-person-view drones, which are outfitted with video cameras and guidance systems controlled remotely. Some brigades told her there weren't many jobs for \"girls\" but Khartiia welcomed her drone skills. \"Here,\" she said, \"they knew what to do with me.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She said she has lost touch with many friends since joining the military. Male friends have fled the country to avoid the draft. She said she has struggled not to judge them. \"It's their choice,\" she said, frowning. \"They can do what they want to do. I can't say, 'Everybody needs to be like me.' Though I want [to], honestly.\" The medic Earlier this year in the city of Sumy, also in northeastern Ukraine, a combat medic who had just left the front line walked into a beauty salon. Olena Ivanenko, who goes by the call sign \"Ryzh,\" was exhausted. She slumped in a plush chair, then closed her eyes as a beautician shaped her eyebrows, then polished her nails. \"I know that in three days my nails will be grimy again,\" she said. \"But looking at clean nails for one day gives me such relief and pleasure. For me, it's as routine as breakfast.\" Ryzh is 44 and ran restaurants before joining the military in 2023. She was with the 47th Mechanized Brigade before joining 412 Nemesis, a brigade in Ukraine's unmanned systems, this year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I decided after three months of service that I would stay in the army forever,\" she said. \"I will not return to civilian life. I feel very comfortable here. I feel like I am 100,000, million percent in my place.\" Her service has also brought considerable heartbreak. She calls them \"the dark dates.\" In one battle in 2023, many in her unit died, including one of her closest friends. \"He was the first to get blown up,\" she said, \"and I pulled him out of the dugout. This is probably the hardest thing for me in the whole war so far.\" Ryzh herself was wounded in the leg after a Russian tank fired at her. (She has since recovered.) She said she speaks a lot to civilians about what soldiers face on the front line. She has noticed the divide between soldiers and civilians growing. \"Soldiers say we are working for victory, and civilians say we want peace,\" she said. \"But peace and victory are different things.\" The military intelligence analyst At a Kyiv exhibition hall this spring, Ukraine's military intelligence unveiled state-of-the-art sea drones — and three members of the elite unit that operate them. A  Ukrainian cover  of the song \"Sonne\" by the German gothic metal band Rammstein blared as the soldiers strode onto the stage. They appeared in disguise, in balaclavas and sunglasses. When they spoke through microphones, their voices were distorted for security reasons. One was Xena, like the warrior-princess of the 1990s TV series. A version of these sea drones, equipped with rockets and machine guns,  downed  a Russian fighter jet in the Black Sea earlier this year. \"Our challenge,\" Xena said, \"is to lure the Russians out of their bases and then hunt them. We intend to keep adapting these sea drones until we can target and hit Russian fighter jets, helicopters and ships under any conditions.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Xena has been a military analyst for a decade and joined this elite unit after the full-scale invasion, which has fueled a rapid innovation of weapons in Ukraine. She said she's used to being the only woman on her team. \"And it's not easy,\" she said. \"I do feel support from my guys, but sometimes they can act like kids, you know? They see my support role as bringing them cookies or tea — or something like that.\" She laughed into her balaclava and said she has more important things to worry about, like staying alive. \"Motivation helps,\" she said. \"Motivation to win this war.\" A death, and a new life In early September, a large crowd filled St. Michael's domed cathedral in Kyiv for a soldier's funeral. As a military band played, pallbearers carried out the coffin past mourners kneeling in respect. The family clutched a framed portrait of the fallen soldier: a smiling young woman with wire-rimmed glasses. Daria Lopatina, 19, was an engineer with the special forces of the Azov brigade. She had dropped out of the Kyiv School of Economics to defend Ukraine. Saluting her coffin was Ruslan Shelar, who works at the Defense Ministry with Lopatina's father. Shelar said he has noticed more women enlisting, especially those under 25. He points out Lopatina was 8 years old when Russia backed paramilitaries to seize parts of eastern Ukraine and illegally annex Crimea in 2014 — before the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. \"She grew up with war,\" he said, \"surrounded by people who had taken part in it. Her path was set.\" Ukraine's armed forces do not disclose Ukrainian casualty figures, so it's unclear how many female soldiers have died. The stakes are clear to Maryna Mytsiuk, the new recruit in Kyiv waiting for her military assignment. \"I constantly think about it, about death,\" she said. \"But it's better to die on the battlefield than from a missile hitting your apartment in Kyiv. Better to die fighting than die on your knees.\" Olena Lysenko and Hanna Palamarenko contributed reporting from Kyiv. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5485337","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"08:26:00-05:00","title":"Sen.

Fetterman slams Democrats for shutting down government \n         By Scott Detrow, Tyler Bartlam, Ashley Brown \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 8:26 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) often finds himself at odds with his party. He's unapologetically  pro-Israel  at a time when fewer members of Democrats are. He spent the fall railing against the  federal government shutdown  and he, along with a few other Senate Democrats, broke from the party and struck a deal with Republicans. \"It's always been wrong for us to shut the government down,\" he told NPR. \"Rightly, [Democrats] criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down. It's wrong. It's reckless.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In an interview with  All Things Considered  host Scott Detrow, Fetterman posed a question to his critics: \"What exactly am I guilty of?\" \"I suffered from depression and I made a recovery and I won an election,\" he said. \"And I went on to be an unapologetic supporter of Israel. And I happen to think that we have to have a secure border and I think it's wrong to shut our government down.\" Fetterman spoke with NPR in a conversation tied to his new memoir,  Unfettered , about his 2022 Senate campaign that saw him suffer a stroke and fall into a deep depression. A video of the interview will be available to watch later today. The interview text below has been edited for length and clarity. Interview highlights Scott Detrow:  This is a book about an election cycle where you suffered a stroke and you struggled with serious depression. Sen. John Fetterman:  Profound depression. Honestly, I know millions of Americans suffer from it. And when you hear the expression that you can't get out of your bed — that's true. Detrow:  Last time I interviewed you, you had just returned to the Senate from Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center]. It was a pretty emotional conversation. You were still processing your treatment and what came next. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I wanted to ask a little bit about that because there's parts of this book where it seems like you're saying that you've, at times, regretted being so open about your mental health struggles. Is that accurate? Fetterman:  No. I don't regret it. But people have been willing to use it or to create an impression that's just not true. And it's an honest conversation because a lot of people have had those things. And I've had a lot of people reach out to me over the years since and it's an honor to speak to people, to their experience, because sometimes people can feel alone. And I've always wanted to make that conversation as simple as it can to just stay in this game. Because I've had people in my life make the decision to leave. And that's not a fail, they didn't fail. But that's a decision that they can't come back [from]. And how heartbreaking that is and how sad that is. Detrow:  You're talking about suicide. Fetterman:  Yeah, absolutely. It's not a weakness. And that's [I want to be] a voice saying, \"hey, look, that's a lie. I don't know what your recovery looks like, but as long as you stay in it, I promise you you will get better.\" Detrow:  I want to ask about Israel. You were very out front about [supporting Israel]. You never changed your tune. I'm wondering, as the Israeli attacks and bombing of Gaza continued, were there any points where you second guessed the place that you had staked yourself? Fetterman:  [Israel] had an opportunity to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities. I was the only Democrat that supported that. I was actually charging for those things. You know, that comes from Trump. Well, then I happen to agree with it. And now, can you imagine if they would have acquired a nuclear weapon there? And now what is behind this constant violence there? Is it Israel or it's because Iran funding these proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah doing these kinds of terrible things. And that war would have ended when you sent back all the hostages. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Detrow:  So, at no point in the conflict did the balance shift for you as you thought about this in the context of 69,000 Palestinians dead? Fetterman : No one breaks down how many actual Hamas fighters or other people that were involved in that. So, we're not really sure. The only time you see members in Hamas is when they're handing over funerals and rallying. Otherwise, they embed themselves in the civilians and they were forced to fight a war through an urban situation. Why can't people condemn putting tunnels under hospitals and embedding themselves in where civilians are? And you know, because they can't fight a real war. So, that's why they use civilians as human shields. And that's the tragedy.

     By Isabella Gomez Sarmiento \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The set-up for a typical Jesse Welles video is simple: the 32-year-old stands in an open field under a string of powerlines, clutching an acoustic guitar. From behind a tousled, curly mop of hair, he stares straight into the camera and starts singing. \"If you're in need of a gig that'll help you feel big, come with me and put some folks in detention,\" he deadpans in one song, a scathing critique of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. \"We can sneak around town, hunting working folks down, I hear they get a great benefit plan.\" \"Join ICE\" is just one of the dozens of songs Welles routinely shares on social media. They're often short and satirical tunes, riding on his coarse voice and fingerpicked guitar strings, that respond to the major headlines of the week. They challenge the narratives presented to Americans by governments and corporations; they draw historical parallels and unearth underlying tensions that lead people to blame one another for institutional injustices. On the Internet, Jesse Welles' songs are major hits. Thousands of people flock to the comments, calling him a modern day  Bob Dylan  or  Woody Guthrie . Since he started regularly posting clips last year, Welles has amassed more than 3 million followers on TikTok and Instagram combined, not to mention his over 600,000 YouTube subscribers. The Recording Academy has also taken notice; last week, Welles  received  four Grammy nominations in the folk and Americana categories. He's become one of the most visible examples of a new generation of digital-savvy artists bringing folk traditions to a modern medium. \"We've never been this informed,\" Welles tells NPR about Americans today. \"Pair being informed with being disempowered — being that aware and having so little hard influence on the aspects of your life that you're so awake to. I think that explains a lot of people's frustration.\" Welles wasn't always a country-leaning singer-songwriter. He spent years playing in different iterations of rock bands, experimenting with folk and  grunge . Nearly a decade ago, he signed to a label in Nashville, burnt out and went back home to Arkansas. In 2024, after his father suffered a heart attack, the now-independent artist says he had a spiritual awakening that put him on his current path. The songs began to pour out, some political and some not. So far, his music has addressed the  war in Gaza ,  the Epstein list  and the Trump administration's claims that Tylenol is  linked  to autism. Although Welles' lyrics skew pro-working class and anti-violence, fans trying to neatly categorize his political affiliations might run into trouble. In August, he raised some eyebrows when he appeared on  The Joe Rogan Experience . A month later, he released a song condemning the  assassination  of  Charlie Kirk . It sparked both praise and backlash. On TikTok and Instagram, some people questioned how Welles could mourn a man who often made bigoted statements about minorities and helped elect the same politicians the singer criticizes in his lyrics. Welles says that for him, there's no use in trying to control how people perceive him or how they attempt to project partisan lines onto his music. His bottom line, he says, is radical nonviolence. \"I visit a lot of different echo chambers. I pop in, pop out — see what's going on in different corners,\" Welles says. \"You start to wonder, where's the throughline? Because there's obviously an issue, but neither corners' justifications for their actions or reactions is really satisfying. So I think I just started looking for some sense.\" Audiences on and offline are right there with him. Welles released multiple studio albums this year, which include collaborations with rising Americana stars  Sierra Ferrell  and  Billy Strings . He was awarded the 2025 John Prine Songwriting Fellowship and performed at both Newport Folk Festival and Farm Aid. He's also been selling out shows across the country, where he's been joined onstage by  Joan Baez  and  John Fogerty . Welles' success shows that his music is resonating widely, as a new generation of artists revive bold, plainspoken protest music for today's digital age. A long tradition of protest songs Protest music has always been deeply embedded in the American fabric, but its popularity has come and gone. Tammy L. Kernodle, a musicologist and professor at Miami University, says there's been different moments throughout history in which the folk music of particular communities or ethnic groups has been used for mass mobilization. \"When we talk about folk music, we're talking about the music that developed out of the everyday experiences of people. It was part of their ritual,\" she explains. \"Within those repertoires, there's always been songs that have been about articulating people's frustration.\" Throughout the 20th century, folk music played a key role in organizing movements across labor, politics, race and gender. From the Great Depression to the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, the struggle for liberation played out explicitly in protest songs and implicitly in the emergence of new genres like rock, disco and hip-hop. But as the century came to a close, Kernodle says folk songs documenting people's realities and advocating for social change became less and less central to pop culture. \"When we started to move into the last decades of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, those messages started to be filtered out because of the infrastructure and how music became so vastly commodified because of globalization,\" Kernodle says. \"The industry began to work against it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the early to mid-2000s, major labels and mainstream radio stations mostly shied away from songs with overt political messaging, though folk, punk and protest scenes still flourished underground. With the rise of social media, it became easier for artists to bypass industry gatekeepers. In the last decade, hip-hop has largely carried the torch of musical protest,  particularly  during the Black Lives Matter  mobilizations  of 2020 and the rise of the COVID-19  pandemic . Today, anyone can write a song and upload it to the Internet, but they're also competing with a flood of information: a 24-hour news cycle, personalized algorithms and never-ending scrolling. With an increasingly fractured attention economy and a deeply polarized society, many people are looking for spaces of connection; communities that take their concerns seriously and make them feel heard. Kernodle says the simplicity of a front-facing camera and a banjo or guitar calls back to earlier folk traditions; simpler days of someone singing about their day on a front porch or in a town hall — and it carries real power. \"We are moving into a society that wants to read less. Most of us are getting our information from this very visual culture: TikTok, Instagram and all of these things,\" Kernodle explains. \"Music is also underscored. So these individuals are doing what their predecessors did, but on a different digital platform.\" How one artist cuts through the noise  One of those artists is Mon Rovîa, who's racked up more than 1 million followers across TikTok and Instagram, all before releasing his debut album. Born in Liberia during the West African nations' first civil war, he was adopted by an American missionary family as a child. Mon Rovîa moved around a lot growing up and gravitated towards reading and writing poetry; as he got older, he settled in Tennessee and began channeling his energy into music, initially dabbling with hip-hop and bedroom alt-pop. In 2022, he planted his feet into an Afro-Appalachian sound that blends indie folk influences like  Fleet Foxes  and  Bon Iver  with the musical traditions of the region he now calls home. He says music did not play a big role in his early childhood in Liberia — but given Appalachian folk music's  deep roots  in West African instruments and rhythms, Mon Rovîa's sound comes full circle, doubly honoring his identity. He writes guitar and ukulele-driven melodies that nudge his honeyed vocals to the forefront, often reminiscent of the intimate folk songs of British troubadour Labi Siffre. On TikTok, he'll share videos of himself playing and singing with friends, or will overlay his songs over clips of himself making tea. This kind of content is often at odds with the attention-grabbing, chaotic pace of the algorithm. Amid that slow tranquility, Mon Rovîa delivers messages against oppression, gun violence and war. \"A lot of times, the world is already too loud and angry,\" he tells NPR. \"Peace and thoughtfulness can cut through a lot of that noise.\" His song \"Heavy Foot,\" which he performed during his Grand Ole Opry debut this summer, rallies around collective care and empathy in the face of hostile politicians and systems of power. \"Do you see the man on the screen, just a puppet but you never see the strings,\" Mon Rovîa sings. \"Calling it a war 'n not a genocide, telling us it isn't what it seems.\" On social media, he's shared the song over clips of pro-Palestinian protests around the world, as well as with text that reads: \"'Who radicalized you?' I did NOT recite 'with liberty and justice for all' every morning at 7AM just to be called radical for wanting liberty and justice for all.\" Beyond social media, he also performed alongside Jesse Welles at this year's Newport Folk Festival and is selling out national tours. Although Mon Rovîa didn't initially set out to make protest music, he says he's embracing the movement. \"I think the important piece about protest music is the truth factor,\" he says. \"I think it becomes protest because we put that word around it, but really it's just a search for the truth. To reveal it and to say it as it is and not beat around the bush.\" He credits writers like  James Baldwin  and  Toni Morrison  with inspiring him to make art as a personal form of activism. Musicologist Kernodle says these links in time — in instruments, themes and influences — are an essential part of the protest folk tradition. \"True protest music does this. It reflects on the past. It is documenting the present, and what it is speaking to is the hope of the future,\" she says. \"That's what we see in some of this material that is coming out of these digital platforms.\" Looking at the future For 28-year-old singer-songwriter  Jensen McRae , that lineage is a grounding exercise for facing the current political climate. \"I have Post-it notes above my desk, and it just has a list of all of the Black women from history that I admire and am trying to model myself after,\" she tells NPR. \"It says, 'You're standing on the shoulders of your ancestors, you can get through this.' \" McRae is a 21st century Laurel Canyon-style folk singer with indie rock sensibilities. Raised in Los Angeles with a steady soundtrack of pop, R&B and  Carole King , she studied music at the University of Southern California. As a college student, she traded in piano for acoustic guitar as her primary instrument when she realized it was much easier to carry from gig to gig. She wanted to become a storyteller, and to her that meant writing folk songs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2021, she wrote a viral  Phoebe Bridgers   parody  track about getting the COVID-19 vaccine at Dodger Stadium. She's released two acoustic-pop albums since then, full of heartbreaking and incisive lyricism (she jokes that as a woman, people expect her to write songs about the worst thing that's ever happened to her — and she delivers). She's sold out shows on both sides of the Atlantic, opened for acts like  MUNA  and  Noah Kahan  and  found a fan  in none other than  Justin Bieber . This summer, she also appeared in Spike Lee's  Highest 2 Lowest . But as she's found more mainstream success, McRae has also felt a deep responsibility to respond to \"the historical moment that we're in that's been going on for basically my entire adult life.\" Online, she shares defiantly unpolished protest songs like \"You Started It\" and \"The Men are Disappearing\" to her more than 500,000 followers across TikTok and Instagram. Shot on McRae's phone, the stripped-down videos of her singing and strumming the guitar don't necessarily look out of place on her social media feeds. She's the kind of Internet native who regularly posts works-in-progress song clips, covers and snippets of herself reading old diary entries. But in her more political songs, pinned to the top of her TikTok profile, McRae touches on school shootings, racial injustice, the military industrial complex and the  deportation  of migrants from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador. She says that with how long it takes to craft an album, she's drawn to posting political songs online for the immediacy — she wants to meet the moment as it's happening. She also finds catharsis in not having to think about branding or marketing the music; instead, the songs are a tool for raising consciousness. \"There's a part of me that feels a little bit funny about profiting off of that music,\" she says, noting that her TikTok is not monetized. \"The reason that I'm writing it is to give other people the language to talk about this thing that maybe they don't understand.\" Existing as a folk artist closer to the pop mainstream, she sees her role akin to \"sneaking vegetables into people's brownies\" — sparking sociopolitical awareness in audiences that may not be overtly seeking it out. That in itself, she says, is a form of resistance. \"My hope is that in 30 or 50 years, my children or grandchildren will be living in a time where the pendulum has swung back in a more progressive direction,\" McRae says. \"They'll look back and go, 'Oh my God, I can't believe you were making art during that time when that administration and that court and those police forces were so conservative and were so combative.' I want to be a part of the reason why future generations feel like they can say anything and do anything.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604880","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"I'm pregnant but my doctor won't see me before 9 weeks.

Why not? Is it OK to wait? \n         By Mara Gordon \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 7:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Q: I just found out I'm pregnant. According to my period tracking app, I'm about five weeks along. But I can't get a first prenatal appointment until I'm nine weeks in. I'm super stressed out. Why can't I see a doctor sooner? And is it really OK to wait that long? First of all, congratulations! And don't worry. It's normal to want to see a doctor right away when you see those two side-by-side lines on a positive pregnancy test. But it's also pretty typical to have trouble getting an appointment to confirm you're pregnant. A physician friend of mine also recently went through this. Even with insider connections at her hospital, she couldn't see a doctor for another month. So she texted one of the OB/GYNs in her office and asked her to do an ultrasound between her scheduled appointments! My friend was lucky she could access this workaround. But I've always wondered why early pregnancy care isn't available to those of us who don't have an OB/GYN on speed dial. Many prenatal providers won't schedule patients until eight or nine weeks of pregnancy — at the earliest. Waiting a month to see a doctor isn't necessarily a bad thing, since most pregnancies will go on to be healthy. But it can feel like a  long  time, since most high-sensitivity home pregnancy tests  can confirm a pregnancy  on the first day of your missed period, which is usually around four weeks along. So if you're eager for an earlier appointment, here's what you should know. Do you have a medical question you’d like an honest answer on? Write us at  thrive@npr.org , and we’ll consider your question for the column. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A lot of people want earlier prenatal care In one 2016 study, about  15% of participants  said they couldn't get a first prenatal appointment as quickly as they wanted. Dr. Kavita Vinekar , an OB/GYN whose work focuses on early pregnancy, thinks that number might be even higher. Vinekar got interested in caring for patients in the earliest stages of pregnancy because it's such a vulnerable period. She surveyed patients at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia and learned that people were doing whatever they could to confirm the pregnancy, even if prenatal practices were turning them away. Close to 50% of patients had gotten an ultrasound somewhere else before their first prenatal appointment, while 25% had visited an emergency room.  Almost 15% of those who had gotten an ultrasound had been to what's known as a crisis pregnancy center, which offers anti-abortion counseling without licensed medical care. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Why it's hard to get these appointments Seeing patients in the first weeks of pregnancy, Vinekar says, is a radical departure from what many doctors learn during training. In the earliest stages, it's hard to give patients definitive answers about the health of the pregnancy. That's because it can be difficult to visualize an early pregnancy on an ultrasound. \"We have been told: 'Do not see people in early pregnancy,'\" Vinekar said. '\"You're just going to open up a whole can of worms. You're going to be creating stress when they don't need to be stressed.'\" But some patients are stressed when they  can't  see a doctor, especially if they're worried they might be having a miscarriage. Unfortunately, Vinekar says that miscarriage risk is actually a major reason why prenatal practices won't schedule patients early on. They aren't set up to take care of the  estimated 15% of pregnancies that will end in the first trimester , so they try to delay taking on patients until eight or nine weeks, when miscarriage is less likely. Early pregnancy loss can be tricky to diagnose and may require multiple urgent follow-up appointments. Also, practices may not want to leave those appointment slots open, because if nobody schedules, they could lose money. Here's what you can do while you wait If you're waiting on a first prenatal appointment but want medical advice sooner, your best option may be trying to see your primary care provider. If you have an OB/GYN, you could make an appointment with them, too. In my primary care practice, I often talk to patients who have just found out that they're pregnant. They have questions about everything from miscarriage risk to whether or not they can eat sushi. Many of my pregnant patients start feeling nauseous weeks before their first prenatal appointment is scheduled. They're frustrated they can't see an OB/GYN to get some relief. So instead, they call me — and I'm happy to help out. If you're experiencing nausea, heartburn, or breast tenderness but don't yet have an OB/GYN appointment, don't hesitate to call your family doctor or visit an urgent care. Even if we aren't experts in pregnancy, we can usually offer treatment for these common — and unpleasant — symptoms. What to do if you are worried about miscarriage As a family doctor, I sometimes get calls from pregnant patients who are bleeding and cramping and are worried they're having a miscarriage. First, don't panic. Light spotting in pregnancy can be normal. I usually do my best to get my patient in for an urgent ultrasound in a radiology practice with experience diagnosing early pregnancy and miscarriage. Unfortunately, that can also sometimes take several weeks. If you already have an OB/GYN, you can also make an urgent appointment with that doctor. If you don't see anyone for routine reproductive health care, a Planned Parenthood or a community health center may also be able to get you in. Since only an  estimated 4% of miscarriages require ER-level care , I try to reassure my patients that what they're experiencing usually isn't life-threatening. Unless they're having severe bleeding, it can be safe to wait it out. And, of course, I always tell my patients that if they've had a miscarriage, it isn't their fault. Most miscarriages are due to abnormalities in the developing fetus. It's almost never due to something they've done wrong. Still, most patients want to confirm if they're having a miscarriage right away. In that case, the ER is always an option. Doctors there can usually do an ultrasound and help get pain under control. But because miscarriage is a high-stakes diagnosis and  not all doctors are trained  in early pregnancy ultrasound, the ER may not be able to answer all your questions. Future solutions for early care I hate having to tell my patients all this, but our health care system doesn't do a great job of caring for patients who are having miscarriages — or have anxiety about early pregnancy. Take the story of Asha Spacek-Hobbs, who had a pregnancy loss before her youngest was born. The Philadelphia mom couldn't get an urgent appointment with an OB/GYN. She said it was \"like trying to book a flight to Antarctica.\" But the ER experience, she says, wasn't definitive either. \"I left the hospital, believe it or not, not totally knowing if I actually had a miscarriage,\" Spacek-Hobbs said. \"No one would actually say it.\" Vinekar has seen this all too many times. \"We've historically shied away and abandoned them,\" she said. \"Maybe that's actually the time they need us the most.\" That's why Vinekar and her team have started a clinic they call the Jefferson Early Pregnancy Program, which is almost like an urgent care for people who have just found out they're pregnant. When patients call in, they're offered appointments within a few days. Vinekar hopes these early pregnancy appointments can help patients get evidence-based miscarriage care right away — without waiting for hours in an emergency room. And she hopes her model will spread so it's easier for people around the country to get early pregnancy care. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/britain-bbc-crisis-trump-panorama-a392fb275af25216ea23537c6f4347e4","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:17:25+00:00","title":"Trump Threatens $1 Billion Lawsuit Against BBC Over Edited Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC faced intense political and public backlash over its editing of a January 6, 2021 speech by former U.S. President Donald Trump in a 'Panorama' documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?', which allegedly created a misleading impression that he called for violent action.

updates on President Donald Trump and his administration LONDON (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC over the way a speech he made was edited in a documentary aired by Britain’s national broadcaster. BBC chairman Samir Shah on Monday apologized for the “error of judgment,” which triggered the resignations of the BBC’s top executive and its head of news. Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing of a speech Trump delivered on Jan. 6, 2021, before a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington. The hourlong documentary — titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” — was broadcast as part of the BBC’s “Panorama” series days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Shah said the broadcaster accepted “that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.” Related Stories Syrian official says his country has joined the anti-IS coalition but not the military mission 2 MIN READ Europe has season finale in Dubai.

The BBC said it would review the letter “and respond directly in due course.” Top executives quit Trump had earlier welcomed the resignations of the two BBC executives. He posted a link to a Daily Telegraph story about the speech-editing on his Truth Social network, thanking the newspaper “for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” He called that “a terrible thing for Democracy!” In a resignation letter to staff, Davie said: “There have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility.” Turness said the controversy was damaging the BBC, and she quit “because the buck stops with me.” She defended the organization’s journalists against allegations of bias. “Our journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality, and I will stand by their journalism,” she said Monday. “There is no institutional bias. Mistakes are made, but there’s no institutional bias.” Trump speech edited Pressure on the broadcaster’s top executives has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The “Panorama” episode showed an edited clip from the January 2021 speech in which Trump claimed the 2020 presidential election had been rigged. Trump is shown saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” According to video and a transcript from Trump’s comments that day , he said:  “I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. “Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” Trump used the “fight like hell” phrase toward the end of the speech, but without referencing the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said. In a letter to Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Shah said the purpose of editing Trump’s words had been “to convey the message of the speech” so that viewers could understand how it had been received by Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground. He said the program had not attracted “significant audience feedback” when it first aired but had drawn more than 500 complaints since Prescott’s dossier was made public. Shah acknowledged in a BBC interview that “it would have been better to have acted earlier. But we didn’t.” A national institution The 103-year-old BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households who watch live TV or any BBC content. The broadcaster is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. It’s frequently a political football, with conservatives seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. It has also been criticized from all angles over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In February, the BBC removed a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of an official in the Hamas-led government. Governments of both left and right have long been accused of meddling with the broadcaster, which is overseen by a board that includes both BBC nominees and government appointees. Some defenders of the BBC allege that members of the board appointed under previous Conservative governments have been undermining the corporation from within. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman, Tom Wells, said the center-left Labour Party government supports “a strong, independent BBC” and doesn’t think the broadcaster is biased. “But it is important that the BBC acts to maintain trust and corrects mistakes quickly when they occur,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed from Washington."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/turkey-plane-azerbaijan-georgia-crash-military-cargo-bcc35b26c66287f55b73cc11139dd3b4","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:43:33+00:00","title":"Turkish Military Plane Crashes in Georgia Near Azerbaijani Border, 20 People On Board","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish military C-130 cargo plane, on a routine flight from Azerbaijan back to Turkey, crashed in the Sighnaghi municipality of Georgia near the Azerbaijani border on November 11, 2025.

The Georgian Interior Ministry said the aircraft crashed in Georgia’s Sighnaghi municipality, close to the Azerbaijani border, adding that an investigation has been launched. Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency quoted the Georgian aviation authority as saying that contact with the plane was lost a few minutes after it had entered Georgia’s airspace.

Most congressional Democrats were against the deal that eight of the senators, who caucus with them, crossed the aisle to vote and reopen the government. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the move a \"terrible mistake\"; Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it was indefensible; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, declared it a \"policy and political disaster.\" And there were far harsher things said about the deal on social media across the political spectrum of people left of center, not just the most progressive. Make no mistake: bridging the divide is going to be a significant challenge. But despite the intense blowback, the result in the end might not be all that bad for Democrats in next year's midterm elections. Consider that affordability was the dominant issue in the off-year elections, where  Democrats won sweeping victories . If it's the most important issue next year — and it very likely will be — then Democrats will likely retain the advantage. What's more, if Republicans do vote against health care subsidy extensions in December — when a promised vote is to take place as part of this shutdown deal — then the GOP will fully own the increased health care costs that come with it. Democrats could also look like the adults who took the high road, recognizing the very real pain that a lot of people were beginning to feel when President Trump and his administration were beginning to turn the screws on the most vulnerable. So, Democrats' biggest challenge heading into next year's midterms may be keeping progressives on their side — and fired up to vote — after what many of them are viewing as the latest show of weakness from a party, as they see it, defined by that weakness. A Democratic vise Democrats put themselves in a very difficult position from the very beginning of this fight. Any acute observer could have seen this coming — and realize Democrats had nothing but bad options. Republicans dug in, figuring at least enough Democrats couldn't handle the pain of millions losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits as well as federal worker furloughs and layoffs. And they were right. \"Most of us up here have voted repeatedly with the Democratic strategy,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"But after 40 days, it wasn't going to work.\" It's hard to \"win\" a fight when one side broadly cares about whether the government is open and working properly and the other thinks government is the problem. For Kaine and the seven others who crossed over to join most Republicans in voting to end the shutdown, a commitment to hold a vote to extend health care subsidies, combined with the protections for federal workers and SNAP benefits, was enough. \"I don't think much of anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,\" said Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who voted repeatedly to end the shutdown. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, is one of the three Democrats who has also been voting to end the shutdown, said bluntly: \"It wasn't working. It's been six weeks. Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\" \"Waiting another week, or another month, wouldn't deliver a better outcome,\" New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. \"It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country.\" Not everyone agrees with that reasoning, including swing-state Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan. \"I always said it's got to do something concrete on health care,\" she said of an agreement to reopen the government. \"And it's hard to see how that happened.\" Leadership problems Democratic leaders also were ostensibly against the deal to reopen the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no, though there are questions about whether Schumer allowed the senators, who went ahead with the votes, to do so. None of the senators who came out in favor of the shutdown deal are in imminent political jeopardy, given they're not facing reelection next year, and two of them are retiring. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Leader Schumer, are opposing this bill in the Senate,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday. He pointed out that the Trump administration's actions when it comes to federal workers leaves most Democrats \"deeply skeptical\" of their \"intentions.\" And on health care, Republicans, he noted, have not acted in \"good faith,\" given that it's the party that tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times. \"It doesn't change the core problem here,\" Jeffries said of the shutdown deal. \"We need to decisively address the Republican health care crisis on behalf of working-class Americans, everyday Americans and middle-class Americans.\" But Schumer already faced significant pushback when he abandoned the fight in March and voted to keep the government open. And given the party's movement toward ousting older leaders, the shutdown deal could spell trouble for the 74-year-old New Yorker as a party leader, even if he didn't vote for it. A changing party — from pragmatism to pugilism in the age of Trump Schumer is certainly not representative of how the Democratic Party is changing. And the moderates, who signed onto this deal, also very much represent the old guard of the party. For as much that's made of how much the GOP has changed since Trump came into office — and it has been a lot — the Democrats have changed as well. Democrats have moved from pragmatism to pugilism. As an example of that, in April of 2017, just after Trump began his first term, an  NBC poll found  that 6-in-10 Democrats favored making compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation. But that has completely flipped. As of March of this year, the last time there was a threat of a shutdown, two-thirds of Democrats said they think Democrats in Congress should instead stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington. Not every progressive sees what happened as a total disaster for the left. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, who is generally a pretty pragmatic progressive, sees a silver lining. He described the deal as \"embarrassing,\" but  sees progress for the left : “[T]here’s a difference between the deal itself and where the deal leaves Democrats and the broader anti-Trump opposition. This deal shows us that Democrats still don’t have the caucus they need for this fight that will be going on at least through this decade. But the shutdown also accomplished a lot. And not withstanding the WTF fumble at the 10-yard line, it’s still a dramatically different caucus than we had in March. … Democratic voters need to keep demanding more, keep up the pressure and keep purging the Senate caucus of senators who are not up to the new reality.” He also points out that if this deal goes through, there will be another funding deadline at the end of January. At that point, if Democrats don't extract health care extensions or anything else of consequence, there will be another opportunity for leverage. Over the next year, there will also likely be primaries from the left and expect the shutdown positioning to be a litmus test for those primaries — and for 2028. In the meantime, Democratic officials are banking on voters having a short-term memory, that with time, progressives will take a victory in the progress they've made in moving the party to a more fighting stance — and the issue landscape will propel them to winning next year. And winning cures a lot of divisions. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/equatorial-guinea-payment-marco-rubio-82335605d00326d59f9464d4e6c1c018","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:48:59Z","title":"Trump Administration Pays $7.5 Million to Equatorial Guinea Amid Deportation Efforts and Corruption Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration paid $7.5 million to Equatorial Guinea from a humanitarian migration fund, a move criticized by Senator Jeanne Shaheen as highly unusual and ethically troubling due to Equatorial Guinea's well-documented corruption and human rights abuses.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.” Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country. The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money. The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.” Related Stories Top diplomats from G7 countries meet in Canada as trade tensions rise with Trump 3 MIN READ How Trump’s support for a white minority group in South Africa led to a US boycott of the G20 summit 4 MIN READ The Latest: Bill to end government shutdown passes the Senate, heads to House next for final vote 20 MIN READ As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust. The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption. At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang , who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries . The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang . Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there. Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He’s accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty. Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang’s father, is Africa’s longest-serving president , holding power since 1979. In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice. U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-fungwong-philippines-kalmaegi-evacuations-taiwan-027a3a79f6f99d46b373b8712e2b2087","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"01:30:09+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong Leaves at Least 18 Dead in the Philippines as It Moves Toward Taiwan","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, a super typhoon with sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph), made landfall in northeastern Aurora province of the Philippines on Sunday, November 9, 2025, causing flash floods, landslides, and at least 18 deaths across several provinces including Nueva Vizcaya and Kalinga.

The justices, without comment, turned away an appeal from Kim Davis , the former Kentucky court clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the high court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Davis had been trying to get the court to overturn a lower-court order for her to pay $360,000 in damages and attorney’s fees to a couple denied a marriage license. The Supreme Court has rejected a call to overturn its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Here’s what to know. Her lawyers repeatedly invoked the words of Justice Clarence Thomas, who alone among the nine justices has called for erasing the same-sex marriage ruling. Thomas was among four dissenting justices in 2015. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are the other dissenters who are on the court today. Roberts has been silent on the subject since he wrote a dissenting opinion in the case. Alito has continued to criticize the decision, but he said recently he was not advocating that it be overturned. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was not on the court in 2015, has said that there are times when the court should correct mistakes and overturn decisions, as it did in the 2022 case that ended a constitutional right to abortion .

She defied court orders to issue the licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court in September 2015. She was released after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The Kentucky legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.

2025-11-10T05:07:28+00:00\n\nBELEM, Brazil (AP) — A litany of recent weather disasters rang long Monday at the opening of U.N. climate negotiations : Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica, a deadly tornado in Brazil , droughts and fire in Africa. Against that backdrop, activists used an empty chair to drive home the absence from these talks of the United States, the world’s richest nation and second-biggest carbon polluter. World leaders highlighted the devastation wrought on some of the world’s poorest places to show the need to work collectively to fight global warming , which is fueling extreme weather. But any united front will be without the U.S., one of only four nations missing the talks, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar. The 195 nations who did come to Belem, a weathered city on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, for the talks known as COP30 were told that only together can they swiftly reduce the emissions from coal, oil and gas that cause climate change. While the activists’ empty chair primarily illustrated the U.S. absence, it was also intended to be a call-out for other nations “to step in and step up,” Danni Taaffe with Climate Action Network International told The Associated Press.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More A clear mandate Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , whose nation is hosting these talks, urged negotiators not to forget that “the climate emergency is an increase of inequality.” “It deepens the perverse logic that defines who is worthy of living and who should die,” Lula said. This year’s talks are not expected to produce an ambitious new deal. Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year’s conference as the “implementation COP.” Countries had a clear mandate: arrive with their updated national plans to fight climate change. On Monday, the United Nations released updated calculations showing that those national pledges promise to reduce projected 2035 global greenhouse gas emissions 12% below 2019 levels. That’s 2 points better than last month, before new pledges rolled in. Attendees on Monday stressed cooperation, with Stiell saying that individual nations simply cannot cut heat-trapping gas emissions fast enough on their own. André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasized that negotiators must engage in “mutirão” — a local Indigenous term that refers to a group uniting to complete a task. A united front — without the US Complicating those calls is the absence of the United States, where U.S. President Donald Trump has long denied the existence of climate change. The U.N.'s updated figures Monday depend on a U.S. pledge that came from the Biden administration in December — before Trump returned to the White House and began working to boost fossil fuels and block clean energy like wind and solar. His administration did not send high-level negotiators to Belem, and he began his second term by withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement , the first global pact to fight climate change. The Paris Agreement sought to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the historical average, but many scientists now say it’s unlikely countries will stay below that threshold. The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S. Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States, said the U.S. withdrawal “has really shifted the gravity’’ of the negotiating system. Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said. “It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said. Though the U.S. government isn’t showing up, some attendees including former top U.S. negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will help take up the slack.

rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America. The loss of the country’s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading. Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely. Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel. Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it’s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30. It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.

It’s a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it’s an embarrassing development,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. “No country with the amount of resources of Canada — or other countries in North America even — should lose their measles elimination status.” Vaccination campaigns led to elimination Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns , the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023. But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada’s loss. Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada’s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year. It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday. “As a region, we have eliminated measles twice,” Barbosa said. “We can do it a third time.” In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance. The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses. Barbosa’s organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks. In 2024, the region had a 79% vaccination rate, an increase from years past but still too low, he said. United States could be next to lose status The U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. That status is at risk even though the large outbreak that killed three and sickened nearly 900 across Texas , New Mexico and Oklahoma earlier this year is over. Current outbreaks in the U.S. include 34 cases in South Carolina and one hitting towns on the Arizona-Utah border that has sickened more than 150 since mid-August. A major question now is if either are linked to the Texas outbreak. To lose elimination status, health data must show a continuous chain of measles spread for one year. International health officials have recommended the U.S. “enhance case investigation protocols,” because closing data gaps is key to stopping the virus from taking hold again, said Dr. Daniel Salas, who leads immunization efforts at the Pan American Health Organization. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,681 cases and 44 outbreaks this year, making it the worst year for measles in the U.S. in more than three decades. Only nine states haven’t confirmed cases, according to the CDC. A large outbreak also continues in Chihuahua, Mexico, where health officials have confirmed 4,430 cases as of last week and 21 deaths, according to state health data. Mexican and U.S. officials have said the genetic strains of measles spreading in Canada match those in the Texas and Chihuahua outbreaks. All those outbreaks affected certain Mennonite Christian communities who trace their migration over generations from Canada to Mexico to Seminole, Texas . In August, officials said Mennonite communities in Belize, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay had outbreaks of the same type of measles virus. Mennonite churches do not formally discourage vaccination, though more conservative Mennonite communities historically have low vaccination rates and a distrust of government. It’s tempting to look at the outbreaks in a vacuum, Nuzzo said. But many are likely linked, she said, not just by sick people traveling but also by anti-vaccine disinformation. “It’s not a religious prohibition in most of these cases,” she said. “It is just people being, perhaps, distrustful of authorities, but also preyed upon by these anti-vaccine influencers who profit off of the fears that some people may have.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

running a darknet platform that called for prominent politicians to be murdered, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe suspect, a German-Polish dual citizen identified only as “Martin S.” in line with German privacy rules, was detained in the western city of Dortmund late on Monday, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement. Public broadcaster ARD reported that he had ties to the far-right Reich Citizens movement, citing security sources.\n\nHe is suspected of “terrorism” financing, providing instructions for committing serious acts of violence endangering the state and dangerous dissemination of personal data.\n\nProsecutors allege that Martin S. had been calling for attacks on politicians, officials and other figures in German public life on the darknet – the name given to parts of the internet that can only be accessed using specialised software – since at least June. He is accused of anonymously running a platform on which he published lists of names, self-styled death sentences and instructions for building explosives.\n\nProsecutors did not address his motive or suggest he was working for a foreign actor.\n\nMartin S. also allegedly called for donations in cryptocurrency that were intended to be offered as a reward for killing his targets. The platform contained sensitive personal data on potential victims, prosecutors said.\n\nWhile authorities did not name any of the politicians or public figures Martin S. had targeted, Spiegel news magazine reported that former chancellors Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz, as well as other former federal ministers, were on the list.\n\nGerman politicians complain that they are increasingly subject to attacks, both verbal and physical, at a time of deepening polarisation.\n\nThere has also been a general increase in the scale of cyber threats to Germany and other Western countries.\n\nInterior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, asked about the case at a previously scheduled news conference, said the investigation into a suspect trying to generate money to finance attacks against public figures via “a right-wing extremist platform” had been ongoing since June. He declined to give further details.\n\nFederal prosecutors are responsible for significant extremism-related and national security cases in Germany.\n\nProsecutors said in a statement on Tuesday that “the accused will appear before an investigative judge today, who will decide whether to issue an arrest warrant”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1111-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00+00:00","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global events including the release of a film exposing alleged systematic abuse by Israeli soldiers in Gaza, Canada's loss of measles elimination status due to a resurgence of the disease, the growing difficulty in identifying Palestinian remains during conflict, political repression in a country where opposition leader Tundu Lissu remains imprisoned, a footballer hinting at retirement after the World Cup, legal and economic challenges to Trump’s tariff plan, allegations of false flag operations involving Russian warplane pilots, a fast-food chain’s expansion into China via a private equity partnership, and a controversial legislative amendment that centralizes executive and military power—raising concerns about democratic oversight.

It wasn’t until several weeks into his campaign for a key U.S. Senate seat that Platner says he discovered that the design was recognized as a Nazi symbol. Rather than wait through multiple sessions of laser removal, Platner called a friend to help him get rid of it.

I found out it’s something I don’t want, can you help me cover it up?’” Mischa Ostberg, an artist based in Ellsworth, Maine, told The Associated Press in an interview. Ostberg, a self-proclaimed “baby tattooer” who has been licensed to ink for just two years, was eager to help. For Ostberg, the request wasn’t abnormal — covering up a design is a common practice in the tattoo world — and Platner’s willingness to take action when learning about the image’s connection to Nazis was reflective of the friend Ostberg had known for years.

Court and Congress to decide when full payments will resume under the SNAP food aid program that helps 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries, as some wonder how they will feed their families without government assistance. The Supreme Court is expected to rule Tuesday on a request from President Donald Trump’s administration to keep blocking states from providing full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, arguing the money might be needed elsewhere. The seesawing rulings mean that beneficiaries in some states, including Hawaii and New Jersey, have received their full monthly allocations while in others, such as Nebraska and West Virginia, they have received nothing. The legal wrangling could be moot if the U.S. House adopts and Trump signs legislation to quickly end the federal government shutdown . It’s not clear how quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens or the Supreme Court orders full payments. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on An urgent need for beneficiaries The cascading legal rulings — plus the varying responses of each state to the shutoff — means people who rely on SNAP are in vastly different situations. Some have all their benefits, some have none. In states including North Carolina and Texas, beneficiaries have received partial amounts. In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday. Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year. That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what’s left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen. “It’s kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.” The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help . “I figure that I’ve spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,” said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a “little food pantry” in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York. SNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for some 42 million Americans. The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order. An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume , and that requirement is set to kick in Tuesday night unless the top court takes action again. Congressional talks about reopening government The U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans. Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it “looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.” Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn’t be up to the courts. “The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. “The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.” The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion. “The chaos was sown by USDA’s delays and intransigence,” they said, “not by the district court’s efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.” ___ Associated Press reporter Cara Anna in Carthage, New York, contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-8-democrats-e83180c0b69642a00a234c244d9ea76e","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:46:21+00:00","title":"Eight Democratic Senators Break Ranks to End Government Shutdown Amid Criticism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a prolonged government shutdown, eight Democratic senators defied party leadership and voted to reopen the government, citing the severe human and economic toll, including mass layoffs, halted air travel, and food insecurity.

(AP) — The senators — eight in total — faced almost instant blowback from Democrats as they broke ranks and voted to allow the Senate to move forward on compromise legislation that would reopen the government. Their decision Sunday night was labeled a “betrayal” and “pathetic” by some of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party. “To my mind, this was a very, very bad vote,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. The group of defectors consisted of several senators who are retiring next year, as well as a number of former governors. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana praised them Monday morning, saying they “decided to put principle over their personal politics.” The senators surely knew the criticism that was coming. But after huddling for hours — often in the Senate basement — over the last week, each senator reached the same conclusion: It was time for the government shutdown to end. Sen.

What questions do you have for them? Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire Shaheen, a senior Democrat who will be retiring from the Senate, often took the lead in negotiating the compromise legislation to end the shutdown. She had made it a priority to extend subsidies for health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act , but she had also expressed reservations about voting to shut down the government. In the end, she settled for a pledge from Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota to hold a vote in December on the health subsidies. “This was the only deal on the table. It was our best chance to reopen the government and immediately begin negotiations to extend the ACA tax credits that tens of millions of Americans rely on to keep costs down,” she said at a news conference following the Sunday night vote.

Durbin holds the No. 2 position in Democratic leadership and broke ranks with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York after saying that the shutdown had caused too much pain for the American people. In a statement before the vote, Durbin, who argued that Republicans are still to blame for the shutdown, said, “This bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt. Not only would it fully fund SNAP for the year ahead, but it would reverse the mass firings the Trump Administration ordered throughout the shutdown.” Sen.

Tim Kaine of Virginia Kaine, a former Virginia governor, was one of the last Democrats to join the group willing to vote to advance to the bill. He said that, as late as Sunday evening, he was checking over the legislation with his staff. For him, the deciding factor was language in the funding bill that prevents President Donald Trump’s administration from conducting more mass layoffs — an issue that is particularly important for his state. He called the agreement a “moratorium on mischief” and said he was only able to get the agreement as negotiations reached a crucial juncture. “The kinds of just non-strategic mass firings and (reduction in force actions) that have traumatized federal employees since Inauguration Day, they can’t do them anymore,” Kaine said.

He has consistently said that he is opposed to using a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic, yet he also wanted Congress to extend the health care subsidies. After Republicans rejected a proposal from Schumer to extend the ACA tax credits for one year, King said it showed that the shutdown was not working. “The question was: Does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits? Our judgment was that it would not produce that result,” King said. Sen.

conflict have displaced millions of people across the globe, the United Nations has warned before the opening of its annual climate change conference.\n\nThe UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a report, published on Monday to coincide with the launch of the 30th annual UN Climate Change conference (COP) in Brazil, that weather-related disasters caused about 250 million people to flee their homes over the past decade.\n\nThe migration agency issued its second major report on the effect of climate change on refugees – No Escape II: The Way Forward – in the run-up to COP 30, as it appears that the enthusiasm of countries to agree action to curb climate change continues to ebb.\n\n“Over the past decade, weather-related disasters have caused some 250 million internal displacements – equivalent to over 67,000 displacements per day,” the report said .\n\nThe UNHCR added that climate change is also increasing the difficulties faced by those displaced by conflict and other driving forces.\n\n“Climate change is compounding and multiplying the challenges faced by those who have already been displaced, as well as their hosts, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings,” it continued.\n\nFloods in South Sudan and Brazil, record heat in Kenya and Pakistan, and water shortages in Chad and Ethiopia are among the disasters noted in the report.\n\nThe number of countries facing extreme exposure to climate-related hazards is projected to rise from three to 65 by 2040.\n\nThose 65 countries host more than 45 percent of all people currently displaced by conflict, it added.\n\n“Extreme weather is … destroying homes and livelihoods, and forcing families – many who have already fled violence – to flee once more,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement.\n\n“These are people who have already endured immense loss, and now they face the same hardships and devastation again. They are among the hardest hit by severe droughts, deadly floods and record-breaking heatwaves, yet they have the fewest resources to recover,” he said.\n\nBy 2050, the report reads, the hottest 15 refugee camps in the world – in The Gambia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Senegal and Mali – are projected to experience nearly 200 days of hazardous heat stress per year.\n\nThe refugee agency’s report emphasised that while the effect of climate change is growing, the commitment towards dealing with it has been weakening.\n\nThe UNHCR hopes to reawaken efforts to fight the effects at the conference in Brazil.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States, traditionally the world’s top donor, has  slashed foreign aid .\n\nWashington previously accounted for more than 40 percent of the UNHCR’s budget. Other major donor countries have also been tightening their belts.\n\n“Funding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather,” Grandi said.\n\n“To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge,” he said. “This COP must deliver real action, not empty promises.”\n\nAbout 50,000 participants from more than 190 countries will meet in Belem, in the Amazon rainforest, to discuss curbing the climate crisis.\n\nOne topic on the agenda exposing the difficulties of agreeing on global action is the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\nThe policy is designed to prevent “carbon leakage” by requiring importers of carbon-intensive goods like steel and cement to pay the same price for embedded emissions that EU producers face domestically.\n\nWhile the EU promotes CBAM as a necessary environmental tool to encourage greener practices, critics of the policy, including major trading partners like the US and China, view it as a veiled act of protectionism.\n\nDeveloping nations, meanwhile, are concerned that it unfairly shifts the financial burden of climate action onto them."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine prior to cancer immunotherapy is associated with significantly improved survival, especially in patients with advanced lung cancer and metastatic melanoma. The study, based on data from over 1,000 patients treated between 2019 and 2023, found that vaccinated patients lived nearly twice as long as those who did not receive the vaccine. The effect was most notable in 'cold' tumors—those previously resistant to immune attack—where the vaccine appears to 'wake up' the immune system, enhancing dendritic cell activity and T-cell response. While not creating new tumor-killing T cells, the vaccine may improve tumor detection and immune activation. The findings, presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and published in Nature, suggest that mRNA vaccines could be repurposed as a universal, off-the-shelf tool to enhance cancer treatment, especially when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/russia-says-ukrainian-british-plot-to-hijack-hypersonic-missile-foiled","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:29:35+00:00","title":"Russia says Ukrainian-British plot to hijack hypersonic missile foiled","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia claims that a Ukrainian-British intelligence plot was foiled in which a pilot was allegedly offered $3 million to hijack a MiG-31 fighter jet equipped with a hypersonic Kinzhal missile and fly it to Constanta, Romania, to trigger a false flag attack on a major NATO airbase.

detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate summit, hosted in Belem, Brazil, marks a pivotal moment in global climate negotiations with a focus on implementation rather than new targets.

(COP30) begins on Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. About 50,000 people from more than 190 countries, including diplomats and climate experts, are expected to attend the 11-day meeting in the Amazon.\n\nDelegates are expected to discuss the climate crisis and its devastating impacts, including the rising frequency of extreme weather.\n\nThe hosts have a packed agenda with 145 meetings planned to discuss the green fuel transition and global warming as well as the failure to implement past promises.\n\nAndre Correa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasised that negotiators engage in “mutirao”, a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.\n\n“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators on Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/us-senate-votes-to-end-shutdown-why-democrats-are-upset-with-chuck-schumer","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:20:20+00:00","title":"US Senate votes to end shutdown: Why Democrats are upset with Chuck Schumer","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a decisive vote, the U.S. Senate ended a 40-day government shutdown by approving a Republican-led deal that funds parts of the government until January 30, 2025, but excludes vital healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which benefits 24 million Americans.

Senate votes to end shutdown: Why Democrats are upset with Chuck Schumer\n\nDemocratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer is facing mounting calls to step aside after seven Democrats broke ranks with the party to vote for a Republican-led proposal to end the government shutdown without receiving concessions.\n\nThe deal does not resolve extending healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was one of the main demands from the Democrats.\n\nThe progressive section of the Democratic Party has blamed Schumer for the passing of the bill in the Senate on Monday, ending the longest shutdown in the country’s history.\n\n“He’s the leader of the Senate. This deal would never have happened if he had not blessed it. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of other senators who are saying that they kept Senator Schumer in the loop the whole time,” Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told CBS News.\n\nThe measure approved by the Senate would fund parts of the government until January 30, but excludes ACA health insurance subsidies that benefit some 24 million Americans.\n\nThe Senate Republicans, however, have agreed to hold another vote in December to decide on the healthcare subsidies. But it is not guaranteed that the healthcare subsidies will be approved.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans hold 53 seats and Democrats have 47, but Republicans do not have the 60 votes needed to advance bills. Eight senators who caucus with the Democrats voted to move the Republican measure forward.\n\nDemocratic senators who voted for the motion to advance the bill included Dick Durbin of Illinois; Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire; John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada; and Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nIndependent Senator Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted in favour of the measure.\n\nSchumer, 74, did not vote in favour of the measure on Monday, but he is being accused by the party leaders of allowing the centrist Democrats to strike a deal with the Senate Republicans.\n\nIn his Senate speech on Monday, Schumer raised the issue of healthcare, saying, “The American people will not forget Donald Trump’s cruelty and heartlessness over the past six weeks,” Schumer said.\n\nBut progressive Democrats have not absolved him for failing to stop the defections.\n\n“Leadership is about changing and adapting when there is real need, and unless we hear that, we will fail to meet the moment,” Democratic Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin said in a statement.\n\nRepresentative Khanna wrote on X on Monday, “Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced.”\n\nIn another interview with an online US politics show, Khanna slammed Schumer for his stance on Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, as well as his support for the 2003 Iraq war.\n\n“You’ve had Schumer cheerleading the Iraq War, cheerleading a blank cheque to [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, betraying us on the first shutdown … and now he’s not even willing to fight!” he told the Breaking Points.\n\nKhanna added that Schumer should be “replaced” and the only reason more Democrats are not calling for it is that it would “offend a lot of donors”.\n\n“Are we gonna be beholden to the donors that have gotten us two terms of Donald Trump, or are we gonna listen to people?” he asked.\n\nWhile Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) of New York did not explicitly call out Schumer, she wrote in an X post on Monday: “The average ACA benefit is up to $550 a person/mo. People want us to hold the line for a reason. This is not a matter of appealing to a base. It’s about people’s lives. Working people want leaders whose word means something.”\n\nCongresswoman Rashida Tlaib said that “the Democratic Party needs leaders who fight and deliver for working people. Schumer should step down.”\n\n“After 40 days of holding firm, with public opinion and momentum on our side, establishment Democrats decided to cave to Trump,” left-wing activist Saikat Chakrabarti, who is running for Congress to represent San Francisco, said. “Schumer and the entire democratic leadership need to step down — and if they run for re-election, we need to primary them.”\n\nThe Senate vote came days after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the  New York mayoral election  on the Democratic Party ticket. Mamdani was not endorsed by a number of Democrats, including Schumer.\n\nBut House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries defended Schumer. “Leader Schumer and Senate Democrats over the last seven weeks have waged a valiant fight on behalf of the American people,” he said on Monday.\n\nSince the beginning of the shutdown, Democratic senators voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they demanded the extension of the ACA tax credits.\n\nSchumer also faced the ire of party leaders when he backed a deal to avert a shutdown in March without getting concessions on healthcare subsidies.\n\nCongresswoman AOC, a member of the progressive wing of the party, had called the vote a “tremendous mistake”. “I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,” she had told reporters.\n\nWhile Democrats saw success in the recent local elections, emerging rifts now highlight a widening gap between the establishment Democrats and progressive and left-wing Democrats.\n\nSchumer can be removed from his position as the Senate minority leader in internal Democratic leadership elections, which would be held after the November 2026 Senate elections. The 45 Democratic senators and two independents who caucus with Democrats get to vote on this.\n\nEven if Schumer is removed as the Democratic leader in the Senate, his seat as a senator is secure until 2028."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/inside-the-year-long-bbc-saga-that-led-to-trumps-1bn-lawsuit-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:09:31+00:00","title":"Inside the year-long BBC saga that led to Trump’s $1bn lawsuit threat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A year-long controversy involving the BBC and former US President Donald Trump centers on allegations of misleading edits in a 2021 Panorama documentary that misrepresented Trump’s speech before the January 6 Capitol riot.

Speaking to Radio 4’s flagship Today news programme on Monday, David Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, said Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper cited a “BBC insider” who said that board member Robbie Gibb, who is a personal friend of Prescott, had “led the charge”.\n\nGibb also served as director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May and was an editorial adviser at the right-leaning GB News, before being appointed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the BBC board in 2021. Gibb also sits on the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) along with BBC chair and committee head Samir Shah, Tim Davie and independent director Caroline Thomson.\n\nThe BBC, responding to queries from the Guardian, said Gibb was only one of the four board members who approved Prescott as a consultant to EGSC. Prescott, in his memo, said he had no political affiliations.\n\nThis is a timeline of events leading up to the Trump Panorama documentary scandal this week.\n\nSome of the dates highlighted here are taken from a letter sent by chair Samir Shah to parliament on Monday, and from the memo sent by Michael Prescott to BBC board members.\n\nAn hour-long BBC Panorama documentary titled, Trump: A Second Chance? was broadcast one week before the US presidential elections.\n\nIn it, two separate parts of a speech made by Trump before the Capitol Hill riots in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, were spliced together by editors.\n\nThis editing gave the impression that Trump had actively encouraged the riots, which turned violent. The edited clip showed Trump saying, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nHowever, transcripts from Trump’s speech show that he first said, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nThen, nearly an entire hour later, he said, “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He was not directly referencing the march on the Capitol in the second part, and the Panorama documentary did not include a part where Trump said he wanted supporters to “peacefully” make their voices heard.\n\nConcerns about the editing of the Trump speech were raised at a meeting of the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board (EGSB). However, this was raised as part of general reflections on coverage of the elections, according to Samir Shah.\n\nPrescott raised concerns, Shah said, but the committee also heard from the news department, which said it was edited to “better convey the message of the speech”. Feedback was sent to the Panorama team, but no formal action was taken, Shah said.\n\nPrescott later wrote in his memo that EGSC consultant David Grossman also delivered a report during the meeting showing the BBC had been biased in its coverage of Trump, and appeared to favour Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nIn February, the UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through  Israel’s war on Gaza  had broken rules on impartiality as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, from its online streaming platform.\n\nAccording to Prescott’s memo, a senior member of the news team again defended the Panorama editing, saying, “There was no attempt to mislead the audience about the content or nature of Mr Trump’s speech before the riot at the Capitol. It’s normal practice to edit speeches into short form clips.”\n\nPrescott added that Turness also justified the editing at this meeting.\n\nIn his memo, Prescott said he emailed Samir Shah the following day to explain his concerns, saying, “This is a very, very dangerous precedent. I hope you agree and take some form of action to ensure this potentially huge problem is nipped in the bud.”\n\nPrescott said he received no reply.\n\nThis was undertaken by Chris Saul, a legal consultant who has been tasked with previous reviews of the transparency of BBC processes since  2019. The specific issues he was asked to report on for this review, and the outcomes, are unclear.\n\nAt some point after this, Prescott sent his detailed memo to all board members along with a cover letter stating his “despair” at being ignored by senior news leaders.\n\nThe memo accused the BBC of “misleading” edits, and claimed the BBC Arabic service had shown anti-Israel bias by over-emphasising stories critical of Israel. Prescott’s memo said BBC coverage was “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza, and also wrongly presented coverage on starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nAt one point, Prescott appeared to take a swipe at Al Jazeera: When a senior news member defended BBC Arabic in meetings, saying it was almost as trusted as Al Jazeera, Prescott questioned if Al Jazeera “is the gold standard” the BBC should aspire to.\n\nThe memo further criticised what he called the BBC’s “one-sided” trans rights coverage, claiming stories highlighting women’s rights organisations and others who were critical of the trans rights movement had been suppressed.\n\nIn July, an internal BBC investigation found that the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which was removed from its website in February, had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nMore than 100 journalists working for the BBC wrote a letter protesting this and claimed they were being forced to “do Israel’s PR”.\n\n“We believe the refusal to broadcast the documentary ‘Gaza: Medics Under Fire’ is just one in a long line of agenda driven decisions,” the journalists wrote. “It demonstrates, once again, that the BBC is not reporting ‘without fear or favour’ when it comes to Israel.”\n\nShah said he met Prescott afterwards to discuss “next steps”.\n\nThis was the first time the contents of the memo entered the public domain. The right-wing broadsheet newspaper accused the BBC of doctoring the Trump speech and reported that Prescott had revealed “systemic problems” which BBC management had failed to address.\n\nParliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, led by Conservative chair Caroline Dinenage, wrote to Samir Shah requesting access to Prescott’s full report, and demanding to know what actions had been taken by the BBC in response to the memo when it was first sent.\n\nDinenage also requested an update about the EGSC review, which began in June. “The BBC clearly has serious questions to answer regarding both its editorial standards and the way in which concerns are handled by senior management,” Dinenage wrote  in the letter.\n\nShe added that members of parliament “need to be reassured that those at the very top of the BBC are treating these issues with the seriousness they deserve”.\n\nIn a statement, a BBC spokesperson said, “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback, it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.”\n\nAccording to reporting by the Guardian newspaper, Gibb was present at this meeting and was one of the board members who pressed CEO Turness over Prescott’s claims. Gibb had also pressed Turness on the memo in an earlier board meeting, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe parliamentary website announced that Michael Prescott would give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Wednesday, November 12 at 10am, as the UK government prepared to launch a review of the BBC generally in advance renewal of its Royal Charter, which sets the terms for its operations, and which is due in 2027. In a later update, the session was postponed to an as-yet-undisclosed date.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised the BBC in an interview with The Daily Telegraph following the leak. Leavitt said watching the BBC on her trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that the BBC is “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nIn a column in the right-wing Daily Mail newspaper, Johnson accused Director-General Tim Davie of failing to provide any explanations about the issue of impartiality at the BBC following the leak.\n\n“No one has even come close to resigning,” he wrote.\n\nJohnson accused the BBC of being a “sort of mouthpiece for Hamas”, and added that until Davie responded to the memo, “I am simply going to stop paying my licence fee and suggest you do the same.”\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie said “ultimate responsibility” lay with him, and that he had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nChief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness said the “buck stops with me”. She added that “while mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong”.\n\nTrump reacted triumphantly to the news of the resignations on his Truth Social network.\n\nHe wrote: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt “Journalists.” These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\nThe BBC chair and head of the EGSC, Shah responded to Parliament’s letter of November 4.\n\nShah said many of the issues Prescott raised were already under review.\n\nHe pushed back against claims by Prescott that management had not acted on the points raised regarding the Trump documentary.\n\nShah wrote, “There was concern expressed by members of the Committee as well as Mr Prescott of the way programme was edited. However, the EGSC also heard from BBC News that the purpose of editing the clip was to convey the message of the speech made by President Trump so that Panorama’s audience could better understand how it had been received by President Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time.”\n\nHe said he met with Prescott after an October 17 board meeting to discuss the issues and next steps.\n\nShah apologised for the BBC’s “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech, but said there was no institutional bias at the BBC.\n\nHe also laid out steps being taken to review the issues Prescott had raised and to overhaul the EGSC more generally.\n\nUS President Donald Trump threatened a $1bn lawsuit via a letter  to the BBC from his counsel, Alejandro Brito, alleging “malicious, disparaging” edits.\n\nThe letter demanded a retraction of the documentary, an apology, and payments to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused”.\n\nThe broadcaster has been given until Friday 22:00 GMT to respond or, Trump’s lawyer said, he will be: “left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 in damages. The BBC is on notice. PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY”.\n\nOutgoing Director-General Davie and BBC chair Samir Shah spoke to staff for 40 minutes. Davie admitted a “mistake” in the Panorama documentary and said that pressure following criticism of the film had contributed to his decision to resign. However, he also sounded a defiant note, and told staff, “I think we’ve got to fight for our journalism.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/how-would-pakistans-27th-amendment-reshape-its-military-and-courts","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:57:13+00:00","title":"How would Pakistan’s 27th Amendment reshape its military and courts?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan’s Senate has approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which would grant lifetime criminal immunity to five-star military officers, including Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, and create a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) office to unify military command.

Senate on Monday approved a constitutional amendment that aims to bring sweeping changes to the country’s judicial system and to the military’s command structure amid criticism that it seeks to weaken oversight over the government and leaders of the nation’s powerful army.\n\nThe proposed 27th Amendment eventually sailed through the Senate in a raucous evening sitting after the opposition boycotted the session.\n\nLike in the Senate, the amendment now needs to secure a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, which is expected to vote on the draft on Tuesday afternoon. If it gets those votes, the amendment would need President Asif Ali Zardari’s signature to become law.\n\nBut both the contents of the proposed amendment and the manner in which the Pakistani government has sought to push it through have sparked criticism, including from senior sitting judges, even as other experts said the changes are justified.\n\nThe 27th Amendment of the constitution, if it becomes law, would in effect grant immunity from criminal prosecution to the top-most military leaders while also reshaping the military’s command structure. These would be through changes to Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution.\n\nSeparate provisions in the amendment aim to set up a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), among other legal reforms.\n\nBut while many constitutional amendments are controversial, critics have questioned the rush with which the current amendment has been moved. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar presented it in the Senate on Saturday, the same day that the cabinet approved it.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif – who was in Baku, Azerbaijan, on a state visit along with army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir – attended the cabinet meeting virtually before his return to Islamabad on Sunday.\n\nAfter consultations within the government and with its allies, a revised draft was circulated in the Senate on Monday and passed the same evening. By contrast, the  26th Amendment , while also criticised by the opposition, followed months of public debate.\n\nSo what is the 27th Amendment all about? What makes it so controversial? And how are its defenders justifying it?\n\nArticle 243 defines the relationship between Pakistan’s civilian government and the military.\n\nThe revision amends Article 243 to create a new post of chief of defence forces (CDF), to be held by the army chief. This essentially gives the army chief authority also over the air force and the navy. If the amendment is passed, the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) would be abolished later this month.\n\nThe CJCSC is currently held by four-star General Sahir Shamshad, who is due to retire on November 27.\n\nSince independence in 1947, Pakistan’s military, especially the army, has been the  most powerful institution  in national life. Four coups and decades of direct and indirect military rule have entrenched that influence, and the army chief has long been the country’s most powerful figure.\n\nIts current holder, Munir, became army chief in November 2022 and was  promoted to five-star rank  on May 20, just 10 days after the country ended its  four-day conflict  with India.\n\nThe 27th Amendment would also grant five-star officers lifetime immunity while allowing them to “retain rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”.\n\nMunir is only the second Pakistani military officer, after Field Marshal Ayub Khan in the 1960s, to have received the five-star designation. None of the other military branches, such as the air force or navy, has had a five-star official.\n\nThe proposed amendment also creates the post of commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), responsible, among other things, for the country’s nuclear command. The head of the NSC would be appointed only from the army in consultation with the army chief/CDF.\n\nAccording to the Pakistani Constitution at present, Article 248 stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office.” But once out of office, they enjoy no such privileges.\n\nMilitary generals currently have no such immunity. Before the 27th Amendment, the title of field marshal was considered purely honorific with no additional powers or privileges. However, the proposed changes would essentially codify the ranking as a recognised constitutional position.\n\nIf the amendment passes, it would take a two-thirds majority in parliament to remove a five-star-ranked official – even though an elected government, by contrast, loses power when a simple majority in parliament votes against it. And a five-star officer would enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution for life.\n\n“Democracy does not survive where impunity is made a constitutional right,” Rida Hosain, a Lahore-based constitutional lawyer, told Al Jazeera. “It grants a nonelected army officer protections and powers that no democratically elected leader in the country has.”\n\nThe draft amendment seeks to create a permanent Federal Constitutional Court.\n\nThe FCC would be headed by its own chief justice and staffed by an equal number of judges from each of Pakistan’s four provinces as well as from Islamabad. It would adjudicate in disputes between governments, either the federal government and a state government or when different state governments clash.\n\nJudges of the FCC would retire at 68, unlike Supreme Court judges, who retire at 65. The FCC chief justice’s tenure would be capped at three years.\n\nThe draft also gives the president power to transfer a judge from one high court to another on the proposal of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the body responsible for recommending appointments to Pakistan’s superior judiciary.\n\nAfter the 26th Amendment was passed last year, the transfer of judges was to happen from one high court to another high court only through a presidential order.\n\nHowever, the judge’s consent was necessary for a transfer as were consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan and the two chief justices of respective high courts.\n\nThat would change under the new revision: The president would be able to transfer a judge on the recommendation of the JCP without the consent of the concerned judge.\n\nAdditionally, if a judge refuses his transfer, he would be given an opportunity to present his reasons before the JCP, and if the body finds the reasons invalid, the judge would have to retire.\n\nHosain said the amendment would mean judges can be transferred to other jurisdictions without their consent while refusal could lead to proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council, the body which holds judges accountable.\n\n“The fact that refusal leads to accountability proceedings being initiated is a veiled threat that weaponises administrative power to enforce compliance. It transforms an independent judicial office into one overshadowed by the constant fear of punitive or retaliatory transfer,” she added.\n\nReema Omer, legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), a Geneva-based nongovernmental organisation of judges and lawyers, said the new amendment has concerning implications, particularly in the short and medium term.\n\n“The executive will appoint the judges who will have the sole jurisdiction to hold the executive accountable,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It appears this is being done to shield the existing set-up from judicial scrutiny and accountability. Also, if and when required, the FCC can be used to give constitutional cover and legitimacy to these decisions of this set-up,” Omer added.\n\nSenior sitting judges have criticised the amendment too.\n\nMansoor Ali Shah, the second most senior judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP), wrote in an open letter to Chief Justice Yahya Afridi on Monday stating that the FCC does not represent a “genuine reform agenda” but is instead a “political device to weaken and control the judiciary”.\n\nCalling it a “manipulation of [the] judicial process”, Shah said such a court cannot be independent.\n\n“History does not easily forgive such abdications of duty; it records them as constitutional failures of leadership and moments when silence within institutions weakened the very edifice they were meant to guard,” he wrote.\n\nThe government’s rationale for bringing the changes to the constitution was presented in the draft of the amendment, in which it said the proposal stems from the increasing number of constitutional petitions being filed before the Supreme Court, which has “significantly impacted the timely disposal of regular civil and criminal cases”.\n\nChanges to Article 243, the government has said, were proposed to improve the “procedural clarity and administrative structure relating to the armed forces”.\n\nSome experts agreed.\n\nHafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, an advocate of the Supreme Court, said a permanent FCC would provide “focused expertise and timely adjudication”.\n\n“It is empowered to interpret the constitution, resolve federal-provincial disputes, determine the validity of laws and render advisory opinions. This ensures focused expertise and timely adjudication,” the Islamabad-based lawyer told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile the creation of the FCC will bring coherence, speed and discipline to constitutional adjudication, the introduction of the CDF office would unify strategic command and enhance coordination without disturbing the existing services’ autonomy, Khokhar argued.\n\n“Both reforms are grounded in the realities of Pakistan’s governance challenges and increasing complexity of state functions. These measures will help Pakistan evolve into a mature, rule-based democracy where judicial, civil and defence institutions perform their specialised roles in harmony,” he said.\n\nBut these explanations have so far failed to satisfy sceptics.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) questioned the urgency with which the amendment was tabled.\n\n“The government’s haste, including the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society, calls into question the very intention behind moving this amendment bill,” the HRCP said.\n\nHRCP deplores the manner in which the 27th Amendment to the Constitution is being tabled in Parliament. The government’s haste—including the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society—calls into question the…\n\n— Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (@HRCP87)  November 9, 2025\n\nOmer of the ICJ warned the amendment marked a “fundamental change” for the judiciary.\n\n“The 27th Amendment reduces the Supreme Court of Pakistan to only an appellate court. It is also no longer the ‘Supreme Court of Pakistan’ but only the ‘Supreme Court’ and its chief justice will be the CJ of the SC, not the CJ of Pakistan,” she said.\n\nThe judiciary, at least in the short and medium term, will be largely beholden to the executive, according to Omer.\n\n“Any real accountability or review of the executive and parliament appears unlikely. And any relief to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf against the wishes of the system also seems unlikely,” she added, referring to the largest opposition party, the PTI.\n\nThe PTI, led by former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been in jail for the past two years, governed from 2018 to 2022.\n\nIt was removed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence in April 2022. The party was disqualified from participating in last year’s elections, but independent candidates from the PTI nevertheless won the single largest share of seats (93) amid allegations of manipulation in the vote count, charges that the government rejected.\n\nNo party secured a majority, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) formed the government in coalition with the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP).\n\nMeanwhile, Hosain also cautioned that under the amendment, while the prime minister would continue to be exposed to political scrutiny and the will of elected representatives, immunity has been granted to the non-elected officials.\n\n“It institutionalises the supremacy of the uniform over the ballot,” she said.\n\nOmer pointed out that Pakistani political parties, including the PPP, now an alliance partner of the ruling PML-N, had in the past resisted constitutional protections to the military. That, she said, had now changed.\n\n“The 27th Amendment is constitutional surrender,” she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/pakistan-says-india-proxies-behind-islamabad-bombing-what-we-know-so-far","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:51:14+00:00","title":"Pakistan says ‘India proxies’ behind Islamabad bombing: What we know so far","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A suicide bombing at Islamabad’s District Judicial Complex on 11 November 2025 killed at least 12 people and injured over 30, with the Jamaa-ul-Ahrar claiming responsibility.

What we know so far\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan –  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has blamed India for the “suicide attack” that struck outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad  on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said at least 12 people were killed and hospital authorities confirmed more than 30 wounded, including at least five in critical condition.\n\nThe blast occurred as Islamabad hosted several international conferences and while sports events were also under way nearby. The Sri Lankan cricket team, which was attacked in March 2009 by gunmen in Pakistan, was playing a one-day international match in Rawalpindi, about 10km (6 miles) from the court.\n\nThe suicide attack marked a dramatic escalation of violence at a time when the military was focused on rescuing hundreds of cadets held by fighters in a separate incident at Cadet College in South Waziristan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the Afghan border.\n\nThe assault on the college in Wana, the district capital, occurred a day earlier when an explosives-laden car rammed the campus entrance. Security forces say at least 300 cadets have been rescued so far and that operations to free the remainder are ongoing.\n\nOn Tuesday, another bomb in Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, injured at least 14 security personnel.\n\nSharif blamed India for both the Islamabad and Wana incidents without offering evidence. “Both attacks are the worst examples of Indian state terrorism in the region. It is time for the world to condemn such nefarious conspiracies of India,” he said.\n\nA day earlier, a  car explosion in New Delhi  killed at least 13 people. India’s Home Minister Amit Shah said on X that India would “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.\n\nHere is what we know so far about the Islamabad blast.\n\nThe suicide bomber struck after 12:30pm (07:30 GMT) at the entrance of the District Judicial Complex on Srinagar Highway, one of Islamabad’s main arteries.\n\nOpened three years ago, the complex handles thousands of litigants and draws large numbers of lawyers daily. The complex has several gates, with a side entrance used primarily by judges and a main gate for litigants.\n\nKey political and civic institutions – the Parliament, Supreme Court, and offices of the president and prime minister – are about 15km (9 miles) away.\n\nThe Jamaa-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway faction of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) armed group, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe TTP, an ideological ally of the Afghan Taliban, itself denied any role in the Islamabad attack.\n\nPakistan has suffered a series of attacks from the TTP in recent years that have led to the deaths of hundreds of security officials and civilians. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the TTP, a charge Kabul denies. The TTP are at the centre of recent tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including a series of deadly cross-border clashes.\n\nPakistan’s capital, however, has largely stayed peaceful in recent years. The last major attack in Islamabad was in December 2022, when a car rammed a police post and a police officer died. The TTP had claimed responsibility for that attack.\n\nAs Islamabad’s main district court, the judicial complex sees thousands of litigants visiting the court premises for their various cases. Thousands of lawyers also come to the complex for their daily duties.\n\nRaja Aleem Abbasi, a member of the Islamabad Bar Council, was taking a break in the main courtyard when the blast shook the compound.\n\n“It was a deafening blast, and complete chaos and panic set in. As we regained composure, I saw the head of the suicide bomber, which had flown from outside, rolling just in front of me, merely a few feet away,” a shaken Abbasi told Al Jazeera.\n\nAbbasi, 60, said hundreds tried to flee, but the main entrance was blocked. “Soon, the entrance used for the judges was open for the public, allowing us to escape,” he added.\n\nHe estimated about 2,000 people were on the premises when the device detonated.\n\nMushahid Dawar, another lawyer, said he had left the compound on his motorcycle minutes before the blast but returned when he heard it.\n\n“I had left for the office from the court when I heard the blast, and instinctively I turned back. However, as I saw so many bodies strewn on the road, I just could not bear the sight and decided to leave,” Dawar told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe attacks coincide with a fraught period in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties. The two neighbours were locked in a week of clashes last month before Qatar and Türkiye mediated a ceasefire in Doha on October 19.\n\nFollow-up talks in Istanbul have, however, failed to resolve differences, and negotiations collapsed again over the weekend following the third round of talks.\n\nPakistan long enjoyed close ties with the Afghan Taliban and many Pakistanis welcomed the militants’ return to power in August 2021.\n\nBut relations have soured, largely over Pakistan’s accusations that Kabul has provided sanctuary to the TTP, an armed group that emerged in 2007 and has waged a sustained campaign against Islamabad.\n\nBesides the TTP, Pakistan also accuses Afghanistan of sheltering the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP). The Taliban government denies responsibility for Pakistan’s internal security concerns.\n\nRegional powers including China, Iran and Russia have urged the Taliban to act against the TTP. That message was reiterated at the Moscow Format consultations in early October, attended by Amir Khan Muttaqi, the Taliban’s foreign minister.\n\nShortly after the blast, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif wrote on X that the country was “in a state of war”.\n\n“Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: this is a war for all of Pakistan, in which the Pakistan Army is giving daily sacrifices and making the people feel secure,” he wrote.\n\nThe year 2025 has seen shifting regional alignments. Relations between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, once close, now stand at a breaking point, despite the current year seeing several attempts to patch up the relationship.\n\nPakistan appointed an ambassador to Kabul and engaged in multiple diplomatic dialogues, but relations have deteriorated.\n\nIndia, which long treated the Taliban as a Pakistani proxy and shunned contact, has, on the other hand, strengthened its diplomatic and strategic ties in recent years, as witnessed by a visit by Afghanistan’s foreign minister to India last year.\n\nIslamabad has historically accused New Delhi of stoking unrest in Balochistan and has more recently alleged Indian support for the TTP, charges India rejects.\n\nAnalysts warn that if tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan remain unresolved, instability is likely to spill across borders and provoke further attacks inside Pakistan’s cities.\n\nIhsanullah Tipu Mehsud, a security analyst in Islamabad, said the TTP has the capability to strike major cities but has largely concentrated its operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n“The Pakistani Taliban believe that if they continue attacking security personnel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, they can weaken the control of administration and that will allow them opportunity to capture parts of the province, where they can make their bases,” Mehsud told Al Jazeera.\n\nReferring to the recent Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes and the failed talks, Mehsud warned of a possible surge of violence in major cities. “If there is a war to take place against Afghanistan, Pakistan must be ready for the blowback, and to suffer losses,” he said. “There can be attacks against its key installations and symbols.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/tanzania-frees-opposition-leaders-following-deadly-election-protests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:56:07+00:00","title":"Tanzania frees opposition leaders following deadly election protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a disputed election that saw President Samia Suluhu Hassan declared the winner with nearly 98% of the vote, opposition leaders in Tanzania organized protests after Tundu Lissu was excluded from the presidential ballot.

main opposition party, Chadema.\n\nFour senior Chadema officials  arrested last week  for their alleged role in the protests were released on bail on Monday, the party said on social media.\n\nThe

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/you-can-do-anything-israeli-war-crimes-in-gaza-aired-in-uk-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:32:37+00:00","title":"‘You can do anything’: Israeli war crimes in Gaza aired in UK documentary","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UK documentary titled 'Breaking Ranks: Inside Israel’s War' aired on ITV, featuring testimonies from Israeli soldiers who describe participating in or witnessing war crimes in Gaza.

2025-11-11T16:32:37+00:00\n\nTitle: ‘You can do anything’: Israeli war crimes in Gaza aired in UK documentary\n\nAbout 30 minutes into a new documentary featuring testimonies of Israeli soldiers about being deployed to Gaza, a soldier reflects on the enclave after months of sustained Israeli war on it: “Terrible heat. Sand. Stench. And dogs wandering around in packs. They eat dead bodies … It’s horrifying … It’s a kind of zombie apocalypse. No trees. No bushes. No roads. There’s nothing.”\n\nThe documentary, Breaking Ranks: Inside Israel’s War, shown on UK network ITV on Monday, featured Israeli soldiers, some speaking of shame at having participated in what they concede is a genocide, others unflinchingly detailing the nature of that war.\n\nIncluded are the details of a firing policy that takes little to no account of cause, the wholesale destruction of property and homes, the systematic use of human shields, drone warfare and indiscriminate killing tied to a weaponised system of aid.\n\n“People don’t think about it,” one participant, credited as Eli, tells the camera. “Because if you do think about it, you’ll want to kill yourself.\n\n“When you take a moment to try and think about it, you want to scream,” he says, his face blacked out to obscure his identity.\n\nThrough its two years of genocidal war on Gaza, Israel has killed more than  69,000  people and injured hundreds of thousands more. International agencies say it will be decades before the enclave recovers, if it ever does.\n\nIsrael’s own intelligence suggests that  83 percent  of those it has killed in Gaza were civilians.\n\n“‘There are no civilians in Gaza,’ you hear it all the time,” Daniel, a commander with an Israeli tank unit, said. Another contributor, Major Neta Caspin, described a conversation with her brigade’s rabbi.\n\n“[He] sat down next to me and spent half an hour explaining why we must be just like they [Hamas] were on 7 October 2023. That we must take revenge on all of them, including civilians … that this is the only way,” she said.\n\nHamas’s armed wing led an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, during which 1,139 people died and about 250 were taken captive.\n\nArmoured Corps Captain Yotam Vilk described the suspension of all rules for firing on civilians – that they must have the means, intention and ability to pose a threat to Israeli soldiers.\n\n“There’s no such thing as means, intent and ability in Gaza,” Vilk explained. “It’s just ‘a suspicion of walking where it’s not allowed’,” he said, describing the overcrowded and chaotic interior of Gaza, where the precise limits on movement were known predominantly to Israeli troops alone.\n\n“Anyone who crosses the line is automatically incriminated and can be put to death,” Vilk added.\n\nThroughout its war, Israel has denied the growing number of accusations of war crimes from multiple bodies, claiming that it has investigated any credible allegations.\n\nHowever, in August, a  report  by UK monitor Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) showed that, of the limited investigations into accusations of war crimes by military investigators, including  the killing of 15 paramedics in April , few have resulted in any action.\n\nResponding to Israeli denials that it did not use human shields, tank commander Daniel was clear that the army “is lying”.\n\n“It’s called the ‘mosquito protocol’,” he said of the routine practice of seizing Palestinian civilians, strapping an iPhone to them and using them to explore suspected Hamas holdouts remotely.\n\n“Every company has its own ‘mosquito’,” he said, referring to captured Palestinians as insects. “That’s three Palestinians per battalion, nine to 12 per brigade, then dozens, if not hundreds, per division.”\n\nSome soldiers in his unit decided to release two teenage human shields they had captured out of concern they were breaking international law, Daniel recalled, adding that a senior officer said at the time: “Soldiers don’t need to know about international law, just the ‘[Israeli military] spirit’.”\n\nThrough its two years of war on Gaza, Israel has destroyed or damaged  92 percent  of its housing stock and displaced at least 1.9 million people, according to the  UN , many multiple times.\n\nAll the institutions, from universities to hospitals, that make up a  society  have been targeted for destruction. Social media videos uploaded by Israeli soldiers show an orgy of violence, with  Palestinian homes and belongings ransacked  and held up for ridicule by soldiers.\n\n“You feel that every day could be your last and that you can do anything,” one conscript who only gave his name as “Yaakov” said. “Not out of revenge, but just because you can.”\n\nOther participants talked of routinely burning Palestinian homes or celebrated their bulldozing.\n\nSpeaking from the illegal Israeli settlement of Beit El in the occupied West Bank, rabbinical judge Avraham Zarbiv – the subject of a war crimes  complaint  to the International Criminal Court – boasted of driving a bulldozer to destroy people’s homes and belongings during his time in Gaza.\n\n“I post a lot of videos,” he says, before cutting to one showing him driving a bulldozer, destroying homes in clear contravention of international law.\n\n“Until the end, until victory, until settlement. We will not give up until this village is wiped out,” he says in the video, telling the camera how his video “lift[s] soldiers’ spirits”.\n\nContinuing his comments, Zarbiv claimed credit for pioneering the tactic of destroying entire homes that is now commonplace.\n\n“We changed the conduct of an entire army,” he bragged. “Rafah is flattened. Jabalia is flattened. Beit Hanoon is flattened. Shujayea is flattened.

its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Professor Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/israeli-parliament-nods-to-bill-to-introduce-death-penalty-for","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:34:59+00:00","title":"Israel parliament passes first reading of death penalty for ‘terrorism’ law","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel’s parliament has passed the first reading of a death penalty bill proposed by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, which would impose capital punishment on individuals who kill Israelis out of racist motives aimed at harming the State of Israel.

Israel parliament passes first reading of death penalty for ‘terrorism’ law\n\nIsrael’s parliament has passed the first reading of a bill that would introduce the death penalty for “terrorism”.\n\nThe

Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/live-israel-kills-three-in-gaza-as-crews-work-to-find-thousands-of-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:46:12+00:00","title":"Israel kills 3 in Gaza, crews work to find thousands of missing in rubble","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a developing conflict in Gaza, Israel's military actions have resulted in the deaths of at least three individuals, with 35 unidentifiable bodies uncovered in Gaza City.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at age 97.

whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known as Super Typhoon Uwan in the Philippines, devastated northern provinces with deadly flash floods, landslides, and wind damage, killing at least 10 people and displacing over 1.4 million.

Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis\n\nThe 30th annual United Nations  climate change conference (COP30)  has started in the Brazilian city of Belem, with leaders calling for countries to take a united approach against global warming.\n\n“In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another – your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, told delegates on Monday.\n\nSome 50,000 people from more than 190 countries are expected to attend the 12-day event, which is being held at the edge of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.\n\nAddressing the conference, Stiell said that previous climate talks had helped, but that there was “much more work to do”.\n\nThe UN climate boss noted that countries would have to move “much, much faster” in driving down greenhouse gas emissions. “Lamenting is not a strategy. We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed at the start of COP30.\n\nBrazil’s leader condemned those seeking to undermine efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“They attack institutions, they attack science and universities,” he said. “It’s time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers.”\n\nThe United States is not sending any delegates to COP30 in keeping with President Donald Trump’s anti-climate change stance.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” the US’s former special envoy for climate, Todd Stern, said of the Trump administration’s decision.\n\nCOP30 President Andre Correa do Lago said the US’s absence “has opened some space for the world to see what developing countries are doing”.\n\nPablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru, urged world leaders to do more than simply give pledges at this year’s conference.\n\n“We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” he said.\n\nIn a letter to COP30 that was published on Monday, dozens of scientists expressed their fears about the melting of glaciers, ice sheets and other frozen parts of the planet.\n\n“The cryosphere is destabilising at an alarming pace,” they wrote. “Geopolitical tensions or short-term national interests must not overshadow COP30.

study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qpy1y09qwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"09:17:18.179+00:00","title":"O Yeong-Su: Squid Game star acquitted of sexual misconduct charge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"O Yeong-Su, the acclaimed South Korean actor known for his role in the global hit series Squid Game, was acquitted of sexual misconduct charges after a Suwon District Court overturned his 2024 conviction.

suitably devilish name.\n\nResearchers found the Megachile Lucifer while observing a rare wildflower that only grows in the Bremer Ranges in Western Australia's Goldfields region, 470km (292 miles) east of Perth.\n\nThe \"highly distinctive, prominent horns\" are only on the female bee and may be used as a defence mechanism, to gather pollen or nectar, or to collect materials such as resin for nests.\n\nThe study's lead scientist said she was inspired to use the name Lucifer as she was watching the Netflix show of the same name at the time. She adds it is the first new member of this bee group in 20 years.\n\n\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" said Dr Kit Prendergast from Curtin University .\n\n\"When writing up the new species description I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer at the time, and the name just fit perfectly. I am also a huge fan of the Netflix character Lucifer so it was a no-brainer.\"\n\nLucifer - which means \"light bringer\" in Latin - is also a reference to shining light on the need for better conservation of native bee species and greater understanding of how endangered plants are pollinated, she said.\n\nThe report, which was published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, also called for the area in and around where the new bee species and rare wildflowers were found to be \"formally protected and gazetted as conservation land that cannot be cleared\".\n\n\"Because the new species was found in the same small area as the endangered wildflower, both could be at risk from habitat disturbance and other threatening processes like climate change,\" she said, adding that many mining companies do not include native bees when assessing the environmental impact of their operations.\n\n\"So we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems.\n\n\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realise they're there.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80390pe1vvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"21:43:10.331+00:00","title":"Katie Razzall: Robust leadership needed to steer BBC through crisis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC is facing a major crisis due to a potential $1 billion lawsuit from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who claims defamatory statements were made in a Panorama documentary about him.

That, in fact, might have involved a bit of overreach.\n\nAfter all, this has happened before at the BBC. Back in 2004, two senior figures departed - admittedly not on the same day, but on subsequent days.\n\nThe then BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director general, Greg Dyke, resigned in light of the Hutton report.\n\nThat was the inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly which found that the BBC's reporting on the Iraq \"sexed-up dossier\" was flawed.\n\nBut my use of unprecedented on Monday feels entirely appropriate.\n\nA US president threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn is completely new territory for the corporation.\n\nWe've seen a succession of US media operations previously cave in as Donald Trump launched lawsuits.\n\nParamount Global paid him $16m to settle a dispute over an interview broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nABC News paid him $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit after its anchor falsely claimed he had been found \"liable for rape\".\n\nNow the president has the BBC in his sights. He wants a full retraction of the Panorama documentary, an apology for the \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements\" made about him in it, and appropriate compensation \"for the harm caused\".\n\nIf he doesn't get them by Friday, he's put the BBC \"on notice\" that he will be looking for damages of \"no less than $1,000,000,000\".\n\nWhether you are a supporter or a detractor of the BBC, I think everyone would agree these are incredibly testing times for the corporation.\n\nEvents have developed rapidly over a week.\n\nFirst we got the series of claims about the Panorama documentary and also wider systemic bias first made in the Telegraph.\n\nSix days later came the resignations of director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness.\n\nQuickly some were voicing concerns about a politically orchestrated campaign against the BBC from the right. Others said this was all about accountability in the face of gross failures.\n\nNow the BBC faces a potentially very costly legal battle with Donald Trump.\n\nIt should be basking in the success of Celebrity Traitors with the programme's hugely popular finale broadcast just last Thursday. Instead the BBC is plunged into a crisis some would argue of its own making.\n\nIt's taken until Monday to apologise for the Panorama edit and to push back on the notion that the corporation suffers from institutional bias.\n\nThe interview I did with BBC chair Samir Shah should have been done much earlier - with the DG or Deborah Turness last week, as the headlines ramped up.\n\nThe apology should have come then. Now the BBC is on the back foot.\n\nIt will take robust leadership to steer a course through. But two of the leaders most likely to have been able to steady the ship are now on the way out."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41g5w0vgno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:18:04.995+00:00","title":"Kate and Queen lay Armistice Day wreaths as nation pays tribute","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Armistice Day 2025, members of the British royal family, including the Princess of Wales, Queen Camilla, and Prince William, participated in national remembrance ceremonies in the UK, with the Princess of Wales attending the National Memorial Arboretum and Queen Camilla laying a wreath at Paddington Station.

It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"\n\nHoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.\n\nIt was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".\n\nHe then entered the water and began his slow descent.\n\nHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"\n\nBut Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\n\n\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\n\n\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"\n\nHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\n\n\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\n\n\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.\n\nThe Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.\n\nHe had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.\n\nIn addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\n\n\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo.\n\n\"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"\n\nBleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\n\n\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"\n\nAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.\n\nHoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\n\n\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"\n\nWhen they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.\n\nHoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\n\n\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"\n\nIt could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\n\n\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"\n\nSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.\n\nAnd he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\n\n\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"\n\nPointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\n\n\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ng120pggo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:12:47.142+00:00","title":"Turkey demands more than 2,000 years' jail for popular Istanbul mayor Imamoglu","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major political and legal development, Turkey’s Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu is facing 142 corruption charges, including bribery, money laundering, and fraud, with potential sentences of up to 2,430 years.

a spending bill to end the longest-ever government shutdown, the budget fight now moves to the House of Representatives.\n\nThe lower chamber of Congress is expected to vote this week on the funding measure.\n\nUnlike in the Senate, if House Republicans stay united, they don't need any Democrats to pass the budget. But the margin for error is razor thin.\n\nHere are four potential hold-ups for the budget, before it can clear Congress and land on the president's desk for signing into law.\n\nA key sticking point throughout the shutdown has been a desire on the part of Democrats to attach to the spending bill a renewal of tax credits that make health insurance less expensive for 24 million Americans.\n\nSenate Republicans instead only agreed to grant Democrats a vote in December on whether to extend the subsidies –  something they had already offered weeks ago.\n\nAnd House Speaker Mike Johnson would not commit on Monday to allowing a vote in his chamber on the tax credits.\n\nThis entails a fair degree of political risk for Republicans, however. If they torpedo the subsidies, health coverage premiums could rocket, handing Democrats a ready-made campaign issue for next year's midterm elections.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a conservative Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has broken ranks with President Donald Trump to warn that her party must ensure health insurance premiums do not spike.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the subsidies expiring by the end of December, Republicans are working out their plan.\n\nThey want income caps on who can receive the tax credits, and are proposing the tax dollars bypass insurance companies and go straight to individuals - although the details are unclear.\n\nOut of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House and Senate, Democrats appeared finally to have some political wind in their sails after a handful of election wins last week in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City.\n\nBut those victories, like the shutdown fight, have accentuated strategic tensions between the pragmatic and progressive, or left-wing, factions of the party.\n\nThe Democratic left is furious at defectors who voted with Senate Republicans to pass the budget on Monday, seeing this as a capitulation to Trump.\n\nFrom that wing of the party, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said giving up the fight was a \"horrific mistake\". California Governor Gavin Newsom called it \"surrender\".\n\nCongressman Greg Casar of Texas, the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, warned: \"A deal that doesn't reduce healthcare costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them.\"\n\nHowever, centrist lawmakers like Jared Golden of Maine, who represents one of the most conservative districts in the nation held by any Democrat, may cross the aisle.\n\nGolden, who recently announced he won't run for re-election, is likely to vote for the package, his office indicated to Axios, a political outlet, on Monday.\n\nAnother moderate Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, could help get the Republicans' spending plan over the line.\n\n\"It's past time to put country over party and get our government working again for the American people,\" he posted on social media on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans control the House, holding 219 seats against the Democrats' 213, but can only afford to lose two votes to pass the spending plan.\n\nWhile most House Republicans are expected to support the funding package, given that Trump backs it, fiscal hawks in the party will raise objections.\n\nThomas Massie of Kentucky - who has repeatedly voted against such stopgap funding extensions - is expected to vote no.\n\nThe proposed deal would leave the federal government on a path to keep adding about $1.8tn (£1.4tn) a year to its $38tn of debt.\n\nRand Paul of Kentucky cited this spending glut as he became the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the budget.\n\nThe Senate plan would extend funding only until January, but the conservative House Freedom Caucus wants a budget that would last longer and do more to rein in spending.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber out of session for the last seven weeks to focus pressure on Senate Democrats to make a shutdown deal.\n\nNow he is urging lawmakers to start returning immediately to Washington with a vote set for Wednesday afternoon at the earliest.\n\nBut members of Congress face the same flight delays that have plagued other Americans during the spending impasse.\n\nFrom Tuesday, the rate of reduction in US flights will increase to 6%. Cuts have been made as the nation's busiest airports reduce their capacity to cope with shutdown-related sickness by air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nRecord-cold temperatures and heavy snow have also hit the Great Lakes region in the Midwest, adding to the delays.\n\nYou can also get in touch by following this link"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvz6316zwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"01:07:21.608+00:00","title":"Syria to join coalition to defeat IS group after Trump meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a historic meeting at the White House, Syria has officially joined the international coalition to combat the Islamic State, marking a major shift in U.S. foreign policy.

Syria to join coalition to defeat IS group after Trump meeting\n\nSyria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, a senior Trump administration official has confirmed.\n\nThe announcement came as President Donald Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House - the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.\n\nIn an interview with Special Report on Fox News, al-Sharaa said the visit was part of a \"new era\" in which the country would co-operate with the US.\n\nTrump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.\n\nSyria will now be the 90th country to join the global coalition, which is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.\n\nFollowing the meeting, a senior administration official also confirmed that the US Treasury Department, along with the departments of state and commerce, will announce new measures to lift economic restrictions on Syria and provide \"compliance clarity for investors\".\n\nAs part of the measures, the administration is also issuing an 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act, which since 2019 had sanctioned the former Syrian government.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\"\n\n\"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\"\n\nDiplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although the US will now allow Syria to re-open its embassy in Washington.\n\nThis is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nAl-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist.\n\nNot long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties.\n\nEven until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head.\n\nThe Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.\n\nBut since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war.\n\n\"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nIn his interview, al-Sharaa said that he and Trump had not discussed his past, but instead focused on the \"present and the future\" of Syria in which it was a \"geopolitical\" and economic partner of Washington.\n\nAl-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.\n\nHe has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations.\n\nTrump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\".\n\nIn June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\".\n\nAt the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnveplv3lzmo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:45:28.074+00:00","title":"Catherine Connolly's becomes tenth president of

Republic of Ireland she said the country has been undergoing \"seismic changes\" since the end of the Cold War.\n\nShe said she was looking forward to her first visit to Northern Ireland as president and that she would foster an inclusive dialogue across the island.\n\nConnolly was elected in a  landslide vote at the end of October  - defeating Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys.\n\nThe 68-year-old takes over the role from Michael D Higgins, whose 14-year term ended at midnight.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by politicians, judges and other invited guests took place at Dublin Castle.\n\n\"We can and should take real pride in the success of the Good Friday Agreement model of peaceful resolution of conflict,\" she said.\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin congratulated Connolly on assuming office saying it was a \"happy and momentous\" day for her and her family.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's president is the country's head of state, however it is a non-executive

by the chief justice.\n\nA service of prayer and reflection took place during the ceremony.\n\nConnolly was presented with the Presidential Seal and made a speech.\n\nAs well as the Taoiseach (Irish

it is not a \"snub\" .\n\nHe said the party would be \"pleased\" to meet Connolly when she visits Northern Ireland in the future in her formal capacity.\n\nUlster Unionist Party MLA Steve Aiken is the only unionist politician who attended the inauguration in Dublin.\n\nHe confirmed he would be attending in place of party leader Mike Nesbitt who has other commitments.\n\nHe said it is not a bad look that he is the only unionist attending the event.\n\n\"I actually understand the reasons why some of them weren't able to make it, because obviously [Deputy First Minister] Emma Little Pengelly would

for those it deems terrorists passes first reading\n\nIsrael's parliament has passed the first reading of a bill proposing the death penalty for those it deems to be terrorists acting against the state - a requirement which means it is likely to be used only against Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis.\n\nThe bill - which has been condemned by the Palestinian Authority and human rights groups - was backed in the 120-seat Knesset by 39 votes to 16.\n\nFar-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir - whose Jewish Power party brought the vote - celebrated late on Monday by handing out sweets.\n\n\"After the law is finally passed - terrorists will only be released to hell,\" he said.\n\nThe bill must pass two more readings before becoming law.\n\nIn the same session, the Knesset also approved the first reading of another controversial bill allowing the Israeli government to close a foreign media outlet without court approval. That vote was 50 in favour and 41 against.\n\nThe legislation aims to turn a temporary order that allowed the closure of Qatari-owned Al Jazeera in May 2024, into a permanent law. It has been opposed by the government's legal advisers.\n\nWhile the death penalty does exist for a small number of crimes in Israel it has only been used twice since 1948 when the state was created. The last time was when the Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, was hanged in 1962, after a public trial.\n\nAn amendment to the penal code was demanded by the Jewish Power party and signed off by the Knesset's National Security Committee, which said in a statement that its purpose was to \"nip terrorism in the bud and create a weighty deterrent\".\n\nThe statement read: \"It is proposed that a terrorist convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred towards the public, and under circumstances where the act was committed with the intent to harm the State of Israel and the rebirth of the Jewish nation in its homeland will be sentenced to the death penalty - mandatory.\"\n\nThe clause about harming Israel makes it likely that Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks, but not Jewish Israelis, will be sentenced to death.\n\nThe foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank - called the proposed law a \"new form of escalating Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people\".\n\nBen-Gvir had long pushed for the death penalty bill to be brought to a Knesset vote, but such a move was previously opposed by Israeli political and security leaders who argued it could complicate efforts to free living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThat is no longer a concern since their return after the start of the Gaza ceasefire last month.\n\nBen-Gvir was one of just a few Israeli ministers who voted against the Gaza ceasefire deal which aimed to end the war. This saw 20 living hostages sent home in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including about 250 serving life sentences, many convicted of killing Israelis.\n\n\"A dead terrorist does not get released alive,\" commented Limor Son Har-Melech, a member of Jewish Power, and sponsor of the bill.\n\nIn 2003, during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, a then-pregnant Har-Melech and her husband - who lived in a settlement in the occupied West Bank - were attacked by Palestinian gunmen while in their car. Her husband was killed and she was injured, leading her to give birth by an emergency caesarean section.\n\nShe told the Knesset one of her husband's killers went on to be released in a previous exchange deal to bring home an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza. She said he went on to command a deadly attack on another Israeli and take part in the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, before he was killed during the Gaza war.\n\nResponding to the draft bill, Palestinian human rights organisations said its \"most alarming aspect\" would be that if it became law, it could be used to apply retroactively.\n\nThey suggested its intent was \"executing collective death sentences that could target hundreds of Palestinian detainees from the Al-Qassam Brigades' elite forces who were arrested on or after 7 October\", referring to Hamas's military wing.\n\nIsrael's justice minister has already said he is seeking Knesset legislation to set up a special criminal tribunal to try Gazans accused of involvement in the attacks of 7 October 2023, in a process that could result in death sentences being handed down to those convicted.\n\nSome 1,200 people were killed two years ago in the cross-border attack on southern Israel by several thousand armed Hamas fighters. In the war that it triggered, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 69,000 people were killed in Gaza.\n\nThe push by Israeli lawmakers to formalise what has become known as the \"Al Jazeera Law\" also follows on from the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nDuring the war, a ban imposed by Israel's ministry of communications forced Al Jazeera to close its office at a hotel in occupied East Jerusalem. The Israeli military then ordered the closure of the network's office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, claiming it was a threat to national security.\n\nIsrael accused Al Jazeera of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas in its news coverage. Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied such accusations and condemned Israel's actions.\n\nThe new international media legislation would give the government permanent powers to stop foreign broadcasters in Israel, even outside times of war or national emergency and would remove the need for judicial oversight.\n\nLast year, when petitioning the High Court of Justice against the temporary order allowing sanctions on foreign broadcasters, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) argued that \"the law violates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press, and blocks citizens and residents from receiving a variety of information that does not fit the Israeli narrative or is not broadcast on Israeli media channels.\"\n\nThe two controversial bills are expected to be prepared for second and third parliamentary readings."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:45:21.354+00:00","title":"Is the US government shutdown over, and why did it happen?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged government shutdown in the United States, the longest in nearly seven years, has ended after a bipartisan Senate deal passed 60-40 on 10 November 2025.

shutdown over, and why did it happen?\n\nA deal to reopen the US government  has cleared the Senate , bringing the budget stand-off between Republicans and Democrats in Congress closer to an end.\n\nIt needs to be approved in the House of Representatives before the current shutdown -  the longest on record  - will officially be over.\n\nUntil then, many - but not all - US government services will still be temporarily suspended, and around 1.4 million federal employees will remain on unpaid leave or continue working without pay.\n\nA new funding bill finally passed the Senate 60-40 on 10 November, after seven Democrats and one independent sided with Republicans to approve the measure.\n\nBut it will still take days to reopen the government, even if the budget swiftly clears the House of Representatives and is signed into law by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe deal only extends money for the federal government until 30 January, but would fund food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) until September 2026.\n\nIt guarantees that all federal workers will receive back-pay, and reverses the shutdown-related layoffs of thousands of federal workers.\n\n\"I'll abide by the deal,\" Trump said.\n\nDemocrats will get a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire by the end of the year, a key sticking point, although Republicans offered them this weeks ago.\n\nThe funding bill now heads to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nThe party only has a two-seat majority in the lower chamber so the vote is expected to be close.\n\nMost House Republicans are expected to support the funding bill, but House Democrats are expected to oppose it.\n\nComplicating the path forward, House Republicans have not committed to vote on the healthcare subsidy part of the deal, unlike their Senate counterparts.\n\n\"I'm not promising anybody anything,\" said Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nIn the US system, both chambers of Congress must approve a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nThe Republicans currently control both the House of

The party's main demand was that the bill should include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans.\n\nThe House was able to pass a temporary funding bill to avoid the shutdown, but it could not clear the Senate amid Democratic resistance.\n\nSo on 1 October, the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nThousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave.\n\nBut not all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown.\n\nFederal law enforcement are expected to operate as usual, Social Security and Medicare cheques are still distributed, and mail is delivered. The Trump administration has so far found money to pay the troops.\n\nAir traffic controllers are also expected to work without pay, but some of them have been calling in sick, leading to many flights being cancelled or delayed.\n\nMore than 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP food aid benefits have received only partial payments after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to withhold some funding pending further legal hearings.\n\nWhile most federal employees are not paid during a shutdown, members of Congress do continue to receive their salary.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still causes problems. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracts are suspended.\n\nUnlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once a shutdown ends, and many of them are small businesses without other big clients.\n\nOverall,  analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth  for each week that it continues - about $15bn a week.\n\nShutdowns over budgets  are a unique aspect of US politics .\n\nThe second-longest ever shutdown dragged on for 35 days, beginning in late 2018 during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nBut these legislative standoffs predate the current president.\n\nThere were eight shutdowns during the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

immigration enforcement, his family said on Monday.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  arrested Hamdi , a media commentator and outspoken critic of Israel, last month while he was on a speaking tour in the US.\n\nThe State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged at the time that Hamdi supports terrorism and poses a threat to national security, while his lawyers have argued he was targeted for criticising Israel and its war in Gaza.\n\nHamdi will be released from ICE detention in the next few days and return to the UK, his representatives say.\n\nHamdi was visiting the US to speak at events for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy group, when ICE officers arrested him at the San Francisco International Airport on 26 October.\n\nHis detainment came after the US government revoked Hamdi's visa and criticism from far-right political activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who accused him of supporting terrorists.\n\n\"We've said it before, we'll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans\", the State Department said of Hamdi at the time he was detained.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the US State Department, ICE, and DHS for comment and confirmation of the agreement to release Hamdi.\n\nLawyers for Hamdi and the California chapter of CAIR said in a Monday statement that they welcome an agreement allowing Hamdi to voluntarily return to the UK instead of facing deportation.\n\nThey said he was targeted for speaking against \"Israel's war crimes against Palestinians\".\n\nCAIR said that the immigration charging document filed in Hamdi's case only accuses him of overstaying his visa, which the government revoked without notifying him first.\n\nThe organisation said the charging document does not identify \"any criminal conduct or security grounds\", which it said was proof that Hamdi was never a danger to the community or to national security.\n\n\"It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell. His only real 'offense' was speaking clearly about Israel's genocidal war crimes against Palestinians,\" Hussam Ayloush, the CEO of California's CAIR chapter, said in the news release.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) did not confirm details of Hamdi's detainment or release but told the BBC that it was providing consular assistance to a \"British man detained in the USA\". The office said it has also been in touch with the man's family and with local US authorities.\n\n\"This decision brings joy to me, his mother, his wife, our entire family, and all of Sami's supporters around the world,\" Hamdi's father, Dr Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi, wrote on X.\n\n\"However, it does not erase the bitterness and shock we all feel over what happened to him in the United States — his arrest and the defamation of his reputation and character by US government-affiliated accounts without any legitimate reason whatsoever.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p1zx4dkro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:00:10.099+00:00","title":"Wicked For Good premiere: Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Jonathan Bailey hit the yellow brick road at European premiere","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The European premiere of Wicked: For Good, a sequel to the beloved musical film, took place in London’s Leicester Square, where fans dressed in Oz-inspired attire.

the yellow brick road at European premiere\n\nAriana Grande has said her new darker hair is not about saying goodbye to her Wicked character Glinda, but rather a way of “doing something different”.\n\nThe singer and actress, 32, has recently swapped her signature, Glinda-era blonde locks with a brunette tone, sending fans wild on social media.\n\nIt comes as she resumes her role as the Good Witch of the North alongside Cynthia Erivo, who returns as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, in Wicked: For Good.\n\nOn Monday night, London’s Leicester Square was transformed into the magical Land of Oz, with Wicked-inspired shades of pink and green and a sprawling yellow brick road running through the middle.\n\nFans came dressed in witches' hats and green makeup, while others channelled their inner Glinda in sparkly floor length gowns.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, Erivo, who was recently nominated for two Grammys, said it felt “overwhelming” to be closing the Wicked chapter.\n\n“It feels beautiful though,” said Grande. “This project will always be part of our lives.”\n\nThe sequel will see Grande and Erivo joined once again by co-stars Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard.\n\nBridgerton star Bailey, 37, who reprises his role of Prince Fiyero, has recently made history by becoming People's first-ever openly gay \"Sexiest Man Alive\".\n\nWhen asked by BBC News who his sexiest man of the year is, he didn’t skip a beat.\n\n“Jon M Chu,” he said, naming Wicked’s film director. “Because his genius, and his compassion, knows no end.”\n\nHe then laughed, adding: “And because he cast me in this film, so that is entirely sexy.”\n\nThe sequel has a romantic plotline, which could lead some to wonder whether Bailey was channelling his inner Anthony (his Bridgerton character).\n\n“I’m sure I’m mining something that’s in my bones somewhere,” he says.\n\nAs a sidebar, I also had to ask him whether  would ever do Celebrity Traitors .\n\n“The answer is, we’ll have to find out,” he said, pausing dramatically before laughing. “I feel like I’m already exposing my game play.”\n\nWhen Grande unveiled her new look on Instagram recently, many fans speculated that it was a way for her to bid farewell to her Good Witch character.\n\nBut when asked about that, she said: “No, I think it was just a way of doing something different for the second movie, and playing into the darker tones, with clothing and beauty.\n\n“It’s fun,” she said, while Erivo smiled and nodded.\n\nThe sequel picks up where the first film left off and covers the years after Elphaba and Glinda's decision to part ways.\n\nElphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard.\n\nThe films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel.\n\nHowever, the stage musical was split into two films for its big-screen adaptation.\n\nThey were shot simultaneously between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors' strike.\n\nWicked  was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK , and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.\n\nAt two hours 40 minutes, the first film alone was almost as long as the entire length of the stage show.\n\nBut the second film is slightly shorter, at 2 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nErivo and Grande's chemistry and real-life friendship prompted several viral interview moments during the first film's promotional run last year, and the pair jointly opened the Academy Awards in March with a Wicked medley.\n\nOne challenge facing the sequel is that most of the best known songs from the musical, such as Defying Gravity, Popular and The Wizard And I, featured in the first film.\n\nBut the forthcoming follow-up will feature two brand new songs, with Chu telling BBC News that the first time Grande and Erivo heard them, “they just cried”.\n\n“It means a lot to now, however many years later, we’re here and people get to see it on the big screen. I’m so excited.”\n\nWicked For Good is in cinemas on 21 November."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:44:10.438+00:00","title":"Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Qian Zhimin, a Chinese woman, was sentenced to 11 years and 8 months in prison for money laundering after orchestrating a massive cryptocurrency fraud targeting over 100,000 Chinese pensioners.

Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul.\n\n\"If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,\" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. \"Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost.\"\n\nQian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after  Chinese police started investigating her .\n\nShe moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend.\n\nSo she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property.\n\nAs Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could \"get rich while lying down\". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping.\n\nBut Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke.\n\nHer grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022.\n\nIn the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth.\n\nPolice raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history.\n\nQian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices.\n\nBut UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme.\n\n\"The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,\" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC.\n\nOne of her investo r s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day.\n\n\"That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,\" he says.\n\nHe and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more.\n\nIn addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them.\n\n\"There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment.\"\n\nInvestors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found.\n\nA former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends.\n\nLantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: \"We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance.\"\n\nThe company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready.\n\nLantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly.\n\n\"Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,\" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. \"They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world.\"\n\nA range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said.\n\n\"We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?\"\n\nThe company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to.\n\n\"That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,\" Mr Yu says.\n\nDespite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog.\n\nBut she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li.\n\n\"Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,\" he remembers. \"We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth.\n\n\"She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations.\"\n\nMr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them.\n\nA Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme.\n\n\"The payouts suddenly stopped,\" Mr Yu recalls. \"The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough.\"\n\nWhat helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police.\n\nWhat he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money.\n\nQian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project.\n\nWhen she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told.\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.\n\nQian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a \"Bitcoin pioneer\", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she \"never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her\".\n\nBefore her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a \"glimpse of sunlight\".\n\nThe cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a  civil \"proceeds of crime\" case  that will start in earnest early next year.\n\nThere are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain.\n\nIt is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value.\n\nAs in other \"proceeds of crime\" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond.\n\nSeparately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage.\n\nThe toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC.\n\nStill, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine.\n\nMr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said.\n\n\"She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst.\"\n\nMr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines:\n\n\"Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr0g78y0zro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:39:23.879+00:00","title":"Ghana's Asante king welcomes return of artefacts from the UK and South Africa","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ghana's Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II has welcomed the return of 130 artefacts from the UK and South Africa, including items looted during colonial times and those acquired on the open market.

from the UK and South Africa some of which were looted during colonial times and others bought on the open market.\n\nThe items included royal regalia, drums and ceremonial gold weights, dating back to the 1870s - and reveal the cultural role gold played in Asante society.\n\nTwenty-five of the pieces were donated by British art historian Hermione Waterfield and the rest by South African mining company AngloGold Ashanti.\n\nHanding over the pieces at a ceremony at the Manhyia Palace, in the city of Kumasi, officials from AngloGold Ashanti said the gesture was made as an act of cultural respect and reconciliation.\n\nThere have been tensions in the central Ashanti region between AngloGold Ashanti and residents, who have accused the company of exploiting mineral resources without doing much to develop the area or create jobs.\n\nAsante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II thanked AngloGold Ashanti for voluntarily returning artefacts legitimately acquired on open markets.\n\nIt reflected \"goodwill and respect for the source and legacy of the Asante kingdom\", the monarch said.\n\nThe reception took place on Sunday, according to a statement released after the event from the palace.\n\nMs Waterfield was a pioneering figure and curator at Christie's auction house in London and took a special interest in African art, establishing a department that focused on tribal art in the 1970s.\n\nShe has long been a supporter of West African art restitution.\n\nAccording to Manhyia Palace Museum director Ivor Agyeman-Duah, Ms Waterfield's gifts included a wooden drum looted during the 1900 siege of Kumasi by British colonial forces.\n\nBritish soldiers were involved in a series of conflicts in the late 19th Century in what were called the Anglo-Asante wars. The palace of the king, or Asantehene, was plundered twice.\n\nThe call by African countries for the return of looted items has been met with some success in recent years - though some items are only on loan.\n\nLast year,  32 looted artefacts went on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum  as part of a three-year loan agreement between two British museums - the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and British Museum - and the Asante king.\n\nIn 2022, Germany was the first country to return Benin bronzes to Nigeria  in a bid to deal with its \"dark colonial history\" .\n\nThey were looted by British troops in 1897 from the West African kingdom of Benin, in modern-day Nigeria's Edo state - and many were auctioned off in London and are in collections all over the world.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/trump-government-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:55:34-05:00","title":"For Trump, Nothing Was Off Limits During the Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history, marked by unprecedented actions from President Donald Trump, included cutting food stamps for millions, firing thousands of government workers, withholding back pay, and canceling funding for projects in Democratic-led states.

government officials, campaigners and lobbyists are holed up in meeting rooms in an effort to come up with ideas and action-plans to prevent an impending climate crisis.\n\nEvery delegation has its interests, and negotiations at UN climate talks are all about compromise. Which is a problem Australia knows all too well as it engages in parallel negotiations of its own in Belém.\n\nFor some time now, there's been a deadlock between Australia and Turkey over who will host next year's meeting – and it all needs to be ironed out by the end of next week when the talks come to a close. If no agreement between the two is reached, hosting will default to the German city of Bonn, where the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is headquartered.\n\nBrazil would have preferred the matter be sorted out much sooner, mindful that the quiet chatter in COP corridors about the next presidency will soon become deafening, with neither side backing down.\n\nBack in 2022, Australia put together a convincing proposition of co-hosting COP31 with the Pacific.\n\nA year after focusing on rainforests in Brazil, the oceans would be in the spotlight. Rising sea levels  are a constant talking point , and Pacific islanders have the most to lose.\n\nFiji held the presidency in 2017 but the talks themselves took place in Bonn – 2026 would be a chance for the world to see first-hand the effects of climate change.\n\nFor Australia, showing commitment to its neighbours was good domestic politics.\n\n\"Having it close to your home means you can create space for the greatest ambition,\" says Shiva Gounden of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. \"The Pacific has always led in trying to come up with ambition that really addresses the climate crisis.\"\n\nBut it was also good geopolitics, putting on a united front with the Pacific, a region where Chinese influence is growing. Australia's position would be strengthened, the Pacific would be put on the map. It felt like a win-win.\n\nHow times change. Now, Australia's bid to co-host COP with the Pacific looks like it's faltering. And possibly failing.\n\nAustralia has long maintained it has overwhelming support to host next year's summit.\n\nIn fact, more than two years ago, in my conversations with diplomatic sources, there was an extremely confident prediction that this was Australia's bid to lose. It was just a question of coming to a deal with Turkey, but the belief was that that wouldn't be an insurmountable problem.\n\nRecently several options have been floated, including reportedly splitting the hosting rights with Ankara.\n\n\"There was a fair bit of complacency early on in the process,\" says Gavan McFadzean of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who is currently in Belém. \"[There was] an assumption that an Australian/Pacific joint presidential bid would just sail through.\"\n\nBut Turkey is not budging on its desire to host. While that's not Australia's fault, many feel more could have been done to push Australia's credentials as a climate leader.\n\nAt the COP leaders' meeting last week, several dozen leaders attended including the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. President Erdogan of Turkey didn't show up; neither did Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. It's not a strong signal of Australia's commitment.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC last week, the president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, who has been one of the biggest Pacific voices when it comes to climate change, said it was \"crunch time\", arguing that Albanese's presence could hopefully \"push Turkiye over the line.\"\n\nHosting COP was an election promise by Albanese, but it's not a universally popular political move.\n\nWhile the expense of bringing COP here is often cited by critics - recent reports put it at A$1bn ($650m; 500m pounds) -  supporters of hosting COP talk about the investment and tourism it will bring to Australia, especially Adelaide where it would be hosted.\n\nBut there's also a lot to lose for Australia more broadly.\n\nThere's been a fair bit of criticism over UN climate talks in recent years. Last year, in Azerbaijan, the president said that natural gas was \"a gift from God\". The year before that, the talks were hosted in Dubai – a city in one of the richest oil states in the world.\n\nTurkey, if it wins, has close ties with the Russia and Saudi Arabia, both countries who have frustrated past efforts to move forward on climate action.\n\nSo there was a view that Australia could help turn around the COP brand. The idea being that Australia is one of the \"good ones\", committed to bringing down emissions and working multilaterally to reach UN goals.\n\nOnly there's a big flaw in that argument - Australia is the largest exporter of coal in the world and one of the biggest natural gas exporters. Australia has one of the highest per capita emissions globally.\n\nWhile Albanese has made strong commitments to tackle climate change - his government recently committed to bringing down emissions in 2035 to between 60 and 72% of 2005 levels - his administration has also recently  extended the North West Shelf , one of Australia's largest gas projects.\n\nIt's trying to embrace the transition to renewables but knows that its loyalties - and its wealth -  lie in fossil fuel exports.\n\nThe minister for climate change and energy, Chris Bowen, has been a huge champion of Australia co-hosting COP. But several sources have told me that Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have been less than enthusiastic about the prospect.\n\nDoes Australia want to come under such scrutiny? Perhaps not everyone in the government will be upset if it can't pull off the bid."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/iraq-election-what-to-know.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:01:06-05:00","title":"Iraqis Are Voting for a New Parliament.

But that will not immediately fix the problems afflicting air travel.\n\nEven if the government ends the flight restrictions in place at 40 busy airports that contributed to widespread disruptions over the weekend, it will take days for airlines to recover. And longstanding challenges to the nation’s aviation system remain.\n\n“Even before the shutdown, there was widespread recognition that we were dealing with an ailing air traffic control system,” a coalition of groups representing all facets of aviation, from pilots to airlines to airplane manufacturers, said in an open letter to Congress on Tuesday, urging lawmakers to reopen the government.\n\nCongress approved $12.5 billion this year to modernize the air traffic control system, and the Transportation Department has prioritized hiring more air traffic controllers. But “the shutdown takes all of that in the wrong direction,” said the letter, which was published in a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post.\n\nThere is a shortfall of about 3,000 air traffic controllers, leaving the more than 14,000 working long, stressful schedules. The shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, has increased the pressure on those controllers, who are considered essential and required to work despite not being paid. Some of them have taken other jobs to make ends meet.\n\nCiting the need to relieve the stress on those controllers and improve air safety, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut flights by 4 percent at 40 of the nation’s busiest airports starting last Friday. That, alongside controller staffing shortages, contributed to thousands of canceled flights over the weekend. The disruption peaked on Sunday, when about one in 10 scheduled flights did not take off, making it the fourth-worst day of the year for flight cancellations.\n\nThe disruptions have extended into this week, as the agency’s restrictions increased to 6 percent on Tuesday and will reach 10 percent on Friday, threatening to cause chaos for Thanksgiving travel.\n\nThousands of flights across the United States have been canceled, with deeper cuts looming in the coming days.\n\nBut there is hope that the holiday will be spared. The Senate approved a deal on Monday to end the shutdown, and the House could act quickly to pass it, too.\n\nIt could still take days for airlines to recover. That is because carriers canceled flights days in advance to give customers notice about the disruptions and to ensure that pilots, flight attendants and planes were all in place for the flights that would operate as scheduled.\n\n“Airlines’ reduced flight schedules cannot immediately bounce back to full capacity right after the government reopens,” Airlines for America, a trade group that represents the largest passenger and cargo airlines, said in a statement on Monday. “It will take time, and there will be residual effects for days.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/books/bookstores-food-banks-snap-recipients.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:31:58-05:00","title":"To Help SNAP Recipients, Bookstores Set Up as Food Banks","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As federal funding for SNAP, a key government nutrition program, faced potential suspension during a prolonged government shutdown, independent bookstores across the U.S. emerged as critical community hubs for food donation and distribution.

Lincoln, Neb., went to their boss with an idea: If people were going hungry, maybe they could help.\n\nWorkers at the store, Sower Books, soon set up a food collection bin near the front door. Customers and neighbors brought in bags and boxes of groceries; others came to browse for books, saw the bin and returned later with their own donations. Within a week, the storage room was stuffed with close to 2,000 pounds of food.\n\nNearly out of storage space, the bookstore put out a call for drivers on social media, and earlier this month, customers volunteered their cars and pickup trucks to ferry boxed and canned goods to a food pantry across town. The store’s back room has since filled up again with donations. On Monday, staff members made another run to the pantry, delivering more than 830 pounds of food — enough for roughly 1,700 meals.\n\n“The community is really coming out, I think, because the bookstore is so loved,” said Lori Hirt, a regular customer who saw the bookstore’s request for drivers on Instagram and came with a pickup truck.\n\nTory Hall, Sower’s owner, said the food drive felt like a natural extension of the store’s role as a community gathering place, where people drop in to do puzzles, have coffee, attend a book club and snuggle with the store’s adoptable rescue cats. Many customers seemed grateful that Sower gave them an easy way to help, Hall said.\n\n“We’re not sitting here sad that everything is burning,” Hall said. “We’re going to find a fire extinguisher.”\n\nAs members of Congress inched toward an end to the longest government shutdown in history, communities around the country sought ways to help people affected by the suspension of federal benefits including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps tens of millions of low-income Americans buy groceries. And with the shutdown creating anxiety and uncertainty for those who depend on government aid, many independent bookstores took on a new role as hubs for food donations.\n\nPaul Swydan, the owner of The Silver Unicorn Bookstore in Acton, Mass., said when the news came out that SNAP would be suspended, “we kind of took that personally.” His store keeps a large plastic bin outside the front door, where customers can leave donations for their local food pantry. To augment that, the store held a six-day food drive called a “bag for a bag.” In exchange for a bag of food, the store offered a free Silver Unicorn tote bag, which usually sells for $15. Though many customers, Swydan said, wouldn’t take the gift.\n\n“By the end of Sunday, you could barely walk through the store,” Swydan said. The donations filled his Chevy Traverse SUV and his floor manager’s minivan.\n\nRiver Bend Bookshop, a Connecticut bookstore with locations in Glastonbury and West Hartford, learned about The Silver Unicorn’s food drive and decided to start their own “tote for tote” donation drive. “We were like, this is phenomenal, we have a lot of tote bags, let’s do this,” said Aislinn Gara Grady, who manages events for the store. Customers brought in around 100 bags of groceries during the first week of November, and staff members drove the donations to nearby food banks.\n\nIndependent bookstores have long operated as hubs for activism and community service. In recent years, some stores have increasingly waded into political and social issues by conducting voter registration drives, sending free books to L.G.B.T. Q. prison inmates and distributing emergency contraceptives to women in states where abortion access has been restricted.\n\nDozens of bookstores have rallied around the issue of food insecurity in recent weeks, according to the American Booksellers Association. Magic City Books in Tulsa, Okla., said it will donate 10 percent of all sales from Nov. 1 to Nov. 27 to the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma. Powell’s Books in Portland, Ore., placed food collection bins in their stores. Old Town Books in San Angelo, Texas, is offering customers who donate canned goods a discount on books. Bike Trail Books in Loveland, Ohio, received thousands of dollars in donations to pay for gift cards to Kroger grocery stores that it has made available to community members.\n\nStaff members at Werner Books & Coffee in Erie, Pa., have been collecting shelf stable food to distribute to the dozen “little free food pantries” across the city. Anyone can leave food in those cupboards, which are often built outside of churches or people’s homes, and anyone can take it.\n\n“The little free pantry, I think, is really cool because there’s no barrier for entry for families,” said Kyle Churman, one of the owners of Werner Books. “You don’t have to go into a building, you don’t have to see anybody. That’s a big thing with poverty: the shame.”\n\nCustomers can leave food in a wicker basket near the store’s cafe, which a barista sorts and loads into boxes between drink orders. Churman then drives the boxes to food pantries.\n\nKaty Perez, who owns a tiny bookstore in Tyler, Texas, called The Headless Librarian, posted on Instagram and TikTok asking customers to bring canned goods to her bookstore that she could pass along to a local food pantry. The pantry told her “kid-friendly food” like canned ravioli and SpaghettiOs would be especially welcome, because so many parents come into food pantries hoping to feed their children.\n\n“During times like this, it’s hard to look away,” Perez said. “I just thought, I’m very small, and I don’t know how much of an impact I can make. But I have to do something.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/politics/panama-noriega-maduro.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:52:13-05:00","title":"How the Heavy-Metal Fall of a Dictator Shapes Trump’s Venezuela Policy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article draws a direct historical parallel between the 1989 U.S. military operation to capture Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and current discussions about the potential military or political action against Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.

A Latin American strongman was in hiding, surrounded by American troops, heavy metal blaring through the night.\n\nIn December 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega’s run as dictator of Panama was reaching a humiliating end. American troops had invaded the country with orders to capture Mr. Noriega and bring him to trial.\n\nThey would wind up surrounding his final hide-out, tormenting him for 10 days with loudspeakers blasting songs from the likes of Black Sabbath and Guns N’ Roses until he surrendered into handcuffs.\n\nToday, as President Trump considers military action in Venezuela, the parallels between Mr. Noriega and Mr. Maduro grow more and more significant, and some Trump officials hope the Venezuelan president will meet a similar fate.\n\nLike Mr. Noriega more than 30 years ago, Mr. Maduro has been federally indicted on drug trafficking charges. And U.S. officials maintain that the Venezuelan is not a foreign leader but a criminal who must be “brought to justice,” as Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently said.\n\nIn a national address announcing the invasion of Panama, President George H.W. Bush laid out his grounds for moving against Mr. Noriega, a defiant nationalist who brandished a machete in public and hosted cocaine-fueled parties at his lavish mansions. They included Mr. Noriega’s dictatorial rule, concerns about the security of the Panama Canal, and the brash general’s increasing hostility toward the United States. (In a final straw, Mr. Noriega’s forces had killed a U.S. Marine at a roadblock.)\n\nBut Mr. Bush also stressed Mr. Noriega’s status as a wanted criminal. The Justice Department had indicted him on charges of taking huge bribes in return for letting drug traffickers ship cocaine through his country.\n\n“I directed our armed forces to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama and to bring General Noriega to justice in the United States,” Mr. Bush said.\n\nFor Mr. Noriega, escape was never an option. As Operation Just Cause began, a team of Navy SEALs crept onto an airfield and blasted Mr. Noriega’s personal Learjet with an anti-tank gun. SEAL divers sank a potential getaway boat with explosives. In all, some 27,000 American troops deployed.\n\nAs the assault began, a panicked Mr. Noriega, accompanied by a mistress, wove through Panama City in an unmarked Hyundai and went into hiding. At one point, he ducked incognito into a Dairy Queen before taking refuge in the embassy of the Holy See in Panama City. Delta Force commandos and U.S. Army tanks quickly surrounded the building, which they could not storm, and demanded his surrender.\n\nWhen he refused, the music kicked in. The playlist was designed for maximum stress — and ridicule: Bon Jovi’s “Wanted Dead or Alive,” Van Halen’s “Panama,” Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”\n\nBrent Scowcroft, who was serving as national security adviser to Mr. Bush, later called the tactic “a low moment in U.S. Army history.”\n\nBut Mr. Noriega eventually surrendered and was hauled to Florida for trial. (The general’s years of service as a secret C.I.A. asset providing intelligence about Latin America were not enough to save him.) He was convicted and spent the rest of his life in prison until just before his death in 2017 in a Panamanian hospital after brain surgery.\n\nMr. Noriega may be gone, but his story has not been forgotten — not by Mr. Maduro or Trump administration officials, many of whom have spent years trying to topple the Venezuelan leader.\n\nMr. Noriega’s capture sometimes came up during debates in Mr. Trump’s first term about how to deal with Mr. Maduro, according to two former officials from the time. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, then the national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence and now a presidential envoy to Ukraine, had firsthand experience in Panama as an infantry assault commander during the operation.\n\nAmong the options Trump officials considered at the time were a large-scale U.S. invasion of the country and “a smaller, special operation targeted directly at Maduro,” Mr. Trump’s former defense secretary Mark Esper wrote in a 2022 memoir.\n\nBut the similarities between Panama 1989 and Venezuela 2025 are dangerously misleading, some analysts warn. Any U.S. effort to apprehend or kill Mr. Maduro, they say, would be far more treacherous than the operation to corral Mr. Noriega.\n\n“When people talk very loosely and say, ‘Well, we’ll just take him out,’ it’s useful to recall 1989,” said Michael Shifter, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service with extensive experience in Latin America.\n\n“When one confronts the realities of what it would require, you conclude how crazy it would be to commit American troops for regime change in Venezuela,” he added.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, U.S. efforts to depose hostile Latin American rulers have largely been failures. They include Mr. Trump’s own unsuccessful first-term push to oust Mr. Maduro, which sought to capitalize on the street protests across Venezuela in 2019.\n\nStill, experts say the similarities between 1989 and today must be unsettling to Mr. Maduro.\n\n“There are parallels,” said Elliott Abrams, who served as U.S. special envoy for Venezuela during Mr. Trump’s first term. “One is that the guy running the government is someone we do not view as a legitimate head of government. And both are drug traffickers.”\n\nIn September, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Mr. Maduro was “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.” The Venezuelan leader, she added, “will not escape justice.”\n\nAnd like Mr. Noriega, who ran Panama though puppet politicians, Mr. Maduro is considered an illegitimate ruler by the United States because of the fraudulent elections that have kept him in power since 2013. Trump officials say he is more accurately described as a criminal cartel leader.\n\nAs a Republican senator from Florida in 2019, Mr. Rubio posted images on Twitter of several toppled dictators in what was widely seen as a warning to Mr. Maduro, as domestic unrest and U.S. pressure mounted. They included before-and-after shots of Mr. Noriega — first waving his machete before a crowd, next posing for his federal mug shot.\n\nMore recently, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida and an ally of Mr. Rubio’s, warned in a late September interview that Mr. Maduro might “rot in jail for the rest of his life like Noriega.”\n\nMr. Trump may be deterred from major military action in Venezuela by the scale of the challenge. Panama was an easy target — a small country with a weak military, and in 1989, U.S. troops were already stationed there guarding the Panama Canal. Venezuela is about 12 times larger than Panama, with a population more than 10 times greater than Panama’s in 1989.\n\nAnd even the puny Panama Defense Forces put up enough resistance to kill 23 U.S. troops, including four of the elite Navy SEALS who carried out the assault on Mr. Noriega’s  jet. The United States has estimated that 314 Panamanian soldiers and 202 civilians died during the operation.\n\nMr. Maduro also enjoys a “highly skilled” inner ring of protection, Mr. Abrams said, with an elite force of bodyguards supplied by his close political allies in nearby Cuba.\n\nMr. Maduro, in other words, would be unlikely to be found hiding out in a Dairy Queen.\n\nBut like Mr. Maduro, Mr. Noriega was also defiant to the end. In April 1988, he thrilled a crowd when he concluded a fiery anti-U.S. speech by smashing a podium with his machete.\n\n“This machete represents the dignity and courage of the Panamanian people,” Mr. Noriega said. “It says, ‘not one step back.’”\n\nJust as Mr. Noriega rejected U.S. efforts to negotiate his exit from power, Mr. Maduro has similarly refused to step down, instead offering Mr. Trump a U.S. stake in his country’s mineral wealth.\n\nThe Venezuelan leader has also invoked the memory of 1989, weaving it into a larger narrative about his defiance of what he calls American imperialism.\n\nDuring a visit to Panama City in 2015, Mr. Maduro stopped to lay a wreath at a memorial to Panamanians killed in the U.S. invasion.\n\n“Never again a U.S. invasion in Latin America,” he declared.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/senate-government-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:35:17-05:00","title":"Senate Passes Bill to Reopen Government Amid Democratic Rift","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan spending bill on November 10, 2025, ending a 41-day government shutdown that had left hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and millions of Americans without access to food assistance or other vital services.

legislation on Monday night to end the nation’s longest government shutdown, after a critical splinter group of Democrats joined with Republicans and backed a spending package that omitted the chief concession their party had spent weeks demanding.\n\nThe 60-to-40 vote, on Day 41 of the shutdown, signaled a break in the gridlock that has shuttered the government for weeks, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed, millions of Americans at risk of losing food assistance and millions more facing air-travel disruptions.\n\nThe measure goes next to the House, which is expected to take it up no sooner than Wednesday and where the small Republican margin of control and intense Democratic opposition could make for a close vote. President Trump has indicated that he will sign it.\n\nThe breakthrough came after eight senators in the Democratic caucus broke their own party’s blockade of spending legislation Republicans have been trying to pass for weeks to reopen the government, prompting a bitter backlash in their ranks.\n\nThey said they had done so after concluding that Republicans were never going to accede to Democrats’ central demand in the shutdown fight — the extension of federal health care subsidies set to expire at the end of the year — while millions of Americans continued to suffer amid the federal closure.\n\n“We had no path forward on health care because the Republicans said, ‘We will not talk about health care with the government shut down,’” said Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. “And we had SNAP beneficiaries and those relying on other important services who were losing benefits because of the shutdown.”\n\nIt will still take days to reopen the government. Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday urged House members — who have not held a vote in nearly two months as they took an extended recess during the shutdown — to begin the process of returning to Washington “right now.”\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Trump said that he approved of the plan.\n\n“We’ll be opening up our country very quickly,” he said, calling the package “very good.”\n\nWhile the legislation omits any mention of the tax credits, Democrats said they would accept an offer by Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, to hold a vote on the issue later this year, when the subsidies are set to expire.\n\nBut that measure, which would require 60 votes to pass, faces long odds in the Republican-controlled Senate and even less chance of advancing in the House, where Mr. Johnson would be unlikely to bring it up amid widespread opposition in his party.\n\nMany Democrats, including a phalanx of senators across the ideological spectrum, called that commitment woefully insufficient and angrily denounced the spending deal.\n\nAfter holding his party together for 40 days in the shutdown fight, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, opposed the deal made by some of his own members because, he said on Monday, “it fails to do anything of substance to fix America’s health care crisis.”\n\nOthers argued the agreement amounted to enabling Mr. Trump’s agenda and tactics, when Democrats should instead be standing up to him and Republicans.\n\n“Trump and MAGA Republicans have been shutting down the government since Inauguration Day, gutting Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and engaging in the greatest health care heist in history — all to pay for tax cuts for CEO billionaires,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. “The American people want us to stop the heist, not drive the getaway car.”\n\nThe compromise measure, which was largely negotiated by leaders on the Senate Appropriations Committee, includes a spending package that would fund the government through January, as well as three separate spending bills to cover programs related to agriculture, military construction and legislative agencies for most of 2026.\n\nThe package also includes a provision that would reverse layoffs of federal workers made during the shutdown and ensure retroactive pay for those who have been furloughed.\n\nMr. Trump, who has repeatedly defied Congress’s dictates on spending matters, said on Monday that he would comply with those provisions.\n\n“I’ll abide by the deal,” he said.\n\nAs many as a dozen Democrats, many centrists hailing from purple states who had been uncomfortable with the idea of backing a government shutdown, had been quietly huddling for weeks in search of an off-ramp. Several privately agreed to hold the party line until at least Nov. 1, the start date for the annual open enrollment period for people who receive health coverage through the federal marketplace, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.\n\nBut as the impact of the shutdown worsened and radiated across the nation, with flight cancellations racking up ahead of Thanksgiving travel and rising uncertainty around accessibility to food stamps, moderate Democrats were ready to break from their party. In the end, the eight who did were all senators who could afford to take a political hit; two are retiring while the other six are not up for re-election next year.\n\n“The question was, does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?” said Senator Angus King, an independent of Maine who caucuses with Democrats and voted for the deal. “Our judgment was that it will not produce that result. And the evidence for that is almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen. Would it change in a week or another week or after Thanksgiving or Christmas? And there’s no evidence that it would.”\n\n“What there is evidence of,” Mr. King added, “is the harm that the shutdown is doing to the country.”\n\nIn a 53-to-47 party-line vote, Republicans defeated a last-ditch effort by Democrats on Monday night to try to add a proposal to the spending package that would extend the credits for one year.\n\nBut the fight is far from over. Having succeeded in elevating the health care subsidies as a political issue during the shutdown, Democrats are eager to keep the pressure on Republicans to extend them or suffer the consequences from voters who polls show overwhelmingly want to see them protected.\n\nAlso rejected on Monday on a party-line vote was a Democratic effort to add a provision to bar the White House from using a maneuver known as a “pocket rescission,” in which the administration seeks to unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress by making the request so late in the fiscal year that lawmakers do not have time to reject it before the funding expires. The Trump administration used that maneuver earlier this year to cancel $4.9 billion Congress had approved for foreign aid programs.\n\nSenators also defeated an effort by Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, to remove language from the bill that would effectively ban the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-derived products. It was rejected on a bipartisan vote of 76 to 26, allowing the ban to stand.\n\nAlso tucked into the legislation was a provision that would provide a wide legal avenue for Republican senators whose phone records were seized as part of the investigation by Jack Smith, the former special counsel, into the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to sue the government for at least half a million dollars each.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ngrydkj3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:14:38.828+00:00","title":"Dame Jilly Cooper's death caused by head injury, says coroner","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dame Jilly Cooper, an 88-year-old renowned author known for her steamy romantic novels such as 'Riders', 'Rivals', and 'Polo', died from a traumatic head injury sustained during an unwitnessed fall at her home in Bisley, Gloucestershire, on 4 October.

reached a conclusion of accidental death and said Dame Jilly, 88, died as a result of a traumatic subdural haematoma.\n\nMs Skerrett said Dame Jilly had been unable to give an account of what had happened, but it was believed she had fallen down a flight of stairs \"as there was a trail of blood\" in that area of her home.\n\nAn urgent CT scan revealed she had sustained a skull fracture.\n\n\"The medical opinion was that this head injury was unfortunately catastrophic and therefore likely a terminal event,\" Ms Skerrett added.\n\n\"She was made comfortable, her condition

She said she was a health care worker and had just finished a 12-hour overnight shift. The word she used for how she felt about the state of the world was “concerned,” but she yelled it so hard into the bullhorn that the sound cracked and fried and the crowd winced.\n\n“We are people,” she shouted. “People.” The organizer reached for the bullhorn, indicating that the speaker’s time was up, but she was not finished with her litany of injustices: the children being killed and the other children being deprived of health care, and the cruel evisceration of social services that keep people alive — “and … and … and. … ” Suddenly she stalled out. After a brief stuttering pause, her eyes went wide, and she just screamed. The sound ripped across the square, making the crowd jump and then laugh in shock and recognition.\n\nEveryone seems to be screaming into the void these days. News items pop up about people who have gathered to scream — not in protest, just to scream — all over the country. In a new twist on service journalism, The Los Angeles Times ran a guide to the best screaming spots in the city; similar guides exist for Boston, Seattle, Denver, San Antonio and Grand Rapids, Mich. Even Backpacker magazine recognized demand, running a listicle of “6 Great Voids to Scream Into This Election Season.”\n\nDuring her recent tour, Olivia Rodrigo led audiences in group screams. Florence + the Machine’s newly released album reads like an instruction: “Everybody Scream.” People are delighted to oblige. Online certainly — there are so many memes I don’t know where to begin — but in the flesh, too. Last fall, a group of students at a Maine liberal-arts college stood on the steps of the college art museum, took a huge collective breath and screamed up into the sky. In May, student protesters at Columbia University gathered outside the residence of the university president to scream their displeasure. Scream clubs hosting free, informal group screaming in public places have formed in cities all over the United States.\n\nThere’s even a website designed for this purpose, screamintothevoid.com, where users are instructed to “type your feelings here” and then hit a big red button that reads “SCREAM.” The button is positioned over an image of a dark, swirling vortex, and when you click it, whatever words you’ve typed seem to shrink and retreat, sucked further and further into the image of the vortex until they vanish. The image reminds me: Inherent in the metaphor “screaming into the void” is the strange feebleness of the gesture. No matter how much noise you make, your voice doesn’t produce the desired effect. Depending on the circumstances, screaming into the void is a gesture of perverse thrill — a huge feeling vented without consequences — or of despair. A message appears over the blank space where moments ago your feelings were, as if in congratulation: “Glad nobody read that!”\n\nI have taken to writing all of this down in a little journal I have labeled the “screaming notebook.” In it, I record whenever an interesting scream crosses my path in conversation or stray news items.

I’m in a Nightmare’: Inside the First Deportation Flight to Iran\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T05:01:48-05:00\n\nIn the hours before dawn one day in early October, Mehrdad Dalir found himself stranded at a bus station in Iran. He recalls feeling the heavy gaze of passers-by and shivering. He looked out of place, dressed in a prison outfit of sorts: gray sweatpants and sweatshirt, and a pair of blue plastic slippers.\n\nAbout two days earlier, U.S. immigration authorities had taken Mr. Dalir from a detention facility inside an airport in Alexandria, La., and forced him aboard a plane to Iran as part of an unusual mass deportation to a country with a poor human rights record that the United States had bombed earlier this year in an effort to set back its nuclear program.\n\nMr. Dalir, 34, says he was shackled and handcuffed, and not given the chance to change out of the prison clothes he had worn during his time in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention. Once in Iran, he made his way by metro and bus from Tehran’s international airport to his hometown, Mashhad, in northeast Iran.\n\nAfter borrowing a cellphone, Mr. Dalir delivered the news to family members still in Mashhad: The United States had sent him back to Iran. “Maman, come and get me,” he told his mother, and broke into a sob. A blue backpack contained all his belongings — a few clothing items, his passport, immigration cards, a cellphone with a dead battery and a $20 bill.\n\n“It feels like I’m in a nightmare,” Mr. Dalir said in a three-hour telephone interview from Iran.\n\nHe acknowledged he had entered the United States illegally in April but said he thought he would have a powerful case for asylum because he has been critical of Islamic Shariah law and a political activist. He didn’t expect to be sent back to Iran.\n\n“I did everything in my power to stop them, but the ICE officials didn’t care. They told me, ‘You are either getting on the plane on your own, or we will tie you and send you back.’”\n\nOn Sept. 29, the Trump administration deported a planeload of Iranians, including Mr. Dalir, to Iran after reaching an agreement with Tehran. The U.S.-chartered deportation flight was a first. In the past, Iranian deportees were placed individually on commercial flights to Iran. Organizing a plane to Tehran had taken months of negotiations between American and Iranian officials.\n\nFor decades, waves of Iranians fleeing persecution found protection in the United States, including many who were at first unauthorized but later gained asylum.\n\nBut President Trump has made mass deportation a cornerstone of his immigration policy and signed an executive order, which went into place on the first day of his administration, banning asylum for migrants who crossed the border illegally. The policy has since been partially blocked by a federal court. The Trump administration announced late last month that it was cutting the number of refugees that could enter the U.S. to a record low of 7,500.\n\nAnd while, historically, migrants from countries difficult to deport to, like Iran and Venezuela, have languished in detention or lived freely in the United States, the Trump administration is pushing countries from across the globe to take back their own migrants.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the 54 Iranians deported on the flight had a final order of removal or an order granting voluntary departure and they were all given due process. Ms. McLaughlin said among the Iranians deported were “terrorists, human smugglers and suspected foreign agents.”\n\nMs. McLaughlin said of the 54 Iranians deported on the flight, 23 had ties to terrorism, seven were on the terror watch list and five others were associated with human trafficking networks. She provided the name of one man convicted of having ties to terrorist groups and two others who she said had committed fraud by uploading false and altered photos.\n\n“The Trump administration remains committed to fulfilling the president’s promise to expeditiously, and with the highest standards, deport illegal aliens from the country, ” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.\n\nIran’s foreign ministry has said that more than 400 Iranians in the United States face deportation and that planning is underway for additional flights.\n\nMr. Dalir and at least eight other individuals fiercely resisted deportation, according to his and other deportees’ accounts. They repeatedly told American authorities that Iran would persecute them and that they feared for their lives. Among them were Christian converts, ethnic minorities and political dissidents.\n\nThis article is based on interviews with Mr. Dalir; another deportee who asked to be identified only by his initials, A.A., because he feared publishing his full name would lead to his arrest; members of each man’s family; U.S. lawyers representing some of the deportees; and three Iranians currently held in ICE detention who knew some of the passengers on the flight.\n\nNeither Mr. Dalir nor A.A. were among those named by Homeland Security for having ties to terrorism or having committed fraud.\n\nThe New York Times also obtained the government records of both Mr. Dalir and A.A. and corroborated their accounts of detention and deportation with the information in the files. The Times also reviewed written statements gathered by Mr. Dalir’s father from seven other individuals on the flight who said they had been forcibly deported.\n\nMs. McLaughlin said that Mr. Dalir and A.A. had entered the U.S. illegally — and were quickly ordered deported.  She said both men had been given the opportunity to make a case for their fears of removal from the United States. “Both men had due process, and all of their claims heard. They were found to not be valid and received final orders of removal,” said Ms. McLaughlin, who disputed some of Mr. Dalir’s account of his deportation to Iran.\n\nAlthough Iran did not take either man into custody upon their arrival, Mr. Dalir and A.A. say they still face serious danger there.\n\n“The current administration fails to prioritize deportees and ignores the grave risks to Iranians seeking asylum at our border,” said Ali Herischi, an immigration lawyer based in Washington, who represents A.A. and a woman Christian convert also deported on the flight. “Fleeing to the U.S. — seen as Iran’s enemy — puts them in peril of persecution back home.”\n\nMr. Dalir’s journey as a refugee began in 2014 when, he said, he fled Iran with his father and younger twin brothers for Turkey. Hassan Dalir, their now 60-year-old father, was a schoolteacher who said he had been jailed and tortured for criticizing Islam and the government. His sons were also political activists, and, the father said, security agents threatened him and his family with violence and death.\n\nIn Turkey, the Dalirs registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to find a legal pathway for settling in a safe country. The U.N.H.C.R. recognized all four of them as refugees and called them “protected,” in documents reviewed by The Times.\n\nBut a combination of bad timing and shifting policies toward refugees tore the family apart. The U.N.H.C.R. referred the father and twin brothers, who at the time were teenagers, for resettlement in the United States but not Mr. Dalir, without explaining why. His case was instead referred to the government of Turkey, which discourages immigration to the country from the region and denied his asylum request. Officials ordered him to leave Turkey.\n\nThe younger brothers resettled two years ago in Raleigh, N.C., where they currently live and work at a Walmart. Mr. Dalir’s father was cleared for resettlement in the United States too, according to documents reviewed by The Times, but because of the time such cases can take, new hurdles — including a pause on refugee admissions — blocked his relocation from Turkey where he has only temporary status.\n\n“Our life is a real tragedy, each one of us is broken. A family of six scattered in different places, and we can’t even go to see one another,” Mr. Dalir’s father said in an interview from Turkey. His wife and daughter remained in Iran, and the couple eventually divorced.\n\nAfter Turkey rejected the younger Mr. Dalir, he said, he escaped to Greece, but was arrested and sent back to Turkey. He then set his eyes on the southern U.S. border. After trekking from Brazil to the Darién Gap to Mexico, in April he crossed into California, where he turned himself in to border patrol.\n\nMr. Dalir was transferred multiple times, from state to state, to different detention facilities. Though immigration authorities conducted a phone interview with him to assess his case, his appeal for protection was denied, and he was ordered deported.\n\nIn May he was taken to the Los Angeles airport and handed a ticket for a commercial flight to Iran — the only way ICE was able to deport people to Iran at the time. He refused to board and was returned to a detention facility in San Diego.\n\nInside detention in June, he staged a hunger strike. His records note that he skipped nine consecutive meals. He says he agreed to end the strike after the head of the detention facility told him he would try to help if he agreed to eat.\n\nAt one point, he begged officials to give him a second chance and review his case just so he could survive, government records show.\n\nOver the next several months, Mr. Dalir’s lawyer and family frantically tried to get him another hearing. His brother Mehrzad Dalir, 28, corresponded with the office of one of his U.S. senators, Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, asking him to intervene.\n\nMr. Tillis’s office appeared sympathetic and engaged with the case and the family, according to correspondences and voice messages shared with The Times. Mr. Tillis’s office informed the family that it had followed up with U.N.H.C.R. and ICE, but ICE officials had refused to reconsider. Mr. Tillis’s office did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Dalir said he and other Iranian detainees held in Louisiana realized their deportation was imminent when a representative from Iran’s government, Abolfazl Mehrabadi, the director of Iran’s interest section in Washington, showed up at the detention facility to meet with them.\n\n“We worked with the Americans to facilitate the flight because our policy is that we don’t want a single Iranian citizen to suffer in detention,” Mr. Mehrabadi said in an interview. He said he had reassured the deportees that they would face no problems when they landed in Iran.\n\nThe flight was the next day.\n\nIn what he described as a last act of desperation, Mr. Dalir said he attempted suicide at the detention facility on the day of the flight. He cut his wrists with a shaving razor hidden in his sleeve. Authorities noticed the bleeding, he said, and rushed him to a clinic on site. He said he was then placed in solitary confinement until the plane was ready to take off.\n\nThe Homeland Security spokeswoman, Ms. McLaughlin, said that Mr. Dalir had not attempted suicide and had not been put in solitary confinement.\n\nMr. Dalir recalled panicking when the bus reached the tarmac at Alexandria’s airport and stopped at the foot of an airplane. He screamed, and, crying, he begged, “They will kill me in Iran. Please don’t send me back, please have mercy.”\n\nWhen he refused to get on the plane, he said, several agents carried him up the steps to the aircraft and to his seat.\n\nAccording to Mr. Dalir and the statements from other deportees, the departure was chaotic, and ICE agents were clashing with some individuals who refused to board. Ms. McLaughlin called accounts of violence by ICE agents “false.” Some deportees requested access to their belongings to discard documents — a Bible, a cross, proof of links to opposition groups — that could incriminate them in Iran.\n\nWhen A.A. arrived in a separate bus, he said he looked out the window and saw Mr. Dalir being dragged to the plane. He says he staged his own resistance by locking himself in the bus and tying his hands to the seats. A group of ICE agents broke the door and dragged him out.\n\n“You have to kill me first before sending me back,” A.A. who is part of an ethnic minority group in Iran, said he kept shouting.\n\nHis wife, Mina, gave birth two months ago in Tennessee to their first child — a son, whom A.A. has not yet met. She was pregnant when they crossed the border into the United States, and they were separated during detention. Mina, still wearing an ICE ankle bracelet, was released to the custody of a relative to give birth.\n\n“My husband would never, ever leave willingly, because more than anything in the world he wants to see his son, and he wants to stay alive for him,” Mina said in an interview. She added she has been told she too faces deportation.\n\nThe flight to Iran took nearly 50 hours, with stops in Puerto Rico, Cairo and Doha. All the deportees were shackled and handcuffed for the duration of the flight to Doha. The Department of Homeland Security said the use of restraints during deportation flights is a longstanding protocol and “an essential measure” for safety of both the detainees and the officers accompanying them.\n\nDuring the flight, A.A. said, he was shouting to others in Persian that they should collectively attempt a last act of resistance in Doha.\n\nThe plane landed at a remote military base where a second chartered plane, a Qatar Airlines aircraft, awaited them. Mr. Dalir, A.A. and about eight others staged a protest, laying down on the bus during the transfer. Qatari security agents radioed for more support forces and began beating the men and dragged them out of the bus, Mr. Dalir and A.A. said. Their shackles were removed but they remained in handcuffs until Tehran, they added.\n\n“They used electric tasers to pacify me, and when that didn’t work they put me and another guy in straight jackets and tied us to our seats,” A.A. said.\n\nThe government of Qatar said it would not provide a comment on the record, but a Qatari official with knowledge of the flight said Qatar did not receive any requests for asylum and the transfer of detainees was handled in full accordance with international human rights standards and internal security protocols.\n\nA lineup of government officials and security agents in plainclothes was waiting for the deportees when they landed in Tehran.\n\n“We were all so terrified, we didn’t know what they would do to us,” Mr. Dalir said. “Some of the agents were saying, ‘Welcome back to your home,’ it was surreal.”\n\nIranian officials handed them a two-page form that asked their names, local home address and phone numbers; the names and contact numbers of relatives in Iran; email addresses and WhatsApp numbers; the reason they left Iran; and a description of the route they took to enter the United States.\n\nMr. Dalir said he and a handful of others were taken to a room where security agents questioned them further. They were told to be on notice to report for more questioning, and since then, intelligence agents have called several returnees, including Mr. Dalir and AA, instructing them to report for interrogations.\n\nIran’s state television broadcast short interviews with several of the voluntary deportees. A man who said he was a nurse said he went to America to seek better economic opportunities. “I was happy from the moment they told me, ‘You will be deported.’ The suffering would end,” he said without providing his name.\n\nFearing arrest, A.A. fled Iran a day after arriving at the advice of his lawyer, Mr. Herischi. He walked across the border to a neighboring country with the help of smugglers and is now in hiding.\n\nSince returning, three of his fellow deportees, Mr. Dalir said, have had their passports confiscated and were told they were banned from leaving the country.\n\nMr. Dalir has been changing locations frequently. He said security agents have called his mother several times saying he should report for questioning to the local office of the intelligence wing of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, but that he has so far ignored them. He said he wants to leave Iran but is exhausted from being on the run.\n\n“Where would I even go?” he asked. “Which country would take me at this point?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/iraq-parliamentary-election-vote.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:01:09-05:00","title":"As Iraqis Vote for a Parliament, U.S. Presses to Rid Country of Iran’s Influence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iraq is preparing for parliamentary elections amid deep political tensions between U.S. and Iranian influence.

2025-11-11T00:01:09-05:00\n\nFrom rooftops to lampposts, campaign posters compete for every inch of Baghdad’s streets. There are pictures of politicians wearing hard hats and slogans vowing “strength and prosperity.”\n\nConcrete walls that once shielded buildings from car bombs now protect glitzy new apartment developments, promising cafes, gyms and spas.\n\nAfter a long U.S. occupation, years of sectarian bloodshed and a jihadist insurgency, Iraq has become an improbable haven of calm in the Middle East, at least relative to many other parts of the region. Safeguarding this hard-won peace is a top priority for Iraqis as parliamentary elections get underway on Tuesday.\n\n“The Iraqi people have reached a point where they can no longer tolerate conflict and wars and all these misadventures,” Mohammed al-Sudani, the prime minister, told The New York Times in an interview last week. “People want stability, security and development.”\n\nMore than 7,700 candidates from 114 party lists are competing for 329 seats. Once the results are in, there will be weeks, and possibly months, of negotiating for parties to forge a coalition with the largest share of seats, and then form a government.\n\nMr. al-Sudani, often credited for Iraq’s stability and a construction boom, heads an alliance of parties expected to win the most votes. But some of his former political allies have vowed to prevent him from forming a ruling coalition to gain a second term.\n\nAnd just below the surface of this election lurks the thorny question of whether and how Iraq can curb the considerable influence of its once powerful neighbor, Iran.\n\nThe U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 toppled the longtime dictator Saddam Hussein and ended government control by the country’s Sunni Muslim minority. Since then, Iraqi politics have been dominated by the Shiite Muslim majority.\n\nIraq has been stuck ever since in a tug of war between Washington and Tehran, the regional Shiite power.\n\nIn recent years, an array of powerful Iran-linked militias have been gaining political influence in Iraq.\n\nThese mostly Shiite groups were created in 2014 as part of the so-called Popular Mobilization Forces to fight the Islamic State, or ISIS, the jihadist Sunni force that seized large parts of the country and brutally targeted Iraqi Shiites. Some obtained military and financial backing from Iran.\n\nThe threat of ISIS has faded, but the Iran-backed militias have grown more powerful. Their leaders argue they have the right to retain weapons as long as U.S. forces remain in Iraq. And they have pushed Iraqi officials hard to expel American troops.\n\nMr. al-Sudani secured a commitment for a phased withdrawal of the roughly 1,300 U.S. forces still in Iraq by September 2026. But U.S. officials are already negotiating to maintain a presence in the country, saying it is needed to fight Islamic State remnants.\n\nIran’s regional power has dwindled in the past two years since its Palestinian ally, Hamas, led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The attack ignited a war with Israel that devastated Gaza and upended the Middle East geopolitical order.\n\nIsraeli forces killed the leadership of Iran’s top regional ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. Rebels in Syria toppled the Iran-backed Assad dictatorship. And Israel launched a brief war on Iran in June that drew in U.S. warplanes.\n\nIran’s prized network of allied militias around the Middle East, which call themselves the “axis of resistance,” unraveled quickly almost everywhere, except in Iraq.\n\nThere, an array of Iran-backed militias are not only still armed, their political wings control several government ministries — and through them, access to lucrative state contracts. Most of these groups have grown so rich from this process, Iraqi and Iranian officials say, they no longer need funding from Tehran.\n\nIn this election, almost every Iran-backed militia is running a parliamentary list.\n\nKataib Hezbollah, the most powerful of these militias and the closest to Iran, paraded horn-honking car convoys through the southern city of Kut to cap its electoral campaign on Saturday, its flags emblazoned with a fist clutching a rifle waving overhead.\n\nPresident Trump’s administration has signaled it may not tolerate the presence of such militias in the country much longer.\n\nLast month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned of an “urgency in disarming Iran-backed militias.” Mr. Trump’s newly appointed envoy to Iraq, Mark Savaya, doubled down on that idea in a message to Iraqis ahead of the voting.\n\n“The United States stands with Iraq as it moves forward: strong, independent, and free from foreign-backed militias,” he wrote on social media.\n\nIraqi politicians expect Mr. Savaya to not only demand a U.S.-friendly premier, but a cabinet free of parties aligned to the Iran-linked militias.\n\n“Just the announcement that Trump appointed a new envoy had every Iraqi official shaking,” said Ali al-Hamdani, a political campaign manager in Baghdad. “They know what comes next.”\n\nIran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Esmail Baghaei, criticized U.S. pressure on Iraq on Monday, condemning foreign interference in the elections “unacceptable.” Iraq’s foreign ministry responded by calling his comments “provocative,” and urged Tehran not to get involved in the country’s internal affairs.\n\nOn the streets of Baghdad, ousting Iraq’s ever more powerful and rich militias is something even Iraqis who describe themselves as anti-American support.\n\n“I don’t like or agree with the Americans on anything, except on this,” said Mahasan Ali, a retired kindergarten teacher in Baghdad.\n\nBut disentangling Iraqi politics from this web of militias will be a huge challenge for the country.\n\nMany militias have come at least nominally under control of the government over the years. But the hard-line groups closest to Iran — which Washington is now pushing to disarm — refuse to submit. They defend their role as part of “the axis of resistance,” fighting what they see as foreign interference in Iraq by America and others.\n\nMr. al-Sudani, who came to power with the help of some of these groups, has promoted himself as the man who can keep the militias in check. His critics say he did it by turbocharging the patronage system.\n\nIraq is one of the world’s top oil producers, and relatively high crude prices have helped fuel a boom in state-funded development projects, which militias have profited from.\n\nFor Tehran, Iraq is not just a critical economic lifeline to the outside world, but a matter of security. The countries share a nearly 1,000-mile border and once fought a devastating eight-year war Iran is determined never to repeat.\n\n“Iraq represents one of the national security pillars for Iran, so Iran will fight to maintain control in Iraq,” said Ihsan al-Shammari, a political scientist at Baghdad University.\n\nHe sees a danger in keeping the militia-linked parties inside the government.\n\nPrime Minister al-Sudani disagrees.\n\n“Any path that can shift these militant factions to politics or economics, and then lay down their weapons — this is a good solution,” he told the Times.\n\nThe militias, however, insist they are not giving up their weapons.\n\nThree nights before the election, Jaafar al-Husseini, the military spokesman of the Iran-linked Kataib Hezbollah militia, gave a fiery and sectarian speech at a campaign rally.\n\n“Iraq is under full Shiite guardianship, whether they like it or not, and our weapons will remain in our hands,” he said.\n\nMohammed al-Tamimi, head of the group al-Waad al-Sadeq, said in an interview that the move to politics was not to surrender its arms, but to protect its interests.\n\n“Every faction needs men in the Parliament and government to safeguard their ambitions and their people’s demands,” he said.\n\nMr. al-Sudani presents himself as the ideal candidate for balancing between Iranian and American interests.\n\nHe recently oversaw deals for Chevron and Exxon to develop oil fields in Iraq. In an apparent gesture to Mr. Trump, he wrote an essay in The New York Post promoting Iraq as an investment partner.\n\nHe told the Times he would bring 50 Iraqi billionaires to Washington next month for an “Invest in America” conference, to show “harmony with President Trump’s course.”\n\nAll of the political jockeying has disillusioned many Iraqis.\n\nSome polls predict the lowest turnout ever in this 20-year-old democracy.\n\n“Why should we vote? It’s just a rotating door of new names representing the same powers,” said Mohammed Abbas, a 20-year-old mattress salesman on a Baghdad highway. “Our elections are completely performative.”\n\nFalih Hassan contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/nyregion/manhattan-doctor-anointment-extradition-japan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:49:35-05:00","title":"Accused of Desecration, a Doctor Faces the End of His Life’s Work","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Masahide Kanayama, a renowned U.S. physician specializing in endometriosis, is facing extradition to Japan for allegedly vandalizing religious sites by anointing wooden pillars and shrine structures with oil.

Life’s Work\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T07:49:35-05:00\n\nOne day in March 2015, surveillance cameras at a thousand-year-old Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Tokyo captured a man wearing a hooded windbreaker, a white collared shirt and black shoes, dabbing at wooden pillars with oil on his fingertip.\n\nLess than an hour later and 17 miles away, Japanese authorities said, a man with a similar build and clothing was caught on video anointing an offerings box at another site, a Shinto shrine founded in 643 B.C. during the reign of Japan’s first emperor.\n\nThe faiths predate Christianity by centuries, and the sites draw 12 million pilgrims and tourists each year. They venerate the Buddha and the Shinto kami, the spirits that the faithful believe animate natural forces and inhabit the land. The smears of oil, as the authorities saw them, despoiled Japan’s religious heritage.\n\nThe authorities found their suspect in New York, roughly 7,000 miles away, and issued arrest warrants for him on two counts of vandalism.\n\nHe is Masahide Kanayama, 63, a single, childless doctor who had devoted his life to helping women bear children; a man whose Christian faith was inseparable from his work. He has practiced in Manhattan for nearly three decades and is an expert in endometriosis, a condition in which cells similar to the uterine lining grow outside the uterus. His patients describe how his surgeries ended years of crippling pain and, in some cases, allowed them to have children.\n\n“I believe the Holy Spirit works through me by giving me an ability to perform my unique surgical technique,” Dr. Kanayama said. “When guided by faith, medicine becomes a way to serve God by serving others. My goal is to let God’s love be reflected through my actions and services.”\n\nNow, a decade after the hooded man was seen at the holy sites, that work may soon become impossible. The Japanese authorities say they found YouTube videos from 2012 in which Dr. Kanayama discussed anointing shrines with oil for religious purposes. They are seeking to bring him back to Japan for trial.\n\nDr. Kanayama’s lawyers said in a statement that he did not damage any sites, and added that “even if true, his actions damaged nothing.”\n\nHis lawyers have gone to federal court seeking to block the extradition, arguing that there is insufficient evidence to charge him. They have also asked the State Department, which has the final say on extraditions, not to approve this one.\n\nThe State Department recently told Dr. Kanayama’s lawyers they had denied the request, but U.S. officials agreed to delay any removal until Dr. Kanayama’s legal challenge is decided.\n\nA federal appeals court heard oral arguments last month and could issue a decision at any time. If the court rules against the doctor, he would face extradition to Japan, his native land, and prosecution.\n\nThe charges could bring five years of hard labor in a Japanese prison.\n\nOne Sunday morning in mid-October, Dr. Kanayama entered the Times Square Church on West 51st Street near Broadway. The nondenominational church, a former theater, welcomes thousands of worshipers in person and online to services that draw on the Pentecostal tradition. There is a live band and gospel singing, and congregants approach the pulpit seeking healing. He closed his eyes as he prayed, sang and swayed to the music.\n\nDr. Kanayama, whose ethnic Korean heritage already makes him an outlier in Japanese society, came to his faith at 17 when his mother took him to an evangelical missionary church in Tokyo. There, he had a spiritual awakening that he says led him to become a Christian and move to the United States.\n\n“I will show my healing power through your hands,” he said God had told him.\n\nHe attended Creighton University, a Jesuit school in Omaha, where in 1985 he graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in chemistry; and in 1991, he obtained his M.D. from the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nIn 1995, he completed four years as a resident at the Mayo Clinic’s medical school, and then moved to New York, where he worked for several years as a professor at the Mount Sinai medical school’s department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences. He also began practicing at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, where he performs his surgeries, using an excision technique that he developed.\n\nDr. Kanayama, a legal permanent resident of the United States, now runs the New York Endometriosis Center in Manhattan, which he says has drawn patients from around the world, including Japan. The office includes a meditation room lined with rice paper and bamboo flooring. Dr. Kanayama said he wanted to provide patients with an atmosphere of tranquillity and calm.\n\n“Healing is not only physical, but also mental, emotional and spiritual,” he said.\n\nJessie Lambiase, 34, a Westchester County resident who owns two fitness studios and a jewelry store, had long struggled with the pain and fatigue of endometriosis. Doctor after doctor seemed dismissive. One suggested a therapist.\n\nShe said Dr. Kanayama had immediately recognized her condition and told her it wasn’t all in her head. She has undergone two surgeries with him, most recently this year.\n\n“He’s been the only doctor who has been able to help me,” she said. “Looking at a future where I still have this disease and he’s not here, and there’s really no other surgeon who does what he does — that’s terrifying.”\n\nMary Giuliani, a 50-year-old Manhattan writer and caterer, said she had seen a half-dozen doctors before Dr. Kanayama’s surgery finally relieved her pain in 2022.\n\nShe said that if he were extradited, the effect on patients would be dire, as so many could miss out on a life without pain or the ability to create a family.\n\n“It’s only him,” she said. “There’s nowhere else to go.”\n\nDr. Kanayama’s schedule, his lawyers said, is booked months in advance, with patients from all over the world. He has told few of his patients of his legal predicament, and says he finds a haven in church, a respite from the long surgeries he performs during the week and the stress of his case.\n\nThroughout much of the two-hour service that day at the Times Square Church, Dr. Kanayama stood in the packed rows, his left hand gripping a Japanese-language Bible and his right arm raised in the air.\n\nHe often carries that Bible, with its dog-eared pages and underlined verses. “I underline everywhere,” he said.\n\nHe has loved going to other churches as well. Years ago, he created a nonprofit called International Marketplace Ministry and traveled to Europe, South Korea, Japan and around the United States. He spoke to church groups and to businesspeople about living spiritual lives, not just in church but also in the workplace.\n\n“I’m just a doctor,” he said. “But I know the Lord. I know God. I know how to communicate, so I just share my experience and I encourage people.”\n\nAdherents of his strain of marketplace Christianity strive to marry their faith and their vocation, following the model of John the Baptist, who preached to tax collectors and soldiers. They believe that work life and spiritual life must be one.\n\nDr. Kanayama said he ended the trips and his nonprofit activities in 2015, after the Japanese authorities charged him.\n\n“Anointing” appears throughout the Bible as a sacred practice. The oil, smeared, rubbed or poured, is a symbol that God has chosen a person or object for a holy purpose. It is used to sanctify physical spaces: In the book of Exodus, God tells Moses, “Thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.”\n\nAt the ancient Naritasan Shinsho-ji Temple in the city of Narita, the Japanese authorities said Dr. Kanayama had left oil on pillars that were part of the main gate used to enter the sanctuary.\n\nThe gate was built in a traditional Japanese architectural style and is itself an object of worship, a temple official said in a declaration filed with the court. The oil had left blackish stains, the official wrote.\n\nAt the Katori Jingu Shrine in nearby Katori, oily liquid was left on wooden poles on both sides of the front stairs, on the stairs themselves and on the box where worshipers can make donations, a shrine official said in another declaration. The oil left stains, although over time they became almost invisible unless observed up close, the official said.\n\nThe Japanese authorities concluded that it was possible that one person committed both crimes in the 51 minutes that had elapsed between them. They also determined that the figure seen in the security footage at both sites resembled the driver of a gray Toyota Prius that was caught on an expressway tollgate camera around the same time.\n\nThe Prius’s license plate number led investigators to a car rental agency at a nearby airport, where Dr. Kanayama’s name was found in the rental records. Flight records showed he had traveled to Japan from New York a few days earlier.\n\nDr. Kanayama said he had been targeted because he was a Christian in a country where members of the faith had suffered repression for hundreds of years and today represent only about 1 percent of the population.\n\n“This is a religious persecution,” Mr. Kanayama’s lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said. “Why else would they be so enthusiastic about destroying not only this man’s life, but ending his ability to help thousands of women who suffer from a very serious medical malady?”\n\nThe Japanese consulate in New York did not have any immediate comment on the case.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2022, Dr. Kanayama sat with his lawyers in a federal courtroom in Lower Manhattan as an American prosecutor argued that Japan’s extradition request should be honored. If the judge agreed, the question of whether to hand him over to Japan would be up to the U.S. secretary of state.\n\nThe prosecutor, Tara La Morte, said the standard for sending Dr. Kanayama back to Japan had been met. For one thing, as the mutual extradition treaty required, there was a crime in New York — criminal mischief — that was equivalent to the offense Dr. Kanayama faced in Japan. And the evidence had shown there was probable cause to believe that he had damaged the sites.\n\nShe pointed to the 2012 YouTube videos of a man Japanese officials said was Dr. Kanayama talking about pouring oil on shrines.\n\n“This is evidence, your honor, of intent and motivation,” Ms. La Morte said.\n\nDr. Kanayama’s lawyers dispute whether Dr. Kanayama is clearly shown in the videos, and say that his comments about pouring oil on shrines were translated incorrectly. In court, Mr. Lichtman did not concede that his client had been present at the sites or had left any oil on them. But if he had, Mr. Lichtman said, the purpose had not been vandalism.\n\n“There was never any intent here for him to damage anything,” Mr. Lichtman said. “He was there to purify.”\n\nMs. La Morte noted that the case was of particular significance to Japan because of other incidents in which historical sites had been vandalized.\n\n“It’s important to Japan to figure out why it’s happening and who is doing it,” Ms. La Morte said.\n\nMr. Lichtman suggested that Japan’s motives were less benign. “This is a political case,” he said, citing what he called the relative insignificance of the allegations against his client weighed against the fact he is “a world-renowned OB-GYN” who had “helped thousands of women globally.”\n\n“It’s our position that this is a grotesque abuse of the extradition treaty,” he said.\n\nIn January 2023, the judge, Edgardo Ramos, ruled that Dr. Kanayama could be extradited; a second judge, who was asked to review the case, concurred. Dr. Kanayama’s appeal is pending.\n\nDr. Kanayama’s recent visit to the Times Square Church came days after the State Department had denied his lawyers’ request to stop his extradition on legal and humanitarian grounds.\n\nAfterward, on a bench outside, he turned the pages of his Bible to a passage from the Book of Micah he had underlined. He said its message was that God asks three things: Do justice, love mercy and humbly walk together with him.\n\nDuring the service, the pastor had referred to people enduring hard times, people who were broken.\n\n“I’m totally broken right now,” Dr. Kanayama said. “But I’m still alive,” he added. “They’re not crushing my spirit.”\n\nThe pastor, apparently alluding to a popular Christian song, had also said of God, “There’s no wall you won’t pull down, no lie you won’t tear down.”\n\n“I think that statement is coming to answer my prayer,” he said.\n\nSusan C. Beachy and Georgia Gee contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/books/sarah-jessica-parker-booker-prize.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"08:55:09-05:00","title":"Sarah Jessica Parker’s Year of Judging the Booker Prize","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sarah Jessica Parker, best known as an actress, has served as a judge for the prestigious Booker Prize, marking a significant shift into literary evaluation.

Prize\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T08:55:09-05:00\n\nThree years ago, Sarah Jessica Parker posted a plea on the Booker Prize’s Instagram page. She wanted to judge the prestigious award. “Oh let me try!!!!” she said.\n\nNow, the actor and publisher has done just that. On Monday night in London, Parker pushed herself out of her seat to get a clear view as David Szalay, the author of the winning novel “Flesh,” rushed onstage to collect the Booker Prize.\n\nParker said she and her fellow judges had chosen the novel, a rags-to-riches tale of a taciturn Hungarian teenager who rises to heights of British society, after a five-hour-plus meeting in London. “Flesh” was “singular, exciting, propulsive, emotional,” she said, sounding almost gleeful.\n\nWinning the Booker Prize is a life-changing experience for an author. Sales blow up. Demands for interviews pour in. But Parker, who oversees a literary imprint at Zando, said that being a judge was just as life-changing. The process altered her reading habits, she said, made her question how she judged fiction and gave her the confidence to argue for novels she loved.\n\nNow that it’s over, she’ll be able to once again take part in movie nights, theater trips and family dinners with her husband, Matthew Broderick, and their children. And the five judges have formed a book group so they could keep reading together, Parker said.\n\nBut she is sad, too. “I was looking up Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s stages of loss, and they’re denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance,” she added. “I can’t figure out where I am, but I’m not at acceptance, I can tell you that much.”\n\nIt was the “experience of a lifetime,” Parker said repeatedly during four interviews this past year tracking her time judging the award. Here are edited excerpts from the interviews. — Alex Marshall\n\nWe were in rural Ireland for a Christmas holiday and I was on my way to SuperValu, our local market, when I saw a friend going the other way, and knew in the back of their car was this box from Booker with the first 16 titles.\n\nI rushed back and opened the box with my husband and I couldn’t believe some of the authors. These were familiar names. For a reader as greedy as I am, it felt like winning the lottery.\n\nImmediately, I started reading. I know exactly where I was sitting. I remember my family leaving, coming back, leaving, coming back. Days might have passed!\n\n“Flesh” was in there. “The Land in Winter,” that was too. I remember reaching out to Gaby, the Booker Prize’s organizer, and saying, “Have you read ‘The Land in Winter’ yet? This book is really special. It’s so atmospheric and it has a kind of elegance to it.”\n\nMy husband and children knew what this meant. No one tried to compete with the Booker. Anytime after dinner, when there was a discussion about what movie to watch, no one asked me. Everybody knew what I would be doing. My husband soon stopped asking if I wanted to see this play or that musical or this show Off Broadway.\n\nI was able to be there for the necessary, but if I was at a volleyball game, I sure as hell had a book on my lap, which I was also very nervous about doing because I didn’t want anyone to see what I was reading.\n\nI was hypervigilant about that. I took all the covers off.\n\nI mainly read in this room in our New York home that I call my office, but it’s more like a depository: Everything goes into that room, including conversations, and there’s chairs but everybody sits on the floor.\n\nMy family would walk by — I’d keep the door open as it was too lonely to close — and probably by March they would hear this sound: my finger on the page, moving through paragraphs. My fingers started guiding me. It was really unplanned. I don’t know where that came from.\n\nIt was lonely, which gave me some insight into what it must be to be a writer, which I always assumed was a solitary affair. And because we were reading in such volume and there was such an intensity to the reading, I couldn’t listen to any music that I normally would: Nothing that might provoke singing along. So I started listening to music that I didn’t know at all: Tibetan music, Ukrainian music, Nigerian music, Kenyan music, old ’60s Cuban music. And it was really cool and exciting and changed the entire tone of the room. It created a buoyancy around the whole thing.\n\nI never understood a spreadsheet before judging the Booker, and I never cared to learn, but we used them so much.\n\nAbout 24 to 48 hours before deliberations, we’d send in traffic light ratings for each book we’d read. Red was for books we felt shouldn’t move forward, amber was for books we believed worthy of discussion, and green for books that we felt were immediately deserving.\n\nAnd the first time I did that this, I was absolutely terrified. I spent enormous amounts of time trying to understand my own criteria.\n\nI was quite generous with the greens.\n\nAt our first meeting, I was so scared about talking about books with the other judges. These were Booker winners, long- or shortlisted authors, or people like Chris Power — professionals who spend their time critiquing, thinking and writing about books.\n\nBut we discussed David Szalay’s “Flesh,” and after that first conversation I felt so much more comfortable. It wasn’t intimidating. I didn’t feel like I was defending my thesis. The theoretical, like many things in life, is much more scary than opening your mouth, and if someone disagrees with you, it doesn’t mean you’re wrong.\n\nThere was a month when I think we had to read, like, 34 books and the math wasn’t, as they say, mathing.\n\nIt was a particularly busy time because I was doing press for “And Just Like That …” so I’d have a book on my lap during these press junkets, and it was bananas because there was no way I was going to read between one interviewer standing up to leave and someone new walking in. The gap was maybe eight seconds!\n\nSo I didn’t get any reading done for four or five days, and I was really panicked because the last thing I wanted to do was rush books. So I just didn’t sleep.\n\nFor me as a reader, the idea of not finishing a book, I just really, really struggle with. But with the Booker, you sort of have to adopt a brutality, because if you’re on Page 110 and you’re waiting for the book to rise ….\n\nOccasionally when I would be reading something, I would reach out to Roddy [Doyle, the judging panel chairman] and say, “Have you touched on this book yet? Here are my feelings about it, but it’s possible I’m spot-on wrong.” And he would write back on WhatsApp and say, “You’re not, I just put that book down, too.”\n\nBut I ended up picking everything back up, because I was so afraid: What if we got into a discussion, and Kiley [Reid] or one of the other judges felt really strongly that it was exciting, and I hadn’t read the entire book? I wouldn’t be able to talk about it!\n\nIt scared me too much not to complete.\n\nOur second meeting was on Zoom. I pushed for two books by debut authors and neither made the list.\n\nI felt, in retrospect, I wasn’t prepared as I could have been.\n\nWhat became really important for me was to remember the ways in which my fellow jurors looked at books and the things they might object to. In some instances, they were factually spot on: Dates are wrong, regions are wrong, politics in a time and a place are not accurately portrayed. My argument would then be, is that purposeful?\n\nBut that discussion wasn’t an indictment. No one was attacking me and saying, “You’re wrong.” They were just disagreeing for reasons that were as valid to them as mine were that the books were beautiful. It was really good for me.\n\nCreating the longlist was absolute agony. AG-ON-Y!  I can’t tell you how many times I looked around that table and saw people with their heads in their hands.\n\nOne hundred and fifty-three books and we had to choose 13. It’s just … impossible.\n\nWe met at 10:30 a.m. in a room in Fortnum & Mason in London and finished at 5 p.m. It was the final two books that were difficult. We had one list and were 3-2 in favor of the books I wanted. Then someone needed to use the bathroom. We took a quick five-minute break and something in me said, “This list is going to change,” and a juror came back and said, “I’ve changed my mind.”\n\nOh my God, no! I knew it. We should have locked everybody down: “No bathroom breaks! Nobody touch any liquids!”\n\nThere’s so many books that I’m heartbroken are not on the list, but there’s nothing you can do. You’ve made your best arguments, you’ve thrown yourself in front of the court.\n\nOn July 14, we finished the longlist deliberation. Then on July 15, I went to Ireland where I was going to meet my family and thought, “Oh, I have a little break from the Booker. I’m going to read a book outside of this chapter of my life.”\n\nAnd I had brought “Skippy Dies” by Paul Murray, and started it on the plane. Then, two days later, all the longlisted books arrived. So my daughter took “Skippy Dies” and fell madly in love with it, which was wonderful to see, and I was gone again from the outside world.\n\nI never reread books. The only books I’ve ever reread are “Franny and Zooey” and “Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters,” and that’s because I first read them so young.\n\nBut now, I would be on the side of rereading because doing it to choose the shortlist was a huge lesson. I had such a different experience with these books. Sometimes it was as if someone finally took me out of a dark room. I was like, “Oh! I’m discovering new things.”\n\nI think that’s because when we were reading the first time, the volume was so intense, we needed to read so rapidly. But with the shortlisting, we actually had time. I slowed down. I made notes. I thought about things I didn’t recognize the first time, like form, or structure, or even words, these wonderful and surprising choices.\n\nLiterally like three days before the shortlist deliberations, Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ,̀ my fellow juror, had a baby! So the next group of jurors really should know it’s a full term.\n\nBefore the shortlist meeting, we were all feeling this joyful anxiety. Everybody was talking in advance in our WhatsApp group — “Counting down! Can’t wait!” — trying to get some information from each other, but also not really wanting any because it’s a cliffhanger.\n\nWe were doing the shortlist meeting on Zoom and I was in New York in my office, sitting there waiting. And I had my stack ready — the six books I wanted to choose — but I moved it out of the lens because I didn’t want to set the table for a conversation that shouldn’t yet be had.\n\nAnd it was five hours, but it was so wonderful. Books came, they went, they were there, they weren’t. You’d think a book would have this robust support and then you found people talking about it differently than they had before.\n\nIt was so hard to lose books. And we all lost books. There was a real sense of grief. But then Roddy said, “This is it. These are the six books. Are we sure?”And I felt really good. I looked at them and thought, “I think we’ve done our job.”\n\nThis is the kind of writing we should be celebrating, and these are the kinds of authors we should be announcing to the world.\n\nThere was a party after we announced the shortlist and it was great: I got to meet Benjamin Wood, Ben Markovits and Andrew Miller. I don’t know that I would have been bold enough to just walk up to them and introduce myself, but luckily their agents found me.\n\nI thought I might not have this occasion again, so I wanted to tell them just what these books meant to us. With Ben Markovits, I was quoting some of his lines back to him, which was so juvenile of me. Later on, I said to myself, “I cannot believe you said to him, ‘You remember?’” Who wouldn’t remember a line that they had written!\n\nWhen we finished the shortlist, I started reading other books again that day, because I had so many manuscripts for my imprint that were urgent because the books were going to auction.\n\nI found I’m far harder on books now. I expect more, and I know it can be achieved because I’ve just read 153 books and a lot of them were great.\n\nI think that’s good for me, because I have such a sentimental streak about writers. I have so much admiration for them.\n\nWe met on Saturday. And before, I was feeling incredibly excited. I had no certainty about where we might land. There hadn’t been a lot of texting between us judges and I wondered if that was because the others were experiencing what I was: one day thinking you’d arrived at a winner, and moments later talking yourself out of that book.\n\nWe talked for over five hours. The first part was just discussing the virtues of each book again: Why was this book here? What did we discover rereading them? Nothing negative allowed.\n\nThen, we put them in order until Roddy said, “We have a winner.” And I was like, “Oh! We do?” For some reason, in all my pondering, I had never thought of him saying those words.\n\nAnd we sat for a second, then thought, “Gosh, we’re really proud of this.”\n\nI’m already reading again. I’ve just read “This Is Where the Serpent Lives,” coming out next year. And I finished the new Patrick Radden Keefe book. But the other day, my husband, daughter and I, we were on a train visiting colleges and I felt them exchange looks because I was doing that thing with my finger where I move it along the page to read fast. And I realized, “Oh my God, I don’t have to do this anymore. I don’t have to read like that. I can actually slow down.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/islamabad-bomb-blast-live-12-dead-in-pakistan-capital-in-suicide-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"09:52:54Z","title":"Updates: Pakistan blames India for deadly Islamabad bomb blast","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has accused India of being responsible for a deadly bomb blast in Islamabad, its capital city.

He had done this a couple of hundred times, but the nerves never failed to flare.\n\n“I think they’re getting ready,” Burford said shortly afterward, walking to his place beside a readied grave in a 198-year-old cemetery.\n\nAs a few dozen mourners watched, a member of the Air Force approached the casket of a 92-year-old veteran and saluted. Then Burford began to play taps, the solemn bugle call that since the 1800s has been used to herald the end of a day and, in this case, the end of a life.\n\nWhen his final note crescendoed to a finish, it left a chasm of silence.\n\nIt was not a perfect rendition — “a little pitchy,” Burford said later, with a quarter note that cracked near the end. But it was unique in a way that some find vastly superior to the alternative.\n\nIf Burford had not driven 115 miles to the cemetery, a recording would have been played instead from a speaker that fits into the bell of a bugle. The device allows taps to be played at every funeral with military honors, as is legally required, but it has also stirred a resistance.\n\nBurford is one of at least 2,500 volunteers who travel to play taps at military funerals, many distressed by the idea of a recording performing the duties. They are tweens and nonagenarians, civilians and veterans. Some are seasoned musicians with an in-demand skill. Others are lapsed players who felt compelled to restart.\n\n“It’s not like I don’t like the recording,” Burford, a 49-year-old adjunct professor who teaches classic literature at Samford University, said a few weeks before the funeral in Columbus, Miss. “I just feel like our veterans and our soldiers deserve better.”\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2000, most veterans have been eligible to receive funeral honors that guarantee a two-person military honor detail; the folding of a U.S. flag and its presentation to the next of kin; and a rendition of taps, which can come from a recording in the absence of a bugler.\n\nThat initially included tapes and CDs played through a boombox. But in 2003 — when there were about 1,800 veteran deaths each day and only 500 military buglers — the military greenlit an electronics-augmented bugle.\n\n“We wanted to try and keep it as realistic as possible,” said Simon Britton, who developed that technology, which is known as the Ceremonial Bugle and plays a 1999 recording from Arlington National Cemetery. He estimated that 15,000 to 20,000 have been sold.\n\nBritton said he had received “a lot of flak from real bugle players” over the years. Musicians complain that digital bugles are deceptive and vulnerable to dying batteries and human error, like cuing the wrong tune. Some dislike their sound. Others say they sound too good.\n\nSo with demand outrunning supply, local musicians have been volunteering to play taps. Some come from two nationwide nonprofits matching horn players with the need: Bugles Across America, which contributed to more than 5,000 military funerals or ceremonial events last year, and Taps for Veterans, which served more than 700 events.\n\nWhile the military said current figures were not immediately available because of the government shutdown, in 2022 an official estimated that the Defense Department provided 260,000 funeral honors annually.\n\nLarry Schillings, the president of Bugles Across America, which was founded in 2000, had played taps as a teenager and through college after being recruited by his father, an Army National Guard officer who organized funeral honors in northern Wisconsin. He then set aside his instrument for 30 years until returning home for the funeral of his younger brother, a Vietnam War veteran.\n\n“That’s when I found out about the boombox,” said Schillings, 77, who lives in Morristown, N.J. After locating a musician for the funeral, he bought himself a trumpet. (Taps was historically played on the bugle, which has no valves, but is now commonly performed on a trumpet.)\n\nTaps for Veterans is led by Mark Paradis, 57, who founded the group in 2012 with the retired Air Force bugler Jari Villanueva, an expert on the history of taps.\n\nParadis, who lives in Harwich, Mass., played the trumpet from childhood through six years in the Marine Corps, picking it up again a decade later to help with Marine funerals and other events. “It just basically kind of blossomed into this whole other career of giving back and providing this gift of music,” he said.\n\nRequests for taps — often with only a day or two’s notice — come from family members of the deceased, funeral directors and even the military. First Sgt. Stephen Porter, who coordinates Marine funeral honors within a 50-mile radius of Picatinny Arsenal, near Dover, N.J., has no horn players at his command. So Bugles Across America covers taps for nearly every funeral under his purview.\n\n“Words cannot describe just how proud I am that I know them, and that they do this for the service members,” the sergeant said.\n\nThose who play taps say it can be intensely poignant, even when honoring a stranger. It is a straightforward climb up and down an octave, but laden with meaning in a way that can make each of its 24 notes a lump of emotional concentrate.\n\nAlong with expectant mourners and sometimes merciless weather, it becomes a high-pressure moment capable of turning a simple tune into an obstacle course.\n\n“There’s no reason to not think about every note like it’s a story, like you’re telling the story of this soldier,” said Aidan Peterson, a 19-year-old student at the Juilliard School in New York who volunteers for Bugles Across America.\n\nBeginning as a white-gloved 9-year-old at a Coast Guard veteran’s funeral, Peterson has played taps at about 650 funerals or events, he said. He has no connection to the military, but his mother nudged him to use his passions to benefit others.\n\n“Maybe it won’t change the world,” he said, “but it might change someone’s day.”\n\nDr. Lee Dodd, a retired psychiatrist in Guthrie, Okla., and a semiprofessional French horn player, learned to play the bugle so she could volunteer with Taps for Veterans.\n\n“It just broke my heart when I realized that they were using canned music,” said Dodd, 71, who spent a decade as a computer programmer and analyst for the Army.\n\nShe has fielded calls to perform taps in the furnace of summer and in wind chills of minus 22, using a plastic mouthpiece because she feared her lips would stick to the metal. This past summer she played in a backyard as a man transferred his father’s ashes from an old metal can to the earth under a walnut tree.\n\nIn four years of volunteering, Dodd’s mind-set has evolved from stressing over perfection into appreciation for the moment. She also increasingly feels an urgency to make sure that younger musicians know this opportunity exists.\n\n“You can’t force people to do this,” Dodd said. “They have to have it in their heart to do it, because it’s not about you. It’s not about a performance, it’s a tribute.”\n\nBurford, the professor, had wanted to serve in the military but never did. In taps he sees a perpetual second chance.\n\nA few weeks after the funeral in Mississippi, he was headed to the Alabama National Cemetery, near his home in Pelham, Ala. It was a cool, misty afternoon, and at this funeral of a 75-year-old Army veteran, taps was played after three rifle shots, a handshake of jarring and soothing sounds.\n\nTwenty-five years in, volunteering at first on his own and since 2022 for Bugles Across America, Burford is still unwrapping layers of meaning in the liturgical-like funeral process, and in the opportunity to show up with something authentic for strangers.\n\n“I never would have thought that the two things that I’m going to be buried with will be my Bible and my trumpet,” Burford said.\n\nSeveral minutes later, he had a change of heart about the instrument: “It’s not going to do anybody any good sitting in a coffin.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/utah-redistricting-gerrymander-congress.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:28:02-05:00","title":"Judge Rejects Utah’s Republican-Drawn Redistricting Map","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Utah judge, Dianna M.

Gibson, instead adopted a map offered by a centrist coalition that had filed a lawsuit challenging the Republican proposal.\n\nThe ruling is a victory for Democrats in the nationwide battle over redistricting, as President Trump has increasingly pressured state-level Republicans to redraw congressional maps in his party’s favor. Last week, California voters approved Proposition 50, which redrew that state’s congressional boundaries to favor Democrats in what was hailed as a major win for the party ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nDemocrats face an uphill battle in Utah, where they have not won a U.S. House seat since 2018. Still, the party’s state lawmakers welcomed Judge Gibson’s ruling.\n\n“We, the Utah House and Senate Democrats, feel a deep sense of hope and relief,” the state party said in a statement. “This is a win for every Utahn.”\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Utah Republicans vowed to fight the ruling, calling it an “Activist Map Decision.”\n\n“We will boldly, lawfully, and relentlessly work to restore constitutional government and protect Utahns’ right to self-govern,” the Republican caucus said in a post on X.\n\nStill, Deidre Henderson, a Republican and Utah’s lieutenant governor, said in a social media post that she would abide by Judge Gibson’s order and start establishing the boundaries of Map 1 for the 2026 midterm elections, for which the January filing deadlines are fast approaching.\n\nThe ruling comes three months after Judge Gibson ordered new maps to be drawn for Utah’s four congressional districts, saying the boundaries approved by the Republican-controlled State Assembly in 2021 violated the state constitution and were gerrymandered to favor them.\n\nA coalition of centrist groups filed a lawsuit in 2022, accusing Republican lawmakers of ignoring voter-approved safeguards when they redrew the boundaries the previous year.\n\nThat map divided Salt Lake City — the state’s biggest metropolis and an island of Democratic support — into four districts that each had a Republican majority. The map was used in the 2022 and 2024 election cycles.\n\nIn July, when Judge Gibson ordered new maps to be drawn, state officials imposed a deadline of Nov. 10, so that the new boundaries could be established in time for the midterms.\n\nThe Republican state legislature went on to adopt a new map in October. But that map, Judge Gibson said on Monday, still failed to uphold the state’s constitution. Instead, facing the deadline, she had to adopt one of the plaintiffs’ proposed maps.\n\n“The Court bears the unwelcome obligation to ensure that a lawful map is in place,” she wrote, saying she would accept the plaintiff’s “Map 1” as the standing congressional map for the state.\n\nThat map, which preserved the Democratic-leaning district surrounding Salt Lake City, “has neither the purpose nor effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring a political party,” Judge Gibson wrote. “It does not guarantee one-party control of the congressional delegation but rather accords with Utah’s natural political geography and electoral conditions.”\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee applauded the new congressional maps.\n\n“Every seat counts, and Democrats everywhere are fired up and ready to take back the House in the midterms in 2026,” the committee said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/books/review/unfettered-john-fetterman.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:01:04-05:00","title":"John Fetterman’s Memoir Is Unlike Any Politician’s Book You’ve Read","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Fetterman’s memoir, 'Unfettered,' stands out among political memoirs for its raw honesty about mental health, depression, and political disillusionment.

Read\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T00:01:04-05:00\n\nUNFETTERED, by John Fetterman\n\nOn a crowded shelf of memoirs by sitting politicians, John Fetterman’s new book has to be one of the strangest. The cover of “Unfettered” features a headshot of the Democratic senator from Pennsylvania as he frowns into the camera, his dark gray hoodie conspicuously speckled with debris. Inside the book, you’ll find none of the genre’s usual tropes: no can-do optimism, no affability, no evidence of a politician’s instinct to glad-hand for the next election.\n\nBut then it’s not entirely clear from “Unfettered” whether Fetterman, who has spoken openly about his mental health issues, plans to run for office again. Recalling the moment in November 2022 when he won an expensive Senate race against the celebrity surgeon-influencer Mehmet Oz, Fetterman, who had been hospitalized for a stroke a few months before, says he “felt nothing.” The next day he was in a “daze of doom.” Staring at a bridge, he contemplated suicide.\n\nFetterman has been a U.S. senator now for nearly three years, but he doesn’t appear to like his job all that much. A number of articles have noted his dismal attendance record. In his memoir, Fetterman, who on Sunday was one of seven Democrats (along with Angus King, an independent) to break with the party to vote to end the government shutdown, mostly speaks of the Senate with disdain. “There is no sanctity left in the present U.S. Congress,” he writes, before adding that virtually the only issue enjoying bipartisan support was the push to enforce a dress code on the Senate floor that was “aimed at me.” (Fetterman, determined to wear his hoodie and shorts to work, says he stood in the doorway to give a thumbs up or down on a given vote before returning to his office.)\n\nBesides, Fetterman’s career shows that there are political advantages to bucking convention. Bland, smiling figures who smoothly recite polished talking points are relics from a less furious era. Fetterman has two master’s degrees, including one from Harvard, and worked briefly in the insurance business. But as the mayor of Braddock, Pa., from 2006 to 2019, he developed a reputation as a populist folk hero, restoring some distressed infrastructure for community use and directing a local youth program. In his book, he laments the hollowing out of Rust Belt towns like Braddock. “Western Pennsylvania, once the epicenter of the greatest industrial outpouring the world had ever seen, was left to decay in our version of Pompeii, buried by greed and the arrogance of post-World War II thinking that no other country would ever catch up to us,” he writes.\n\nMost of “Unfettered” is unrelentingly dour and mournful. Despite having parents who “provided me with every comfort,” Fetterman identifies strongly with blue-collar workers who feel betrayed and forgotten. He recounts the many times he felt overwhelmed by shame and self-loathing: “I didn’t deserve anything except loneliness and sadness and isolation.” In 2023, he spent six weeks at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center being treated for his severe depression.\n\nHis memoir, which is dedicated to “anyone with depression,” includes extended quotations from staffers and family members who implored him to obtain medical treatment and stick with it. Their worry for him is heartbreaking. His wife, Gisele, takes care to ensure that their three children won’t blame themselves for their father’s state. The children cover Fetterman’s hospital room with colorful Post-it notes, reminding him how much he is loved.\n\nWhen it comes to his mental health, Fetterman is willing to concede that he was wrong. He tried resisting treatment at first, out of despondency and denial. He felt something shift when a therapist reminded him how much his children needed him. “The doctors had saved my life,” he writes.\n\n“Unfettered” includes surprisingly little about his political positions. The pages that do have him defending himself from progressives who have been startled by his eagerness to work with President Trump, whom he visited at Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration.\n\nFetterman, who says he wants “compassionate” immigration policy,  was one of 12 Democratic senators who sided with Republicans in undermining due process for immigrants, and he was the only Democratic senator who voted to confirm Trump’s pick for attorney general. “It is not anti-immigrant to support a secure border,” he writes, though he does not say how he feels about what Trump’s version of a secure border has meant in practice — masked men pushing people into vans and immigrants being whisked away to countries they have no connection to. Fetterman’s wife, who was brought as a child to the United States from Brazil, was an undocumented immigrant. He doesn’t say anything in the book about that either.\n\nHe is similarly pat regarding his views on Israel, and his unconditional support for its  war in Gaza. According to a letter by his former chief of staff that became a national story this spring, the senator “claims to be the most knowledgeable source on Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news — he declines most briefings and never reads memos.” In his memoir, he issues a pro forma line about grieving “the tragedy, the death and the misery,” but treats his position as a no-brainer. “There was no choice,” he writes.\n\nThe voice in this book is brooding but not particularly thoughtful. Fetterman offers generalized contempt instead of pointed arguments. He thinks one of the Democrats’ main problems is that they are perceived as “soft and gooey” because of their “policies against men.” While it’s true that Democrats have lost support among male voters, Fetterman never specifies which “policies” these are, but he insists they were decisive: “If men are forced to choose between picking their party or keeping their balls, most men are going to choose their balls.”\n\nA preoccupation with tough-guy masculinity seems to be an underlying theme. A flashback to 2001 has Fetterman fondly recalling how he made his home in the basement of an abandoned church in Braddock: “The place has a ‘Fight Club’ feel to it that I like, big and dingy and sparse and conducive to men beating the hell out of one another without anyone else hearing it.” In 2013, Fetterman thought he heard gunshots outside of his home and then chased a nearby jogger, using a 20-gauge shotgun to detain him until the police arrived. The jogger was Black and unarmed. Fetterman maintains that his political opponents were being grossly unfair when they criticized him: “If I had stayed indoors, they would have called me a coward.”\n\nAnyone who has experienced depression will probably recognize the overgeneralization, the binary thinking, the closed loop of self-pity. At barely more than 200 pages, “Unfettered” is not especially long, but it starts to feel interminable. “I have been told I have a persecution complex,” Fetterman writes, “but that’s the way I am.”\n\nUNFETTERED | By John Fetterman | Crown | 213 pp. | $32\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/health/als-young-women.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:36:32-05:00","title":"The Young Women Grappling With an ‘Old Man’s Disease’","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the experiences of young women in their 20s and early 30s diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease historically associated with older men.

You just never know what shape it will be in when you get it back, she said.\n\n“I tell them, ‘Take the best care of it you can,’” she said. “Those wheels are my legs! Those wheels are my life.”\n\nMs. Brous, 38, who lives in Hico, Texas, was one of dozens of women who converged on the Sea Crest Beach Resort on Cape Cod toward the end of summer for the gathering of a club no one really wanted to be a member of: women diagnosed in their 20s and early 30s with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S.\n\nThe terminal neurodegenerative disorder robs them of the ability to talk, walk, use their hands or even breathe. It has long been seen as a disease of older men, who make up a majority of patients. There is no cure.\n\nThe women traveled with husbands, mothers, sisters and aides, and they did not travel light. Their packing lists included heavy BiPAP machines to help them breathe, formula for their feeding tubes, commodes, portable bidets, myriad chargers, leg braces and canes, pills and pill crushers and bottles of a medication with gold nanoparticles that was still being tested in clinical trials.\n\nHalf of Ms. Brous’s suitcase was filled with party gifts for the friends she texts with throughout the year on an endless WhatsApp chat, including bags of popcorn with Texan flavors like Locked and Loaded, a Cheddar, bacon, sour cream and chives combo that you can only get in Hico.\n\nDesiree Galvez Kessler’s sister drove her, her mother and an aide up from Long Island in a van with a clunky Hoyer transfer lift in the back. Ms. Kessler — Desi to her friends — was diagnosed at 29, and has not been able to walk or speak for 10 years; the large computer tablet that she communicates with using eye-gaze technology is mounted on her wheelchair.\n\nMs. Kessler, 40, was also toting two magnum bottles of Casamigos Reposado tequila. She was planning to party.\n\nFrida Hansson, 40, traveled the farthest, all the way from a small town in Sweden, near Malmo. She can still walk, but not easily, and she had called the airports in advance to find out how far away the gates were and if there were steps to the plane.\n\nThe five-day retreat for members of Her A.L.S. Story, a community of women diagnosed in their 20s and early 30s, offered an opportunity to be with others in the same treacherous boat. When schnapps was offered, people asked, “Do you want to take it orally or not?” No one noticed if you ate slowly, or if you had to be fed.\n\nIt was a chance to feel almost normal.\n\n“They get me,” Ms. Hansson said of the others in the group.\n\nShe likes the rapport among the women. A similar group she connected with in Sweden had been laser-focused on finding a cure for A.L.S., to the point where “I think they’ve stopped enjoying the life they have now,” she said.\n\n“The attitude here,” Ms. Hansson said, “is, ‘Screw this, where’s my drink?’”\n\nMany of the women had tried traditional A.L.S. support groups but found little in common with others on the Zoom calls, most of whom were older men. The programs there centered on how to share the news with grandchildren, or whether they needed to retire early.\n\n“I was concerned with trying to find shoes that could work with my foot braces and still be stylish, and navigating my way around the city avoiding stairs,” said Leah Stavenhagen, 32, whose frustration led her to start the women’s group in 2021, two years after her diagnosis.\n\nMs. Stavenhagen wanted to talk with other women about how to manage her hair and makeup when she could not do it herself. How to manage her periods when her fingers were too weak to manipulate tampons. Whether she could do something to stop menstruation altogether, since she was also coming to terms with the devastating realization that she would not have children. And, of course, there was the matter of sex.\n\n“A.L.S. is such an isolating disease, constantly stripping away pieces of you that make you you,” Ms. Brous said. “You’re always having to ask someone else to be your arms and legs and your driver, and it’s easier to say, ‘It’s easier if I stay home.’ But that isolation will eat you alive.”\n\n“With a group like this where A.L.S. is neutralized, you can just be your most authentic self,” she said. “That’s everything. It’s the cherry on the top of this horrible disease.”\n\nMs. Brous’s first symptom was a tremor in her left ring finger. She was 27 at the time, and it wasn’t painful, so she did not think much about it. She called it her “party trick.”\n\nJessica Northrop, 39, a massage therapist in Anaheim, Calif., started dropping the lotion bottle she used with clients and had trouble holding the hot stones. She occasionally had uncontrollable fits of laughing or crying, one of the effects of the disease.\n\n“I thought I was losing my mind,” she said. She was 29 at the time, and just about to move out of her parents’ home and get her own apartment.\n\nKelly McGinn, 41, couldn’t get her thumb to clutch a cup or a can. That was two or three years ago. She thought to herself, “Look at my hands being stupid.”\n\nMs. Stavenhagen’s toes dragged when she walked, but she was 26 then, living in Paris with her college boyfriend, and her whole life seemed to be “coming together.” So she put off going to the doctor. “I thought there was just something wrong with my foot,” she said.\n\nOther women said they started tripping and falling. They told themselves they had always been clumsy. Some started slurring their words and having trouble talking; they sounded like a record played on the wrong speed.\n\nOne thought the weakness in her hands was carpal tunnel syndrome. Maybe surgery would fix it.\n\n“I thought I just had a pinched nerve,” Ms. McGinn said.\n\nIt took over a year for most of them to learn they had A.L.S., commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, named after the Yankees baseball player who was diagnosed at 36.\n\nThe disease has always skewed toward men and older individuals. The average age of diagnosis is 55, according to the A.L.S. Association. There’s no evidence those trends have changed significantly, or that more young women are developing it.\n\n“It’s relatively rare for young women to develop A.L.S., but unfortunately it’s not impossible — it can strike at any age,” said Dr. Sabrina Paganoni, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham whose research focuses on new therapies for A.L.S.\n\nBut it is not the first thing that comes to a doctor’s mind. Most physicians have never seen A.L.S. in a young woman, and do not want to find it; the average life expectancy is five years.\n\nThere is no definitive test or biomarker, so the diagnostic process can be protracted. Other conditions generally must be ruled out first.\n\nBy the time Ms. Northrop went to the doctor, she was losing her ability to speak. The doctor told her that she was fine, and that she was suffering from depression. She was puzzled. “About what?” she said.\n\nMs. Kessler was pregnant when she first felt weakness in her right hand, but her obstetrician was dismissive. She was diagnosed shortly after she gave birth, at 29, when she started having trouble buttoning up her baby’s onesies.\n\nWhen the women began having symptoms, their parents often hoped it would turn out to be something different — Lyme disease, even multiple sclerosis.\n\nA family acquaintance who was a physician told Ms. Stavenhagen there had to be a mistake.\n\n“You’re a young woman,” she recalled the doctor saying. “There’s no way you have A.L.S.”\n\nThe women often use dark humor as a buffer against the horrors of the disease.\n\nIn the spring, Ms. Brous said she asked on the chat group if anyone was giving up something for Lent. The women didn’t miss a beat.\n\n“The answers were, ‘Yeah, the use of my arms!’” Ms. Brous said. “‘Feeding myself.’ ‘Walking.’ ‘Talking.’”\n\n“We try to celebrate small things, like that it’s been a week since I peed in my pants,” she said. “That’s a big thing in our world.”\n\nJokes grant them an element of control over the disease. “If you approach it with a little humor, you own it more, instead of it owning you,” Ms. Hansson said.\n\nThe annual gatherings also bring together the caregivers: the husbands and mothers and sisters and cousins who help feed, dress, change and clean the women with A.L.S. Who interpret for them when they can no longer speak.\n\nSeveral of the mothers have biweekly chats between the annual gatherings to help one another troubleshoot, said Susan Stavenhagen, Ms. Stavenhagen’s mother.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for drugs for the insomnia that comes with A.L.S.? The anxiety? How do we handle the uncontrollable fits of laughter and crying?\n\n“Your child looks to you for answers,” Ms. Stavenhagen said. “Sometimes you can’t provide it.”\n\nEven after you get something figured out, it changes, she said. That is the nature of the disease. It keeps progressing.\n\nThe mothers try to shield their daughters from their own pain.\n\n“I’m the mom. I want to be strong for her. I’m supposed to be the support,” Ms. Stavenhagen said. “If she doesn’t want to be sad, which I know she doesn’t, I want to meet her where she is.”\n\nOver the course of five days at the resort, perched on Buzzards Bay, the women did things they haven’t been able to do in quite a while. A local organization provided floating beach wheelchairs, and Brianna Salgado, a 30-year-old who lives in Miami, was able to get in the ocean for the first time in five years. (Asked how it felt, she said, “Cold!”)\n\nHair stylists and makeup artists came in one afternoon to get the women glammed up for a dinner and drag show dedicated to Elena Coccio, a young Rhode Island woman whose disease moved swiftly, killing her within a year of diagnosis. She was 27 and obsessed with drag shows, her mother, Liz Coccio said.\n\nThe makeup artists managed to cover up a huge shiner Ms. McGinn was sporting after a bad fall. Ms. Hansson got a tattoo of an ampersand, which has become an important symbol for the women.\n\n“The meaning is that you can have two thoughts at the same time, and two identities at the same time,” she said. “You can have this illness, and at the same time also want to take a shot of tequila.”\n\nRead by Roni Caryn Rabin\n\nAudio produced by Patricia Sulbarán.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/mamdani-nyc-voters-election-demographics.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"03:00:28-05:00","title":"The Demographic Trends That Shaped Mamdani’s Win","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani won the 2025 New York City mayoral election with over one million votes and the highest turnout in more than 60 years, uniting a broad coalition of voters including young people, renters, and newly engaged immigrant and minority communities.

Whether motivated by party loyalty or the candidate’s message, more than one million New Yorkers cast ballots for him — part of the highest turnout in a mayoral election in more than 60 years.\n\nIn his nine-point win, Mr. Mamdani largely expanded on the base he built during the primary in neighborhoods across the city. He swept communities of every income level, save for New York’s wealthiest enclaves, where his top opponent, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, performed best. In the city’s bluest districts, Mr. Mamdani ran up the score with high turnout that overwhelmingly favored him.\n\nMr. Cuomo performed strongly in some of the city’s more conservative corners and did well with the voters who supported President Trump last November.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s success with different voting groups — from older, moderate Black voters to young white progressives — highlighted the breadth of his coalition. Taken together, the results underline how New York City’s diverse, unruly and often competing interest groups coalesced into a novel voting bloc that could offer national Democrats a road map for future competitive elections.\n\nThough New York’s politics tend to sit to the left of the rest of the country’s, the city’s Democrats, when given the choice between a moderate, well-known establishment candidate and a left-leaning political newcomer, opted  for change.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s performance and his ability to turn out voters could now reshape the politics of the city for a generation. Here are the demographic trends that contributed to his win on Nov. 4:\n\nThe people-powered machine that  galvanized millennials and Gen Zers for Mr. Mamdani during the primary delivered again last Tuesday. In precincts where the median age is under 45, his average margin of victory was 30 points — among the highest of any demographic group.\n\nVoters younger than 45 — about 46 percent of registered voters in the city — made up about 43 percent of those who cast their ballots in person early or on Election Day. That outpaces the 2022 midterms, when Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, narrowly fought off a challenge from Lee Zeldin. That year, younger voters made up 36 percent of those who voted. (Mail ballots, which are still being accounted for in the 2025 election, generally make up a  small share of overall votes.)\n\nIn interviews, young voters said they were motivated by Mr. Mamdani’s message about making New York affordable and felt his policies could make the city more livable. Many pointed specifically to his plan to freeze rents for rent-stabilized apartments.\n\n“I feel like a lot of people are out of the loop. Especially politicians are out of the loop when it comes to everyday struggles of people,” said Gaoussou Dibassy, 19, who described struggles to afford public transportation and groceries. “Mamdani brings a refreshing sense that he understands us, and that he knows what we’re going through, and he’s looking to address the problems that will actually impact our lives.”\n\nUltimately, Mr. Mamdani won decisively in the precincts that are home to the largest share of renters, winning them by more than 20 percentage points.\n\nBlack voters, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting base, offered tepid support to Mr. Mamdani during the primary. Mr. Cuomo handily outperformed him in the city’s heavily Black precincts, winning those where at least 60 percent of residents are Black with 62 percent of the vote. Mr. Cuomo did particularly well in key Black communities in Southeast Queens and the Bronx.\n\nMany Black voters expressed concern about Mr. Mamdani’s thin record and ambitious policy plans, saying that his support of a rent freeze in particular could harm Black homeowners. Establishment Democrats and Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, amplified those concerns and described Mr. Mamdani as the avatar of young, white newcomers who were displacing longtime Black residents.\n\nBut Mr. Mamdani’s campaign focused on making up ground with Black voters through concerted outreach efforts and several key endorsements.\n\nBy Election Day, the standing of Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Cuomo in 479 precincts with large numbers of Black voters had flipped. Mr. Mamdani won those areas with 61 percent of the vote, among his strongest performances in the city.\n\nAt one polling site in Jamaica, Queens, Carmen Patrick, 73, said she made a last-minute decision to vote for Mr. Mamdani on Election Day. She had been leaning toward supporting Mr. Cuomo, but changed her mind when President Trump endorsed him that week.\n\n“I don’t want one of his lackeys there,” she said of Mr. Trump. Still, Ms. Patrick, a retired hospital worker, added that she was “questioning how” Mamdani would accomplish his goals.\n\nThe rapidly shifting demographics in New York have been a source of anxiety for many voters — but the mayoral campaigns saw the changes as a political opportunity.\n\nEven as Mr. Mamdani fought off perceptions that he represented the interests of gentrifiers, in neighborhoods where the nonwhite population is shrinking he notched some of his strongest performances. In parts of the city where the Black or Hispanic population share had declined and the white population share had grown since before the pandemic, Mr. Mamdani won by more than 50 percentage points.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s allies contend that his campaign’s focus on affordability will carry over to his approach to governing, benefiting the city’s natives as much as its newcomers. The mayor-elect has pledged to push for policies that will keep more of the city’s longtime residents of color in their communities while helping the city’s younger, newer residents eke out a living.\n\nThe president outperformed his 2020 margins in his deep-blue hometown last November. This year, Mr. Cuomo picked up some of the same corners of the city: He won by more than 42 percentage points in the precincts that the president won in 2024.\n\nMr. Trump threw his support behind Mr. Cuomo during the last days of the campaign, saying he saw the former governor as a better alternative to Mr. Mamdani, who he falsely claimed was a communist.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, won just over 7 percent of the vote citywide. While nearly 242,000 Republicans voted, Mr. Sliwa garnered just over 146,000 votes. That means that even if nearly all Sliwa’s voters were registered Republicans, 40 percent of the total Republican vote went to another candidate.\n\nMr. Sliwa faced considerable pressure from conservatives and allies of Mr. Cuomo to drop out of the race and consolidate the anti-Mamdani coalition. But even if all of Mr. Sliwa’s votes had gone to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Mamdani still would have won.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s campaign tried to engage South Asian voters from Day 1. Many of his earliest supporters were immigrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan and were probably among the tens of thousands of New Yorkers who voted this year for the first time.\n\nMuslim voters, too, emerged as a new political force on behalf of Mr. Mamdani, who will be the first Muslim mayor of New York. About a half-million Muslims live in the city, according to a recent survey of religious congregations by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies.\n\nSome Muslims pointed to the final weeks of the campaign as a driver of their turnout, saying that the Islamophobic attacks Mr. Mamdani faced from his opponents in both parties inspired them to support him.\n\nThe city’s Orthodox Jewish communities voted overwhelmingly for the former governor, as they had done in the primary. Mr. Cuomo won precincts in Borough Park, Dyker Heights and south Williamsburg, all of which have large ultra-Orthodox communities. In some of those precincts, Mr. Cuomo received more than 90 percent of the vote.\n\nMr. Mamdani won in Crown Heights with 71 percent of the vote, carrying nearly every precinct in a community that has been gentrifying but still has a large Black population. The handful of precincts he lost there were in an area near Eastern Parkway with a large Orthodox Jewish population, where Mr. Cuomo won with 70 percent of the vote.\n\nThe broader Jewish electorate in New York was much more split, pre-election polling indicated. Mr. Mamdani’s criticism of Israel and its conduct in the war in Gaza starkly divided many of the city’s Jewish residents, reflecting the differing views on Israel within the community.\n\nTim Balk and Wesley Parnell contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/arts/television/late-night-democrats-government-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"02:39:15-05:00","title":"Late Night Is Disappointed in Democrats Over Shutdown Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article, published on November 11, 2025, discusses a 40-day government shutdown that ended after significant political negotiations involving eight Democratic members voting with Republicans.

Is Disappointed in Democrats Over Shutdown Deal\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T02:39:15-05:00\n\nWelcome to Late Night Roundup, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.\n\nEight members of the Democratic Caucus voted on Monday with Republicans to end the nation’s longest ever government shutdown.\n\n“Our long national nightmare is different,” Stephen Colbert said in his “Late Show” monologue.\n\n“Yes, the shutdown may have been long and painful for millions of Americans, but at least it achieved jack squat.” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n“But these Democratic defectors did get one concession. Senate majority leader John Thune promised them a vote on the A.C.A. in December — ’cause that’s when people get down to serious work: December.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, referring to the Affordable Care Act\n\n“Americans overwhelmingly support the Democrats’ push to keep health care costs down. Record numbers of people showed up for historic protests. The president’s poll numbers are historically bad. He just got booed at a football game, and voters handed Democrats huge victories in Tuesday’s elections. So naturally, Senate Democrats looked at all that and said, ‘Now is the time to cave.’” — SETH MEYERS\n\n“This was such a big cave by the Democrats, Bruce Wayne offered to buy it.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“Democrats, you sold out the entire shutdown not to get what you wanted, but for a promise to not get what you wanted later. Where in ‘The Art of War …?’” — JON STEWART, trying to find a relevant passage in the Sun Tzu book.\n\n“After 40 days, senators finally agreed on a deal to end the longest government shutdown in history. Yeah. And besides every airport turning into a real-life ‘Squid Game,’ no harm done.” — JIMMY FALLON\n\n“Meanwhile, last night, Trump attended the Washington Commanders home game against the Detroit Lions. And before the game, Air Force One did a flyover above the stadium. Yeah, it was historic ’cause that was the only plane that took off yesterday.” — JIMMY FALLON\n\n“Do you know how [expletive] unpopular you have to be to be booed by football fans while swearing in troops? And, by the way, not just any football fans — football fans who still use the term ‘Redskins,’ and not even with respect to the team, just casually.” — JON STEWART\n\n“Do you think he can hear the boos or does the narcissism force field block it all out?” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“It’s like a whole stadium full of Melanias.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“I have watched a lot of football. I’ve never seen anyone get booed this badly, not even Left Shark.” — SETH MEYERS\n\n”I mean, he’s getting flipped off by both Lions fans and Commander fans. He finally did it — he brought the country together.” — SETH MEYERS\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel Live” kicked off a 1980s-themed week of shows with guest George Clooney on Monday.\n\nThe “Train Dreams” star Joel Edgerton will sit down with Seth Meyers on Tuesday’s “Late Night.”\n\nA new New York Public Library exhibition features nearly two centuries of cultural, social and political artifacts on Middle Easterners and North Africans in the city.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/opinion/veterans-day-world-war-ii.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"01:00:08-05:00","title":"'Thanks, U.S.A.'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eighty-one years ago, American soldiers established a cemetery in Margraten, Netherlands, during the final months of World War II.

the advancing U.S. Army stood in a rain-soaked farm field in Margraten, the Netherlands, and established a cemetery. Over the winter and spring that followed, the bloody final months of World War II in Europe transformed that quiet stretch of land into a huge American cemetery, its soil turned over with thousands of fresh graves.\n\nThe fields at Margraten would become one of 14 permanent overseas military cemeteries set aside for America’s World War II dead that the U.S. government maintains in perpetuity. These beautiful, haunting places were dedicated by still-grieving Americans in the years that followed the war, remembering its awful costs and praying for a lasting peace.\n\nThere are fewer and fewer people still alive who lived through World War II. Margraten and the other cemeteries serve as reminders of the sacrifices that Americans made to free Europe. And, at a time when many Americans want to retreat from our responsibilities to the rest of the world, they offer us a warning.\n\nThe American service members buried in the soil of Europe grew up in a country where many respectable politicians claimed America had no business preserving peace on the European continent or promoting freedom in the world. There was no NATO, no United Nations, no American-led global order.\n\nWhen you stoop down on European soil to read an American soldier’s name on a grave, you see how policies sold as “America First” can lead to unthinkable suffering and loss.\n\nTravel through Europe today and you’ll see the war-forged American-European partnership embedded everywhere — in gleaming embassies and in hulking military bases, in ubiquitous English-language ads and in the YouTube clips streaming on teenagers’ phones. But nowhere does the tie between the people on both sides of the Atlantic feel more intimate as in the World War II cemeteries.\n\nApproximately 8,300 graves are at Margraten, one of a handful of out-of-the-way cemeteries for America’s war dead near the German borders of France, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Many of the service members buried in these places died in the western Allies’ assault on Germany and its forces in late 1944 and early 1945.\n\nOn the late summer day that I visited, the cemetery was bustling with visitors — grandparents holding the hands of little children, vacationers in bike shorts, 20-somethings with tattoos. From their hushed, respectful voices, I gathered that most of these people were Dutch.\n\nMargraten lies in the southern part of the Limburg region of the Netherlands, where American troops were billeted in the final months of the European war and where the role of the United States in liberating the country from Nazi occupation is fondly recalled. The Dutch people have long taken pride in the grave adoption here. In a tradition that stretches back to the first Memorial Day after the war, every service member honored in the cemetery has a Dutch adopter who brings flowers and visits his or her place of memorial. Some even correspond with the deceased’s family in the United States.\n\nThis has always been an essential task of the World War II cemeteries — shrinking the distance across an ocean through the memory of shared sacrifice.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of hostilities in 1945, the U.S. government announced that, as it had after World War I, it would create permanent overseas cemeteries for the dead. The families of service members whose remains had been recovered overseas had a choice: Their loved ones could be repatriated to the United States or buried beside other Americans in their theater of battle.\n\nIn each of the World War II cemeteries, rippling rows of identical white marble crosses and Stars of David mark the final resting place of Americans killed. Each bears an inscription that includes the person’s name, rank, unit, home state and date of death. Some say simply: “Here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known but to God.”\n\nWalking through these rows of graves, you feel the sorrow the war visited on every corner of American society. A service member from Oregon lies next to one from Pennsylvania who lies next to one from Arkansas. Dumas is next to Ulander, next to Giudice, next to Smith.\n\nBut in their beauty, ambition and scale, the cemeteries have also always sent a message to Europeans, a reminder of the costs Americans were willing to pay to ensure the cause of liberty in the world. These cemeteries would be permanent and so too, they seemed to suggest, would be America’s interest in Europe’s affairs.\n\nIt is a message that many Europeans took to heart. At the visitors’ center at the Margraten, I was told that the large crowd in the cemetery that day was typical. The vast majority of visitors are Europeans. When I flipped through the guest book, I saw most of the entries were people from the Netherlands, Belgium and other Northern European countries. Many had written the same message: “Thanks, U.S.A.”\n\nReading these words, I felt a pang of regret: If only more Americans could see this place.\n\nIt is now more than ever, after all, that America needs the message of its World War II cemeteries. On a Veterans Day when optimism about the American experiment can be hard to summon, they transport us back to a moment when America was an essential force for good.\n\nIn today’s Europe, the need for such a partner remains. At Margraten that August morning, I spoke with a Dutch woman who’d come to visit the cemetery with her young son. He was learning at school about “the problems in the world,” she explained. He’s a little bit nervous, she said, about what would happen “if the Russians come.” She gestured at the rows of graves all around her: “So it’s very important to see everything.”\n\nNot far from where we were standing was Margraten’s “Statue of the Mourning Woman,” a large bronze cast sculpture by the American artist Joseph Kiselewski. It depicts an outsize female figure, a trio of doves at her side, gazing down on an obliterated tree. All she sees is what too many of us have forgotten: the lonely, terrible sorrow that comes in the wake of war.\n\nJonathan Darman, a journalist and historian, is the author of “Becoming FDR: The Personal Crisis that Made a President” and “Landslide: LBJ and Ronald Reagan at the Dawn of a New America.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

He also appeared on television, in roles large and small, and in several plays.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Maternity Deserts, a Midwife Fills a Void\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T11:12:22-05:00\n\nStaysha Quentrill is often called to work in the middle of the night. Occasionally, she needs to get a ride in an off-road vehicle to a mother in labor. Once this year, she oversaw a birth in an Airbnb. Ms. Quentrill catches babies in bedrooms and bathrooms, on living room floors and in inflatable birthing pools.\n\nOne of the few midwives attending home births in West Virginia, Ms. Quentrill has added some 30,000 miles to her car’s odometer in the last year, traveling across the state to provide care. She has attended hundreds of births, most of them uncomplicated. But even in the best of circumstances, midwifery is high-stakes work. “You’re responsible for two lives,” Ms. Quentrill, 36, said. She has seen shoulders wedged tight behind a pubic bone. With a firm rub and a few squeezes from a ventilation bag, she has resuscitated babies born not breathing, she said, their “lungs like a closed balloon.”\n\nBut for her, the job comes with additional risks.\n\nWest Virginia is one of 13 states that do not license midwives unless they are nurses, even if they have been nationally certified, as Ms. Quentrill has. With no laws around midwives who aren’t nurses and no available state licensure, Ms. Quentrill is left to operate in what she considers a “sort of legal gray area.” In other states, midwives in similar positions have faced charges of practicing medicine without a license. In Georgia, one woman was threatened with a $500 fine for each time she called herself a midwife.\n\nStill, Ms. Quentrill believes the work is too important for her to stop. Today in West Virginia, as in a growing number of states, there is a need for people who know how to deliver babies.\n\nMore than a quarter of the state’s hospitals have closed their delivery units since 2010. More than 60 percent have no obstetric care. In nearly half of the state’s counties, there are no birthing hospitals, and not a single practicing obstetrician. The state is also home to only one birth center, a childbirth facility typically run by midwives. Pregnant women spend hours driving to appointments. Babies are born on the side of highways and in emergency rooms. When due dates approach, women sleep on other people’s couches to be close to a hospital.\n\nOne delivery at a time, Ms. Quentrill and other midwives are trying to provide another option, by reviving the region’s culture of community-based care.\n\nNationally, a small but growing number of women are giving birth at home, and West Virginia is no exception. In the United States, most of these home births are overseen by people with Ms. Quentrill’s credential: certified professional midwife. The North American Registry of Midwives, the credentialing body, does not require a nursing license or university degree, though some of the midwives have one or both. But the certification does call for extensive training, including attending at least 55 births under the supervision of an experienced midwife. It is also the only certification that requires out-of-hospital birth experience.\n\nMany doctors and nurses are opposed to certified professional midwives and home births in general, seeing them as unnecessarily risky. But Beth Redden, who for years was the rare midwife with a nursing license attending home births in West Virginia, said she found practitioners like Ms. Quentrill “provide evidence-based, safe, effective, high-quality care.”\n\n“Every year West Virginia fails to license them, they’re failing their constituents,” she added. “They’re failing Appalachian people who are just looking for care.”\n\nBefore Ms. Quentrill joined the profession, midwives delivered her own babies. She had the first four of her seven children at the birth center. But because the risk of complications rises after a certain number of deliveries, the center’s policy at the time was to refer women having a fifth baby to the hospital.\n\nInstead, she had her fifth baby at home with midwives, and then two more. The experience gave her a feeling of unwavering support and complete autonomy. In 2020, Ms. Quentrill decided she wanted to pass on that feeling to others.\n\nShe sought training she felt harked back to a community of midwives, many of them Black, who operated in Appalachia over a century ago.\n\nIn the early 20th century, though, that community came under attack, part of a broader push to shift the birthing process out of the home and into hospitals, and to curb high infant and maternal mortality. In 1925, West Virginia began requiring midwives to apply for a license. The same year, a nurse named Mary Breckinridge established what became known as the Frontier Nursing Service, which trained nurses as midwives and deployed them, on horseback, to families in Appalachia.\n\nMs. Breckinridge is sometimes hailed as the “mother of American midwifery.” But she refused to hire or educate Black midwives, and denounced those still practicing in Appalachia.\n\nIn West Virginia, the state said midwives had to be able to read and write, possess a diploma from a midwifery program or have a doctor verify their skills and prove their cleanliness and moral character.\n\nFor many community-based midwives, the educational criteria were difficult to meet, and their numbers dwindled. In the 1970s, West Virginia amended the 1925 law, removing any path to licensure for midwives who were not nurses.\n\nNationally, midwives moved into hospitals and birth centers, and the home birthrate dropped below 1 percent. Appalachia’s culture of community midwifery died off almost entirely.\n\nLearning of this history, Ms. Quentrill decided not to pursue a nursing degree, though she understood that meant she’d be practicing without legal recognition in her state.\n\n“I knew I wanted to focus specifically on home birth and being in the community,” she said. “Especially when it comes to Black midwifery, this is our birthright.”\n\nOn a warm afternoon earlier this year, Ms. Quentrill sat in Carmen Squires’s living room as a 9-week-old Rottweiler sniffed around her ankles.\n\nMs. Squires, who is Black, said she sought out Ms. Quentrill because it felt more comfortable to have “a midwife who looks like me.” Thirty percent of Black women report mistreatment during pregnancy and childbirth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many feel ignored, their concerns dismissed. Ms. Squires felt that working with Ms. Quentrill might insulate her from that possibility.\n\nThe traditional obstetric care Ms. Squires received during her first three pregnancies often felt rushed. Appointments with Ms. Quentrill felt more like a visit between friends. Ms. Squires’s two youngest children drifted in and out of the room. Her older children’s laughter spilled from the kitchen. The puppy fell asleep leaning against Ms. Quentrill as the two women talked.\n\nIt was close to 45 minutes before Ms. Quentrill opened her backpack full of supplies. Eventually, Ms. Quentrill drew some blood from Ms. Squires, 35, for routine first-trimester testing, then moved closer on the couch to sweep a hand-held Doppler wand along Ms. Squires’s belly.\n\nBecause she doesn’t have a state license, she has had to figure out workarounds. Unable to bill insurance, she charges $5,000, though she and other midwives sometimes offer discounts or barter midwifery services for car repairs or landscaping. She’s accompanied by another midwife or birth assistant at each delivery. If a patient needs antibiotics or other medications, Ms. Quentrill brings a nurse to administer them.\n\nShe said she does carry and, when necessary, injects clients with a synthetic oxytocin to stop postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can be lifesaving, she said she’s willing to defend the choice to administer it herself, should that ever become necessary.\n\nMs. Quentrill believes that home birth is not for everyone. She doesn’t attempt breech deliveries or accept clients having twins or triplets, and she carefully considers other risks, including the mother’s weight, age and blood pressure. She refers higher-risk women elsewhere. And she always has a plan in place for getting to a hospital, which she said she acts on around 15 to 20 percent of the time.\n\nDr. Kimberly Farry, an OB-GYN in Buckhannon, W.Va., said that in her experience, certified professional midwives were “for the most part, pretty darn good at really assessing the risks of their patients.” If they were licensed, she could imagine calling on them to check on clients deep in West Virginia’s hills in the event of an emergency. And for some women with low-risk pregnancies, Dr. Jeremy Applebaum, an OB-GYN at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said home birth is a good option.\n\nMs. Quentrill said she has never had a mother or baby die on her watch. And some studies have found planned home births to be relatively safe for women with low-risk pregnancies. But they do often list midwives as co-authors, and the official stance of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that the safest place to give birth is a hospital or accredited birth center.\n\nThe organization cites research by Dr. Amos Grünebaum and Dr. Frank Chervenak, both professors of obstetrics and gynecology at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, which found home births are associated with an increase in the risk of infant death.\n\n“There’s no way to get around this,” Dr. Chervenak said. “It is risky to deliver at home. There are many clinical scenarios where things can go wrong.”\n\nStill, Dr. Grünebaum said state licensure of community midwives could potentially help make home birth safer, by creating a pathway to connect midwives to doctors and hospitals, or requiring that they carry insurance and accept only low-risk patients.\n\nAnd, Dr. Chervenak added, “it’s better to have a midwife at a home birth than to have nothing at all.”\n\nFor years, Beth Redden, the nurse-midwife who attended home births in West Virginia, covered nine counties, often driving three hours to get from one client’s home to another. It was a recipe for burnout, and led her to lobby for years for certified professional midwives to be licensed.\n\nIn at least seven states, certified professional midwives are vying for licensure. This year, Ms. Quentrill and two other midwives worked on a state bill, which passed unanimously in the West Virginia Senate but was removed from the House agenda without explanation a few days before the end of the session.\n\nSoon after, Ms. Redden closed her home birth practice and went to work at the birth center. Without licensure to draw more midwives into the profession, she said she felt like help simply wasn’t coming.\n\n“You get tired after a while of beating your head against the wall,” she said. Though she feels guilt over the decision, “when nothing was changing, it was like ‘Man, I can’t do this anymore.’”\n\nBut Ms. Quentrill isn’t quitting. She intends to get a bill reintroduced early next year and, if needed, “every single year until it passes,” she said. In the meantime, she’ll keep showing up when mothers call.\n\n“It’s necessary,” she said, “and we’re going to continue to do it.”\n\nRead by Kate Morgan\n\nAudio produced by Sarah Diamond.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/opinion/ai-democracy-government-authoritarianism.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:01:37-05:00","title":"This Is No Way to Rule a Country","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Albania has become the first country to implement 'algocracy' by using an AI avatar named Diella to decide over $1 billion in government supplier contracts, aiming to eliminate corruption.

2025-11-11T05:01:37-05:00\n\nAlbania is the first country to take a real step toward “algocracy”: government by algorithm. In September its prime minister announced that all decisions concerning which private suppliers will provide goods and services to Albania’s government — over $1 billion annually — will be made by an A.I. avatar named Diella. Albania has long suffered from corruption, particularly in this realm. The unbiased, competent, algorithmic Diella is thought to be the solution.\n\nIt’s a seductive trade: When democratic systems fail, simply replace them with algorithmic ones. But it’s the wrong reflex. Algorithms can optimize efficiency, but they can’t decide between competing values — the very choices that lie at the heart of democratic politics. Without transparency about how Diella reaches its conclusions and without mechanisms to challenge its decisions, citizens will inevitably feel wronged and without recourse.\n\nRather than replace democracy with A.I., we must instead use A.I. to reinvigorate democracy, making it more responsive, more deliberative and more worthy of public trust.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t the path we’re currently on.\n\nA majority of adults across 12 high-income countries say they are dissatisfied with the way their democracy is working. We see this disaffection manifest in turnstiles ablaze, smashed storefronts and streets choked with tear gas — the seemingly endless churn of protests against governments that are perceived as out of touch, ineffective and corrupt.\n\nMeanwhile, A.I. systems continue to improve rapidly. We already have models that outstrip human performers in fields like geometry and medical imaging. The public is also becoming more familiar with the technology (even if Americans use it significantly less than those in many other nations do, most notably in China).\n\nPerhaps it isn’t surprising, then, that people around the world already trust emergent A.I. systems over established democratic ones. Three rounds of surveys run by the Collective Intelligence Project between March and August 2025 consistently found that people believed A.I. chatbots could make better decisions on their behalf than their elected representatives.\n\nThis pattern is as old as politics itself: When democracy struggles to deliver, people turn to strongmen, authoritarians and now algorithms, hoping for competence over chaos.\n\nBut replacing democratic deliberation with algorithmic efficiency doesn’t solve the underlying crisis. It merely substitutes one form of distance between people and power for another. When algorithms determine, say, budget allocations or public benefits with no explanation and no appeal, the result is the same alienation and disillusionment we’re already seeing from distant, unresponsive institutions — except now there’s no one to hold accountable. With human dignity relegated to an afterthought, polarization deepens and trust erodes further.\n\nThese problems compound the risks A.I. already poses. Today’s A.I.-powered algorithms are largely built around business models where conflict drives revenue. Since outrage keeps people clicking, ranking systems surface the most divisive material, fragmenting public discourse and driving us into echo chambers that make consensus seem impossible. As A.I. systems become more powerful and capable of ideological manipulation, these threats will only intensify.\n\nTo save democracy, America needs a different path: one that uses A.I. to give people more voice in our policy choices and better results.\n\nA.I. can help make governments more effective, cutting red tape, improving public services and opening up decision-making to the public. In Taiwan, the platform vTaiwan has spent over a decade demonstrating how A.I. can strengthen rather than supplant democratic deliberation. When Uber arrived in Taiwan in 2013, it triggered the same conflicts that erupted in cities worldwide: taxi drivers versus riders, incumbents versus newcomers, regulation versus innovation. Instead of letting the loudest voices dominate or having lobbyists and bureaucrats decide behind closed doors, Taiwan used A.I.-powered tools to facilitate some version of mass deliberation.\n\nThousands of citizens submitted statements to vTaiwan and voted on others’ proposals. The A.I. didn’t make decisions. Instead, it mapped the landscape of public opinion, surfacing the proposals that bridged divides rather than deepened them. The result was legislation derived from collective intelligence. For Uber, this meant allowing the service to keep operating as long as its drivers were insured, professionally licensed and didn’t undercut taxi fares. Taiwan has since used variations of this approach for dozens of other policy challenges, each one building trust with citizens and showing that A.I. can provide the infrastructure that enables large-scale democratic reasoning.\n\nDemocracy has always been limited by logistics: You can’t fit millions of people in a room; you can’t have everyone speak; you can’t process that many perspectives. A.I. has the ability to remove many of those constraints by summarizing thousands of public comments, identifying common concerns and helping policymakers understand constituent priorities. It can make legislative text accessible to ordinary citizens, explain trade-offs in plain language and help people articulate their preferences. It can even scale deliberation across geographies and languages, making global coordination feasible in ways that were previously unimaginable.\n\nBut the window for this path is not infinite. Every month that democracies remain dysfunctional while A.I. capabilities improve, algocracy becomes more appealing. It remains to be seen whether Diella will root out corruption in Albania or simply add another layer of opacity to government. But it will certainly attract imitators, especially in countries where corruption is endemic and institutions are weak.\n\nThe future of democracy doesn’t require us to reject A.I. Quite the opposite. We need A.I. to make democracy work for the 21st century. But we must also be careful about what we ask A.I. to do. Not to decide for us, but to help us govern ourselves better.\n\nEric Schmidt, a former chief executive and chairman of Google, is the author of “Genesis,” which explores how humans will evolve alongside artificial intelligence.

company that makes commercials for companies like Apple and Eli Lilly, from Los Angeles. But not much of her filming happens in the city, a longtime center for commercial production, anymore. In the past two months alone, she left Los Angeles to shoot in Glasgow, Prague, Mexico City and Toronto instead.\n\n“That’s several million dollars of production going offshore,” Ms. McArter said.\n\nIn Hollywood, commercial advertising has long been overshadowed by the far more glamorous film and television work. Less art, more commerce. Yet for decades, crew members have counted on commercial production shoots either as their sole source of income or as a way to pay the bills between lulls in film and television production.\n\nJust like television and film shoots, though, commercial production in Los Angeles has plummeted. Production in the third quarter of this year was 18 percent lower than last year, and 40 percent lower than the five-year average, according to a new report from FilmLA, the local government organization that tracks production in the area.\n\nThat has left a gaping hole in the longtime safety net for industry workers in the area just as those workers need it the most. And unlike for television and film, state lawmakers have not come to the rescue. A bill passed this year in California gives millions in tax breaks to production done in the state — but it excludes commercial work.\n\n“Commercials have been such a bread and butter for the industry, especially in L.A.,” said Matt Miller, the president of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, a trade group. “Commercials have always been something that kept the lights on in between television shows and movies.”\n\nThe result has major implications for the city, because commercials provide big benefits to the local economy without being much of a burden.\n\nStudios charge commercial productions higher daily rates for production space than those earned for longer film and television productions. The same goes for equipment rentals and locations. And when a commercial production comes to a neighborhood, it often provides a quick cash infusion into local economies with money spent on ancillary expenses such as catering, dry cleaning and hotel stays. And with a shoot often lasting only a few days, most productions rarely wear out their welcome.\n\nBut the reason for filming outside Los Angeles is the same for the advertising business as it is for the film and TV business: costs. Filming in Los Angeles is more expensive than in many other places.\n\nFrank Scherma, president and co-founder of the production company RadicalMedia, said the way some people in the city exploit commercial productions is partly to blame for the problem.\n\nTwenty years ago, he said, scouts would show up in a residential neighborhood, ring a doorbell and ask to use a house for production. Today, many homes in Los Angeles even have managers. When a production wants to rent a house, it not only has to pay to rent the location but often must pay a fee to the management company.\n\n“We stopped teaching our neighborhoods how important this business is to our society,” he said. “We forgot to go into neighborhoods and say, ‘Hey, the guy who lives up the block is a grip, and that’s how he pays his mortgage.’ We need to figure out how to make neighborhoods realize this is important.”\n\nAt this point, production companies have become fluent shooting elsewhere in the United States or overseas. Unless a celebrity who lives in Southern California is involved and will participate only if the job is local, advertising clients see little reason to shoot in Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia has never offered a tax incentive for commercial production, unlike two dozen other states, including New York, Georgia and Illinois. Mr. Miller of the commercial trade group said commercials were eliminated from eligibility from the tax breaks signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom this summer because the film and television industry had much more lobbying muscle in Sacramento.\n\nHe said his group had urged the same consortium of unions that backed the film bill, including the Directors Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood actors’ union, to join the commercial producers in their efforts, but they seemed disinclined, according to Mr. Miller, since film and television production accounts for a much larger percentage of their work.\n\n“It just feels so shortsighted,” added Mr. Miller, who is hopeful that he can bring renewed interest to the cause when the California Legislature returns to session in December. The lobbying group is planning to ask for $15 million in tax breaks to be dedicated to commercials. By comparison, Governor Newsom just doubled the amount available to film and television projects to $750 million.\n\nColleen Bell, the executive director of the state’s film commission, said in an email that her group continued to have conversations about how to support commercial production.\n\n“We understand why the commercial industry is advocating for a credit and appreciate the case they’ve made,” she said. “We’re open to continued engagement on this topic as we evaluate how best to support the industry and the state’s broader economic goals.”\n\nAli Brown, president of PrettyBird, a production company with offices in New York, Los Angeles and London, said she would prefer to shoot in Los Angeles. Ms. Brown’s company is owned by her and two others, and employs about 50 people. She often shoulders the production costs of her shoots, waiting for her clients to reimburse her.\n\nRecently, she bid on a project and was asked to provide budgets for shooting in both Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. She said that based strictly on expenses, the shoot would have cost $200,000 less if she shot it in Los Angeles because of a specialty crew required for the production. Yet once the Texas tax savings were figured in, the price tag in Austin was lower overall, and the client asked her to move the shoot there. Texas has also allocated a cash grant of $300 million every two years toward production costs.\n\n“It’s interesting — we are starting to have clients say, ‘No, move it,’ even though the locations were better here, the crew was better here, everything was better here,” she said. “It was purely a financial decision that brought us there.”\n\nSean French, the president of Versatile Studios, which provides production equipment in Los Angeles, said he started the company in 2023 expecting to cater to commercial production. But he has struggled to remain profitable.\n\n“I’ve managed to keep the business alive,” he said. “I’ve managed to be thrifty.”\n\nAnd he considers himself one of the lucky ones. He has had many competitors call and ask if he would consider buying their business, since they are not earning enough to service the debt costs on their equipment.\n\nMr. French, who is also on the board of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, said he thought the increased tax credit for film and television would wind up increasing commercial production, too.\n\n“I definitely believe that’s going to lead to some trickle-down economics within the commercial industry,” he added. “As those shows shoot, you’ve got to shoot promos for those shows. They do cross-branded advertising with different brands for those shows. I believe all that stuff will still come back to us.”\n\nThe one thing that keeps people optimistic about production in Los Angeles is that the crew base is bigger, more skilled and more willing to solve problems when they arise.\n\nMs. Brown reflected on a recent commercial she shot in multiple states. She said there was a sense of relief when the production got to Los Angeles.\n\n“Everybody was like, ‘Oh, my god, it’s so great to be in L.A.,’” she said, referring in particular to a can-do attitude that begins with “Yes” and then works to find a solution. “It wasn’t just me as a production company owner, but the agency and the client felt the same,” she said. “It’s just easier here.”\n\n"}]}
