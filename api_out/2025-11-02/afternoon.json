riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week \n       \n  By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In just a few days, the Supreme Court will start hearing arguments in what President Donald Trump is calling “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  With the bulk of his tariffs — arguably the cornerstone of his entire economic agenda — in jeopardy, he has floated an unprecedented appearance at the nation’s highest court.\n \n\n   \n  The case will consider whether Trump had the legal authority to impose tariffs by citing a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n \n\n   \n  Trump used those powers to push import tax rates as high as 50% on key trading partners including India and Brazil and  as high as 145%  on China earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  A ruling against the president does not mean the sudden cancellation of all tariffs in place, but the outcome could radically reshape Trump’s economic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s riding on the Supreme Court’s decision:\n \n\n   \n    Almost $90 billion in tariff revenue\n \n\n   \n  As of September 23, American businesses have paid nearly $90 billion to cover the IEEPA tariffs being challenged, according to US Customs and Border Patrol data. That’s more than half of the tariff revenue the country collected during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money” and reimburse companies for the billions of dollars they have already paid.\n \n\n   \n  While the case plays out — and it could go on for several months — businesses will need to keep paying IEEPA tariffs, so the sum of potential refunds will keep growing.\n \n\n   \n  However, it would not be an easy or quick process for businesses to get refunds. It’s also unclear if all businesses that have paid these tariffs would qualify for a refund. The justices would likely make such determinations if they ultimately render Trump’s IEEPA tariffs illegal, trade attorneys  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n    Trade agreements\n \n\n   \n  The threat of instantly imposing higher tariffs is a  key tool  Trump has used to pressure countries into entering trade agreements and, in some cases, signing deals with the United States. In exchange, trading partners have committed to increasing purchases of American goods and increasing their investments in American businesses on top of lowering tariffs on American exports.\n \n\n   \n  But all that could be jeopardized if the Supreme Court sides against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “The IEEPA tariffs have been the basis for countries to reach agreements with the United States, and it is unknown what happens if the IEEPA tariffs no longer can be imposed,” Dave Townsend, a partner in Dorsey & Whitney’s International Trade Group, said in a note last week.\n \n\n   \n  “Presumably, the Trump Administration will claim that nothing changes, and that the agreements remain valid,” he added. But it could certainly incentivize trading partners to try to go back to the drawing table with Trump, aiming to get better arrangements. It could even empower some countries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs on American exports until their own border taxes are lowered.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for Trump’s tariff agenda\n \n\n   \n  US presidents have always had an  extensive menu  of tariffs to impose. But Trump has mainly used two in his second term: the IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs, which give the president the authority to impose higher tariffs on national security grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Section 232 tariffs can only be used to target specific industry sectors, and require an investigation by the Commerce Department. Trump has used Section 232 this year to raise border taxes on autos, auto parts, steel, aluminum, copper and furniture, among others. He’s also initiated several ongoing investigations that could result in higher levies on a slew of other goods.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will retain the ability to impose those tariffs as well as several others no matter how the Supreme Court rules. But none of those will allow him to change import duties with the flick of a switch, as he has done with IEEPA.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/stabbing-huntingdon-train-england-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"04:47:00-05:00","title":"Nine people suffer life-threatening injuries in UK after train stabbing attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A stabbing attack occurred on a train traveling from Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross in central England, resulting in nine people suffering life-threatening injuries.

on Saturday night after a stabbing attack on a train in central England that Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as “deeply concerning.”\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested after the attack, which British Transport Police (BTP) declared “a major incident,” adding that counterterrorism officers were supporting the investigation. BTP also declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding this.\n \n\n   \n  Police said 10 people were taken to hospital, nine of whom suffered life-threatening injuries. No fatalities have been reported from the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Officers were called at at 7.42 p.m. to a report of the attack on the service from the northern city of Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross. Armed officers were deployed to Huntingdon station, where the train made an unplanned stop and the two people were arrested, police said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 12 hours after the incident, police had yet to reveal details about the suspected attackers.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Defence Minister John Healey told Sky News on Sunday that the incident appeared to be an “isolated attack.”\n \n\n   \n    Passenger saw suspect tasered\n \n\n   \n  Wren Chambers, who was on the train when the attack happened, told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down.\n \n\n   \n  “A minute or so later a man… was running down with a very clear wound, bleeding quite badly on his arm. And I thought it was like some sort of Halloween prank at first. But then he’s shouting that someone’s got a knife, he was stabbed,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running down the train, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  Another witness who was traveling on the train said he saw an “extremely bloodied” victim. The man, who gave his name as Gavin, told Sky News he believed he saw a suspect tasered before he was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  He said police shouted “Get down, get down” as they got closer to him.\n \n\n   \n  “He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him,” the eyewitness said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Another male passenger, Olly Foster, told the Daily Mail he’d been listening to an audiobook when the attack happened. “A young girl was distraught as the attacker tried to stab her, but a hero of an older man got in the way taking a gash on his forehead and I think another on his neck,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Video shared on social media of the immediate aftermath of the incident showed a bloodied person rushing out of Huntingdon station and dozens of police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights gathered outside. In one video armed officers were seen sprinting down a platform at the station toward the front end of a stationary train.\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey called it “a shocking incident” and said his thoughts were with those injured and their families.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,” he said. “At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.”\n \n\n   \n    Large-scale response\n \n\n   \n  Emergency first responders said they had mobilized a large-scale response to the stabbing attack, including sending several air ambulances.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement on X, the East of England Ambulance Service said it had sent “numerous ambulances, tactical commanders, our Hazardous Area Response Team, and critical care teams,” from several regional jurisdictions.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer said on social media: “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” he said on X.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”   \n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she is receiving regular updates on the investigation and urged people to avoid “speculation at this early stage” as to what was behind the stabbings.\n \n\n   \n  The rail company that operates trains on the East Coast Main Line, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), said that it was “experiencing major disruption across the LNER route.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n  “Our advice is ‘Do Not Travel’. Please defer your travel where you can,” LNER said.\n \n\n   \n  It remains unclear at this stage what crimes the attackers will be charged with. Homicide rates in the UK are low compared to other Western nations. Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics. In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011, although a 1% decrease was recorded over the past year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/hegseth-bars-military-officials-from-discussing-drug-boat-strikes-with-congress-without-prior-approval","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-05:00","title":"Hegseth Bars Military Officials from Discussing Drug Boat Strikes with Congress Without Prior Approval","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has implemented a new policy requiring Defense Department personnel to seek prior approval from his office before discussing sensitive military operations—such as strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America—with Congress.

military officials from discussing drug boat strikes with Congress without prior approval \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Office of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has disseminated a broad list of topics that Defense Department personnel are now required to seek prior approval on before engaging with Congress, which includes any and all “sensitive military operations” and US military strikes on suspected drug boats around Latin America, according to people familiar with the latest guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance was handed down following confusion over an initial memo issued by Hegseth that barred all Defense Department personnel, including military commanders, from talking to Congress or state lawmakers unless they have received prior approval from the agency’s office of legislative affairs.\n \n\n   \n  The list of topics that now “require prior coordination” with Hegseth’s office before engaging with Congress includes:\n \n\n   \n  Other topics include budget and reconciliation spending plans; critical minerals; Foreign Military Sales reform; AUKUS, a trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; anomalous health incidents also known as “Havana Syndrome”; and Spectrum, which refers to the electromagnetic spectrum that underpins military operations and other key US government functions.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Defense Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep. Don Bacon said on Saturday the policy amounted to “another amateur move” by the secretary that was resulting in military members being “afraid to communicate” with lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a five-time commander & our leadership WANTED us to engage members of Congress,” he  posted  on X. “We wanted to share what our great airmen were doing. We were proud of our service. The new rules have put a large barrier between the military & Congress. Pentagon says the change is very small. But I already see the impact with military members being afraid to communicate. This is another amateur move.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest guidance also comes as Congress has become increasingly frustrated with the lack of answers from the Pentagon on the US military’s operations in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said. Democrats left a briefing on Thursday furious that Defense Department lawyers  hadn’t been present  to answer basic questions about the legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth,  whose tenure  has been beleaguered by leaks, has taken a number of steps to more tighly control information since earlier this year, including barring most engagements between DoD personnel and think tanks, reporters, or other outside events and conferences. Dozens of reporters  turned in their badges  last month rather than sign a document the Pentagon had produced that included restrictions on their work.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/democrats-shutdown-politics","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Are Winning the Shutdown Politics.

Can they stop now? \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After the 2013 government shutdown ended, Republican leaders made clear they had only been humoring Sen. Ted Cruz and his plot to defund Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  “It was not a smart play. It had no chance of success,” then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  said .\n \n\n   \n  Then-House Speaker John Boehner initially said the GOP had “fought the good fight.” But he would later say the plan “ never had a chance ” and even called the Texas senator “ Lucifer in the flesh .”\n \n\n   \n  This is how shutdowns generally go. The side seeking a concession fights what they view as “the good fight,” and then they give up when it becomes clear that it’s also a losing fight. Because, as McConnell has often said, shutdowns don’t work.\n \n\n   \n  And maybe that’s how Democrats thought this one would go down. House Speaker Mike Johnson basically predicted as much Saturday, wagering Democrats might  back down after Tuesday’s elections .\n \n\n   \n  But a full month into the shutdown, it’s hard to see how Democrats can give up now. The politics of this have gone surprisingly well for them. And Republicans seem to be the ones struggling for a path forward.\n \n\n   \n  Much can change as some of the biggest impacts of the shutdown  start to hit this weekend  and in the coming weeks. But we’re in a very different kind of shutdown this time — one where it’s much tougher to see the politics forming an obvious off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The polling on blame has been remarkably constant since before the shutdown began. People continue to blame President Donald Trump and the Republicans more than Democrats by double-digit margins in most surveys. That margin was  45%-33%  in a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A  Yahoo News-YouGov poll , meanwhile, showed 46% said they blamed “conservative Republicans” a lot for the shutdown — more than the 38% who blamed “progressive Democrats” that much.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys also continue to show that Democrats’ policy demand, an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies, remains popular with more than 7 in 10 Americans.\n \n\n   \n  That Yahoo survey also suggested a problem for Republicans that we haven’t seen tested in previous polling.\n \n\n   \n  It showed Americans said by a nearly 3-to-1 margin — 63%-21% — that they disapproved of the firings of thousands of federal workers during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  This was, of course, Trump’s big threat to Democrats. He made a big show of casting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as the grim reaper ready to target Democratic employees and programs for cuts — even as some Republicans  cautioned the White House  that such cuts could squander the GOP’s political advantages. Then the administration  followed through .\n \n\n   \n  But it  doesn’t seem to have dissuaded Democrats from pressing forward. And there’s now reason to believe those Republicans had a point about these cuts backfiring on the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, much of the GOP’s handling of this seems rather haphazard. And Friday was a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  The day started with Republicans dealing with a curveball from Trump, who decided late Thursday to suddenly urge them to nuke the filibuster to end the shutdown. This completely impractical idea also  legitimized a key Democratic talking point  — that Republicans could end the shutdown any time they want.\n \n\n   \n  Then Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made a few seemingly unhelpful comments about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, also known as food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  She at one point said that if people really needed them that badly, then “ we have failed you .” House Speaker Mike Johnson soon stepped in to clarify that the “we” somehow meant, “we, the Democrats.” (Neither Rollins nor Johnson is, in fact, a Democrat.)\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Rollins was noncommittal when asked whether the administration would abide by a judge’s order for it to release emergency SNAP funds, saying, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a stunning response — not just because ignoring court orders could trigger a constitutional crisis, but also because it would mean the administration would be taking such a drastic step to prevent poor people from getting food.\n \n\n   \n  A  pair of federal judges  soon ordered the administration to release the emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits. But ahead of the rulings, Republicans did a great job making themselves out to be opposed to this — and even ready to fight against it. (Trump on Friday night ultimately indicated he  would do what he could to fund SNAP .)\n \n\n   \n  Another major factor here is what the shutdown could do for Democrats. It’s early, but there is evidence this has led to something of a badly needed rallying effect on the left.\n \n\n   \n  The reason the Democratic Party has seen some of its worst poll numbers in history this year is largely because Democrats themselves have lost faith in their party. But a  Quinnipiac University poll  last week showed 58% of Democratic voters suddenly approved of their party’s congressional contingent.\n \n\n   \n  That’s still not great. But it is up nearly 20 points from where it was between February and July, when that number hovered around 40%.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats would seem to have relatively little reason to back down — and plenty of reason to stick with their demands that Republicans come to the table on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Imagine a situation in which they have these seeming political advantages and they throw in the towel anyways. It’s not difficult to see that reigniting a backlash on the left.\n \n\n   \n  And in case that danger wasn’t clear, witness a newly released Pew Research Center poll. It asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who expressed frustration with the party what the main reason for that was. Far and away, the most-cited reason was not fighting hard enough against the Trump administration,  which 41% cited .\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a Democrat, it’s hard to look at all of that and not want to at least let things play out. You might think the  premium increases  that people are seeing on their Obamacare plans after open enrollment began Saturday could shift the politics even more in your favor. And maybe you’ve got a little more confidence in how the SNAP issue is going to play.\n \n\n   \n  You might even start to think that, at the end of this long journey, there could be something more valuable than a moral victory.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/ice-protest-arrests-illinois","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Protesters Arrested at Chicago ICE Facility: Free Speech, Safety, and Justice in Conflict","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since September 2025, protests have intensified outside the Broadview ICE facility in Chicago, driven by opposition to President Donald Trump’s intensified immigration enforcement.

Here’s what happened to them next \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As demonstrations outside an immigration enforcement facility near Chicago have ramped up over the past couple of months, so has the number of protesters being led away in restraints and facing a court date.\n \n\n   \n  Since September, protesters have rallied weekly outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview against President Donald Trump’s  intensified immigration enforcement campaign  in Chicago. Early on, federal agents guarding the building  deployed tear gas and shot pepper balls in clashes with protesters  and arrested some of them, including some  charged with felonies  on suspicion of assaulting or  blocking  officers.\n \n\n   \n  But by early October, state, county and local law enforcement officers  took a larger role  in policing the protests at the facility. These agencies have made 68 arrests in connection with Broadview protests since October 3, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said on October 28.\n \n\n   \n  The arrests sometimes expose a tension between demonstrators’ desire to exercise their constitutional free speech rights and the intention of authorities – who say some protesters have resisted their attempts to keep paths to the building clear – to let ICE agents and others travel safely to and from the facility.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to some arrested demonstrators or, in one case, a protester’s representative, to ask about their experiences in getting arrested on accusations ranging from petty to felony offenses. Here are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago woman held for hours after a crowd scuffle with police\n \n\n   \n  A’Keisha Lee was standing and chanting with a crowd of protesters near the Broadview ICE facility on October 17 when she saw a swarm of police officers hop out of police vans wearing helmets and carrying batons, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sickened,” the 30-year-old Chicago resident recalled. “And I remember feeling really scared.”\n \n\n   \n  The officers walked toward her and the other demonstrators in a “militarized fashion” and began pushing them back, she said. Video of the encounter shows Lee at the front of the crowd when officers with Illinois State Police patches on their sleeves pushed in an apparent attempt to clear them from a paved area, and some demonstrators tried to hold their ground.\n \n\n   \n  Chaos ensued. There was yelling, people falling, and some who appeared to get hurt in the scuffle, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  She was hit in the face with a baton, and wasn’t sure whether the strike was intentional, she recounted. She’d later discover a bruise on her face.\n \n\n   \n  Lee fell to the ground, and officers helped her up, according to Lee and the video, which was distributed by Reuters. An officer then detained her, putting zip ties around her wrists, she said; that moment is not shown in the Reuters video. Lee couldn’t understand why she was being arrested.\n \n\n   \n  “I was asking them to let me go,” Lee said, “and reinforcing that I hadn’t did anything I wasn’t allowed to do.”\n \n\n   \n  She was escorted to a curb to sit, and moments later placed in a police vehicle that took her to the Broadview Police Department. Lee’s mind raced as she rode in the police car. She worried about going to jail and whether the conditions would be clean and safe. She also worried about whether she’d be treated differently as a Black woman in the legal system.\n \n\n   \n  At the police station, she was booked, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell with other female protesters for about five hours before being released.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police had arrested her on two Class A misdemeanor counts of resisting a police officer – punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 – Cook County court records show. She also was cited on suspicion of disobeying a police officer, a petty offense that carries a fine. Her court appearance is scheduled for November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer details about what led to the arrest, but Lee denies resisting and says it was never made clear to her how she was disobeying police.\n \n\n   \n  “From my understanding, it was in my rights to be there,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police did not directly answer CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including Lee’s assertion that she did nothing wrong or why officers pushed back this crowd. However, they did issue a statement generally addressing the approach of the state, county and local officers who’ve been policing the protests since early October – a group they call the “Unified Command.”\n \n\n   \n  These officers in Broadview “give loud, clear, consistent, and repeated directions and commands to crowds and provide individuals numerous opportunities to comply with the law,” state police said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to note that since the establishment of the Unified Command, there have been no violent confrontations between ICE and protesters in Broadview involving the use of chemical agents, which is a significant departure from operations prior to their presence,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are  deploying tear gas  during protests in neighborhoods.\n \n\n   \n  “I think how this country has treated immigrants is one of our original transgressions,” Lee said. “And this is the first tester for what we will allow as a people.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, who works for a local nonprofit, worries about the fate of her court case; however, she stands by her decision to protest.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s always a fear of being treated like an example when these things happen,” Lee said. “But I do believe that I did not break the law.”\n \n\n   \n    He was arrested while trying to enter the ICE facility\n \n\n   \n  Sean Mills says he is not happy about how immigrants have been treated since the Trump administration started aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility. He shows up every Friday and Saturday – sometimes wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders – and joins other protesters outside the facility.   \n \n\n   \n  But on October 17, Mills was arrested for the first time in his life, he said, after he tried to enter the building. Mills had become increasingly concerned with  claims by local activists  that the facility’s conditions were inhumane. So, Mills wanted to view the building’s interior himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I just had the urge to walk over and test my luck,” Mills said. “I walked over to see if I could investigate as a citizen and enter the facility to ask questions and document.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers surrounded Mills near the facility’s entrance, and one told him he was not allowed inside, Mills said. That same officer told Mills to “go back immediately” or be arrested, according to Mills.   \n \n\n   \n  “I tried to explain myself a little bit further,” Mills said, adding he told the officers he was a concerned citizen who wanted to go inside. “And I think about five or 10 seconds later, he (the officer) said ‘OK, you’re under arrest.’”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was shocked because he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong. He also felt the officers had not given him enough time to explain himself before restraining his hands with what he believes were zip ties.\n \n\n   \n  Three other protesters who also were trying to enter the building were arrested, he recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just an over-policing example, because I walked up there with my hands out to my side, declared myself very openly, and said I’d like to enter the facility,” Mills said. “One hundred percent it was just to show an example of us.”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was escorted to a nearby curb, where he waited roughly 10 minutes for a police van that took him to the Broadview police station, where he was processed and given a citation, he recounted.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police cited him on suspicion of disobeying a police officer – a petty offense punishable by a fine – Cook County court records show, and is scheduled to appear in court November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer a narrative of the arrest. State police did not directly respond to CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including about Mills’ claim that he did nothing wrong. Instead, they provided the same general statement they gave for Lee’s arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Mills has no regrets protesting and getting arrested because he’s standing up for his beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a shame that us peaceful protesters are being targeted instead of being encouraged to exercise our First Amendment rights,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Mills objects to law enforcement officers being able to stop and ask people about their immigration status based at least in part on their  apparent ethnicity . A US Supreme Court ruling in a California case last month  appeared to clear the way  for a person’s ethnicity to be a  factor  behind immigration stops by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Mills also does not support ICE’s roundups throughout Chicago of people accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  “We are doing the least that we can do to keep our neighbors safe, which is so important to us right now,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n    School cafeteria worker tackled after threatening agents, authorities say\n \n\n   \n  Paul Ivery is a Chicago-area man with an intellectual disability who works at a high school cafeteria and admires and respects the police and first responders in his community – even saluting officers when he passes them – people who know him say.\n \n\n   \n  So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.\n \n\n   \n  The case would draw numerous supporters, including his own mayor, to one of Ivery’s court hearings in an attempt to persuade a judge he wasn’t a threat. Ivery declined to be interviewed for this story, but a family representative, court filings and bystander video help chronicle a case that the government wanted prosecuted one moment but dismissed the next.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery would later tell investigators he was there to “protest against ICE” because he believed that “ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,”  a criminal complaint filed against Ivery in federal court said,  without elaborating on his motivation.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was also upset that federal agents had been  deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at protesters  at Broadview, according to Sakiwama.\n \n\n   \n  At some point during the protest, Ivery approached a US Border Patrol agent and shouted something at him, according to the  complaint . While the agent couldn’t recall what was said, Ivery would admit to investigators later that he said, “I’ll (expletive) kill you right now,” and, “do something,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  After the shout, Ivery ran and jumped on top of an occupied vehicle as agents chased him, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander shows Ivery jumping off the vehicle, and an agent tackling him as he hits the pavement. Ivery yells as several agents restrain him. Nearby, other agents fire chemical irritants into the ground to keep bystanders away, appearing to cause some people to cough, the video shows . \n \n\n   \n  An onlooker asks Ivery for his name. Ivery yells it and says, “Help me!” Minutes later, after agents tied his hands behind his back and sat him up, an agent helps Ivery drink from a water bottle. Ivery is eventually pulled to his feet and led into the back of an unmarked vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  The complaint alleges that as agents were restraining Ivery, he grabbed an agent’s helmet and pulled it down, hurting the agent’s chin and exposing the agent to pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was arrested and  charged  in federal court with felony assault on a federal officer, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was held for several days. But by October 1, prosecutors asked to have him released from jail and put on house arrest pending trial, acknowledging his disability,  CNN affiliate WLS-TV reported .\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing that day, a judge released Ivery on his own recognizance. Many of Ivery’s supporters, including Oak Park Mayor Vicki Scaman, were there to back him,  according to WLS .\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the judge, Scaman said Ivery is a “valued member of our community” who stops and salutes police when he sees them on the street. She wrote that Ivery is not a threat to the community, and she hoped the judge would consider Ivery’s “special needs diagnosis.”\n \n\n   \n  On October 9, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge altogether, and the judge ordered the dismissal the next day. The court records did not say why the case was dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney’s office for Illinois’ northern district did not respond to CNN’s request for information about the dismissal. Ivery’s court-appointed attorney declined to be interviewed about the specifics of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy for Mr. Ivery and the just resolution of his case and hope that others who are also having their First Amendment rights trampled by the government receive justice as well,” Ivery’s attorney and federal public defender Johanathan Brooks said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Bill Kirkos and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"UK train stabbing attack leaves two people fighting for their lives.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:47 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain was shocked by a  mass stabbing attack  on a train Saturday evening, targeting passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London in an incident Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described as “deeply concerning.”\n \n\n   \n  Nine people were left with life-threatening injuries, two of whom were still fighting for their lives in hospital on Sunday, as the British Transport Police declared a “major incident.”\n \n\n   \n  Two suspected attackers were detained within minutes of police receiving their first emergency call, as the train made an emergency stop at Huntingdon station.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have now confirmed they are two British-born males in their 30s. Police are working to determine a motive but say there is no evidence to suggest the attack is terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the stabbing attack.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6.25 p.m. local time on Saturday evening, bound for London.\n \n\n   \n  The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train’s toilets, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.\n \n\n   \n  Police received their first emergency call at approximately 7.42 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within eight minutes of the first emergency call, the two suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned, emergency stop at Huntingdon station.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralise any ongoing threat, British news agency PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  One eyewitness, who gave his name as Gavin, described one of the suspects being struck down by a police Taser. “Essentially, as they got closer to him, started shouting, like, ‘get down get down’… I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News.\n \n\n   \n  The trauma-stricken train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. 10 people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Sunday morning, two people remained fighting for their lives, British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about the victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    Who is behind the attack?\n \n\n   \n  Two suspects were arrested on Saturday evening, on suspicion of attempted murder. In an update on Sunday, police revealed both are British nationals in their 30s.\n \n\n   \n  One is a 32-year-old, Black British national, while the other is a 35-year-old British national of Caribbean descent, according to Superintendent Loveless.\n \n\n   \n  Both were born in the UK, he added. They remained in separate police stations for questioning on Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Police are still working to establish a motive, but say there is no indication it was terror-related. “At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” Loveless said. “At this stage, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident.”\n \n\n   \n  British defense secretary John Healey described the incident as an “isolated attack” in a Sky News interview.\n \n\n   \n  BTP had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding it.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offences were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/andrew-sandringham-estate-explained-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-05:00","title":"What we know about Sandringham, Andrew’s new home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has been formally stripped of his royal titles and military rank following public outrage over allegations of his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre’s claims of sexual trafficking.

The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew’s elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That’s because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process.\n \n\n   \n   Sandringham  was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year.\n \n\n   \n    Christmas family tradition\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England’s east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website.\n \n\n   \n  The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II’s first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way.\n \n\n   \n  The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities.\n \n\n   \n  King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II’s father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.”\n \n\n   \n  The property’s gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate’s management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations.\n \n\n   \n    So where might Andrew live?\n \n\n   \n  No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother.\n \n\n   \n   York Cottage , previously known as Bachelor’s Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals.\n \n\n   \n   Gardens House  is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate’s head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads.\n \n\n   \n   The Folly  is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing.\n \n\n   \n   Park House  is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n \n\n   \n   Wood Farm  is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew’s parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up.\n \n\n   \n  Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is  Anmer Hall,  which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the move happening now?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Public fury was compounded after the publication of a  posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre  in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy’s reputation further.\n \n\n   \n  His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King’s actions to remove Andrew’s titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes in all of this. We should never forget that,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will also lose his last remaining military rank as vice admiral of the Royal Navy at the request of King Charles III, British defense minister John Healey told the BBC on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    And who will pay for relocation?\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham House and its extensive surrounding estate have been handed down through the generations and is privately owned by the sovereign.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, Andrew’s current home in Windsor is part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state.\n \n\n   \n  It is understood that the disgraced royal will move to an undisclosed property, with the relocation privately financed by Charles, who will also make financial provisions for his sibling.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is also moving from Royal Lodge but she will make her own living arrangements and is not expected to join Andrew at Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  The two Pembroke Welsh corgis,  Muick and Sandy, that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth II  will remain in the care of Andrew’s family, Buckingham Palace confirmed to Britain’s PA Media news agency on Friday. However, the palace did not specify if the dogs would stay with Ferguson, head to Norfolk with Andrew or be passed on to their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/us-strikes-drug-boat-caribbean-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"02:39:00-04:00","title":"US military strikes another alleged drug-trafficking boat in the Caribbean, killing 3","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military conducted a lethal strike in the Caribbean Sea, killing three people aboard an alleged drug-trafficking vessel, continuing a month-long campaign initiated by the Trump administration.

\nUpdated: \n        2:39 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military carried out another  deadly strike on alleged drug-traffickers  at sea on Saturday, continuing a monthslong campaign by the Trump administration that has been widely criticized as likely illegal.\n \n\n   \n  The latest strike targeted a boat in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said three men, whom he identified as “narco-terrorists,” were killed in the operation, which he said was carried out in international waters. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  The boat was “carrying narcotics” and “transiting along a known narco-trafficking route,” Hegseth said, citing US intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s attack marks the 15th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the Trump administration began the operations in early September. The strikes, which have been carried out in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, have killed a total of 64 people.\n \n\n   \n  “These narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home—and they will not succeed. The Department will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda,” Hegseth said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s strike is the first targeting a boat in the Caribbean since October 24. After concentrating on the region initially, the Pentagon in recent weeks deliberately refocused its efforts against suspected drug traffickers to the eastern Pacific,  CNN reported  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The shift was made because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter. Six known strikes have been carried out in the Pacific over the last two weeks, including three conducted in a single day last week.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in Congress and international leaders have questioned the legality of the Trump administration’s accelerating strikes.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the strikes  violate international law  and called for them to stop.\n \n\n   \n  “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats,” human rights commissioner Volker Türk said, according to a statement released by his office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers,  CNN previously reported . The opinion argues that the president is allowed to authorize deadly force against a broad range of cartels because they pose an imminent threat to Americans.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of lacking transparency about the strikes. A  closed-door briefing Thursday  lacked critical details and Pentagon lawyers were pulled from the session at the last minute, Democrats asserted last week.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner blasted the Trump administration for holding a briefing that day on the strikes but  not telling Democrats about it , calling the move “a partisan stunt.”\n \n\n   \n  While traveling in Asia on Friday, Hegseth insisted he had engaged Congress on a bipartisan basis regarding the strikes. However, that same day, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, a Republican, and Ranking Member Jack Reed, a Democrat, released two letters they said they sent Hegseth over the past month seeking details about the operations but that have gone unanswered.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, Kaanita Iyer, and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/tech/saudi-arabia-ai-powerhouse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in artificial intelligence through its homegrown company Humain, a key initiative under its Vision 2030 economic transformation.

massive AI ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Its chief investment vehicle is Humain, a homegrown company that is building out a full stack of data centers, cloud capabilities, large language models and applications. It’s owned by the Kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.\n \n\n   \n  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman  unveiled Humain in May  ahead of President Donald Trump’s  state visit to Riyadh . This week, at the annual Future Investment Initiative in the same location, the scale, ambition and deep pockets behind the project came into clearer focus.\n \n\n   \n  Humain CEO, Tareq Amin, is setting out to make Saudi Arabia the world’s third-largest AI market, after the United States and China. It’s a bold ambition for a newcomer to the industry, but Amin argues the Kingdom’s competitive edge lies in its abundant and cheap energy resources that can feed the seemingly insatiable demand for computing power.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an advantage in Saudi Arabia,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “Look at this country’s amazing energy grid that doesn’t require a company like Humain to build the substations and the power to deliver that to a data center. That means I have saved 18 months of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Humain plans to build up to six gigawatts in data center capability across the country by 2034, with a rolodex of key AI partners, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon Web Services, Qualcomm and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Humain announced a  $3 billion deal  with private equity giant Blackstone to build data centers in the Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  It also publicly launched  Humain One , an AI-powered operating system where users speak or type to a computer to tell it to perform tasks, rather than clicking on icons, as is conventional in systems like Windows or iOS.\n \n\n   \n  Humain has been using the AI system internally to run much of its HR, finance, legal, operational and IT departments. Amin says there is now only one employee in his payroll department, with AI agents handling the rest.\n \n\n   \n  The Kingdom is entering the closing stretch of its Vision 2030 economic transformation plan facing headwinds from declining oil prices and delays in its construction of giga-projects like Neom, placing new urgency on its AI push to support the growth of the Arab world’s largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  It also  faces competition  from the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which has its own AI vehicle, G42, and recently secured a landmark deal with the Trump administration to build “ Stargate UAE ,” a sprawling $500 billion data center project billed as the largest outside the United States, with the help of OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether there’s room for two regional heavyweights, Amin said he supports democratizing AI, while touting Humain’s robust operations.\n \n\n   \n  “It is good for humanity to have knowledge — especially around AI — not to be all centralized in one location. So it’s good what is happening in the UAE. It’s very good what’s happening in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “I will tell you what we decided to do, which is very different … Humane is not a holding company. We are an operating company.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/what-to-know-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Tuesday’s key races: What to know about the NYC election and other contests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Tuesday, key state elections across the U.S. — including New York City, New Jersey, Virginia, California, and Texas — are shaping political narratives in the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency. In NYC, progressive Zohran Mamdani faces off against former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Silwa, signaling a shift in Democratic party dynamics. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, endorsed by Trump, challenges Democrat Mikie Sherrill, with utility costs and the Gateway Tunnel cancellation as central issues. In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger opposes Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, who is tied to Trump and focused on transgender policies. In California, voters decide on Proposition 50, which would allow the Democratic-led redistricting plan to take effect, countering Texas's Republican gerrymandering.

Andrew Cuomo , who is attempting a political comeback as an independent, and Republican Curtis Silwa in a mayoral race with significant implications for the future of the city and the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  And in California, the race to redraw  congressional district boundaries  ahead of next year’s battle for majority control of the US House of Representatives faces a critical moment.\n \n\n   \n  A special election in Texas caps an important set of odd-year elections. Here are the races and issues to watch Tuesday:\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Cuomo are facing off a second time in the New York City mayoral election, after Mamdani — a  democratic socialist  who has energized young voters and progressives with his go-anywhere, do-anything campaign tactics and a message centered on affordability — handily defeated the former governor in the Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor’s race is a signal moment for a Democratic Party looking for its way out of the political wilderness. Similar dynamics — progressives against moderates and insiders against outsiders — could play out in primary elections next spring. Democrats can also draw lessons from how questions of  support for Israel  have played in the race, and from Mamdani’s approach to social media and publicity, including appearing on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  Some national Democrats — most notably the party’s top two figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York — have been slow to embrace Mamdani. Jeffries  endorsed him  only in late October, and Schumer has not said who he is supporting in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Before  heading out to rallies  in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, former President Barack Obama called Mamdani. He has not endorsed the nominee — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections — and that did not change in the call. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Across the Hudson River, voters in the traditionally blue state of New Jersey will choose their replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n  Amid tax hikes and soaring utility costs, affordability has taken center stage in the election. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who is endorsed by Trump and has praised the president’s performance in his second term, has sought to localize the race —  pitching himself  as the consummate “Jersey guy” and casting Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who moved to the state after a Navy career, as an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Democrats, meanwhile, have emphasized Ciattarelli’s links to Trump — a potentially decisive factor in a state with 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. One point of emphasis: Trump’s cancellation of funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project linking New Jersey and New York City.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey has typically leaned blue, but Ciattarelli came close to winning in 2021, and the state shifted hard in Trump’s direction in 2024: He lost by just 6 percentage points, after a 16-point drubbing there in 2020.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won a major upset, tapping into parents’ anger over local school boards, his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is seeking to replace him with a campaign centered on transgender policies, particularly in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But polls suggest her Democratic opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has a clear advantage headed into Election Day in a state that three times voted against Trump. Democrats have relentlessly tied Earle-Sears to Trump, and she has not sought to distance herself from the president.\n \n\n   \n  At a rally with Obama in Norfolk on Saturday, Spanberger described the election as a chance for Democrats to send a signal to the nation. “Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  None of the states holding elections on Tuesday are typically considered swing states in presidential elections. But Republicans were able to sweep statewide races four years ago. And with the Virginia’s proximity to Washington, it is home to hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who are affected by the Trump administration’s downsizing of the federal workforce and the government shutdown. Its gubernatorial election might be the closest to a true test of Trump’s performance this year.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown closer races down ballot in Virginia, where Republican John Reid and Democrat Ghazala Hashmi are facing off for lieutenant governor. In the contest for attorney general, Republicans have what could be their best chance to win Tuesday as GOP incumbent Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been  dogged by controversy  surrounding violent text messages he sent in 2022.\n \n\n   \n    Issue to watch: Utility costs\n \n\n   \n  The economy is a perennial campaign issue, with voters often expressing concerns about prices at the grocery store or at gas pumps. This year’s pocketbook metric is one less often discussed:  utility costs .\n \n\n   \n  Electricity prices across the country, which have  sharply increased  since 2020, have jumped over the last year, introducing a new financial strain for voters in places like New Jersey and Virginia. Candidates in both states have featured energy costs in their television ads and campaign speeches.\n \n\n   \n  Utility costs have become a particularly salient issue in New Jersey, where residential electricity prices have jumped nearly 21% over the past year compared with a 6% increase nationwide, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Ciattarelli has said Democrats’ push for clean energy is to blame, while Sherrill has said she will fix the issue by freezing utility rates, a proposal that has drawn skepticism from Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump appears to be aware of the political potency of the issue. In a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last month, the president repeatedly turned to talking about energy costs — an indication the issue could be front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    California’s redistricting battle\n \n\n   \n  California’s vote on  a measure known as Proposition 50  will set the stage for next year’s midterm battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will decide whether to green-light the Democratic plan spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside the congressional districts drawn by the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission in favor of a gerrymandered map aimed at improving Democrats’ chances of winning five GOP-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a response to Texas, where the legislature approved and Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law new maps intended to help Republicans win five more seats — improving the party’s odds of retaining its House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, sought an answer that would neutralize those Texas gains. But unlike in Texas, California voters have to sign off on the plan to replace the nonpartisan commission’s maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections — before switching back to new, commission-drawn maps in the next decade, after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  A “yes” vote would be a big win for Democrats, who have fewer avenues to respond after Republicans also redrew Missouri’s maps to add one more seat, with Indiana convening a special legislative session on Monday to potentially add one or two more GOP seats and North Carolina moving to add one more Republican-leaning district. It would also be a milestone for Newsom, as he and a slew of other Democratic governors seek to position themselves as Trump’s strongest opponents ahead of potential presidential runs.\n \n\n   \n    Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, voters must determine whether to keep three Democratic members of the state Supreme Court — a decision with potentially  significant ramifications  in the coming months and years in the crucial presidential battleground.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the state’s high court. The three incumbents on Tuesday’s ballot face yes-or-no questions of whether they’ll be retained for new 10-year terms. If they aren’t, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would appoint interim replacements until elections for new justices were held in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  A change in party control of the state Supreme Court could have far-reaching implications for the 2028 presidential race, upcoming midterms and future redistricting. Ahead of the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Democratic majority sided with Democrats on key cases related to mail-in deadlines, provisional ballots and signature matching.\n \n\n   \n    Texas House special election\n \n\n   \n  The largely Democratic, Houston-area 18th Congressional District in Texas has been without representation in Washington for most of the last 16 months.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024,  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  died. Her daughter, Erica Lee Carter, won the special election to fill the vacancy. But that special election was held the same day as the 2024 general election, which was won by former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner — who hadn’t been on the ballot in the special election.\n \n\n   \n  Turner  died in early March . Abbott, a Republican, scheduled the special election for eight months later — a move that gave the House GOP more breathing room as it moved toward passage of Trump’s landmark tax and domestic policy bill.\n \n\n   \n  This special election, a jungle primary that will go to a runoff featuring the top two finishers unless one tops 50% of the vote on Tuesday, has drawn several high-profile candidates. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, who has technically resigned to run for Congress but continues to serve, is among the Democrats, as are state Rep. Jolanda Jones and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member who lost in the 2024 primary to Jackson Lee. Republican Carmen Montiel, a Venezuelan American real estate agent and former TV journalist, is the highest-profile member of her party in the race.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/americas/mexico-sonora-fire-dozens-killed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:57:00-04:00","title":"Fire at general store kills at least 23 in northern Mexico, state governor says","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire at a Waldo’s general store in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora state in northern Mexico, has killed at least 23 people, including minors, with 11 injured and being treated in local hospitals.

While some progressive Jews and Jewish Democratic leaders such as Brad Lander and Jerry Nadler endorse him, others—including Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove and over 1,100 rabbis—express deep concern that his views threaten Jewish security. Polls show a majority of Jewish likely voters still support Andrew Cuomo, indicating that many prioritize city-level policies like rent control and affordability over Israel-related positions.

11:30 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As a Jew and a New Yorker, Norman Needleman said he finds the city’s mayoral election “painful.”\n \n\n   \n  Waiting in line Friday to vote on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, the 77-year-old Needleman thought Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, would be good for the city’s social needs. But his positions on Israel were just too much for Needleman to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “If I try and bend that far, I’ll break,” he said, quoting the musical “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n \n\n   \n  His comments reflect what has been a fraught debate, among Jews in New York and elsewhere, ahead of the city’s mayoral election Tuesday. Jewish voters have long reliably  supported Democrats , and Mamdani won the Democratic primary, but concerns about rising antisemitism and Mamdani’s sharp criticisms of Israel have opened up a generational split and raised deeper questions what it means to be an American Jew in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This election has shown clearly that “Jews and Jewish voters are not a monolith,” said Phylisa Wisdom, the director of the New York Jewish Agenda, an advocacy group promoting liberal Jewish New Yorkers.\n \n\n   \n  “Folks have been really trying to reckon with how much does it matter that they have a mayor that has their same feelings about Israel,” she said. “There are some who feel like it’s not the most important thing to me when I’m voting for mayor, how they feel about Israel, and there are some who think it’s existential, and they couldn’t vote for someone who disagrees with them on Israel or doesn’t support Israel as a Jewish state.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue stems from Mamdani’s history of pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activism, from his college days when he started a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, to his support for the  Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement  against Israel, to his pledge to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  In more recent months, Mamdani has tempered some of his most controversial positions and tried to reassure Jewish voters worried about antisemitic attacks like the ones in  Washington, DC , and  Boulder, Colorado . Democratic Jewish politicians like City Comptroller  Brad Lander  and Rep.  Jerry Nadler  have endorsed him, though US Sen. Chuck Schumer remains a notable holdout.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has been convinced.\n \n\n   \n  “Shabbat Shalom. To be clear, unequivocal, and on the record: I believe Zohran Mamdani poses a danger to the security of the New York Jewish community,”  Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove  of Park Avenue Synagogue told his congregation on October 18.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,100 rabbis and Jewish leaders across the US soon  signed an open letter  agreeing with Cosgrove’s message and calling on Americans to “stand up for candidates who reject antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s rise comes amid a growing split in the American Jewish electorate, particularly along age lines, about Israel in the wake of the war in Gaza the last two years. While 56% of Jewish Americans say they are emotionally attached to Israel, that number falls to 36% among those aged 18 to 34, according to polling from  The Washington Post .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a tense time in the Jewish family group chats,” Ezra Klein wrote in  The New York Times  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  While Mamdani is ahead among likely voters in most public polls, recent polls from  Fox News  and  Marist  both had 55% of Jewish likely voters in the city backing former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running an independent campaign after losing to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary. Mamdani had 32% with Jewish voters in each poll.\n \n\n   \n  For voters like Cosgrove, Mamdani’s position on Israel is a dealbreaker. Others, like those in the progressive activist group  Jewish Voices for Peace , see it as a positive. Still many other Jews see Mamdani’s views on Israel as less important than his other proposed policies: freezing increases on the city’s rent-stabilized apartments, focusing on affordability and standing up to President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Not to mention Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa have their own drawbacks.\n \n\n   \n  “I hate my choices,” said Cydney Schwartz, a 33-year-old liberal Democrat who has lived in Israel.\n \n\n   \n    What Mamdani has said about Israel and Jews\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel advocacy have been a key throughline of his political beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has declined to say he believes Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state, saying the country should provide equal rights to all residents. He previously refused to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” referencing an Arabic term used by Palestinians to describe their uprising against Israel. He has recently said he  would discourage the use  of the phrase.\n \n\n   \n  A day after the  October 7, 2023 , Hamas attacks on Israel, which sparked the devastating war in Gaza,  Mamdani issued  a statement that did not condemn Hamas or the attacks. He has repeatedly criticized Israel’s actions as a “ genocide ” and said he would arrest Netanyahu if he visits New York, citing a warrant from the  International Criminal Court , of which the US is not a member.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, a September 2023 video of him connecting New York Police Department oppression to the Israel Defense Forces spread widely online.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,”  he said  then at a Democratic Socialists of America convention.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about that line last week, he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF.”\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No. What I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, after his victory in the Democratic primary, he pledged to “understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.”\n \n\n   \n  During Rosh Hashanah, Mamdani attended services at Kolot Chayeinu, one of Brooklyn’s most progressive synagogues. For Yom Kippur, considered the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Mamdani attended services at Lab Shul, a non-denominational Jewish congregation, accompanied by Jewish political allies in Nadler and Lander.\n \n\n   \n  He has met with Hasidic leaders, including two prominent rabbis from Williamsburg’s Satmar community, an ultra-Orthodox sect with its own set of demands for city government.\n \n\n   \n  He has promised he would keep in place police protection for the city’s annual parade honoring Israel. And he has said  he would not have an Israel-related  litmus test for working in his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to have people in my administration who are Zionists,” he said, according to  The Free Press .\n \n\n   \n    How Jewish New Yorkers feel\n \n\n   \n  “Two Jews, three opinions,” goes the old joke, a play on the religion’s tradition of debate, and that was evident in conversations with liberal Jews voting for mayor Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re figuring it out,” Wisdom said. “There’s a lot of out-loud figuring it out.”\n \n\n   \n  Schwartz, the 33-year-old liberal who has lived in Israel, said she feels a powerful connection to the country. Still, she said, she didn’t agree with Israel’s politics or Netanyahu, similarly to how she disagrees with Trump’s politics in the US.\n \n\n   \n  She considered not voting, but ultimately picked a candidate, who she declined to share. “I want to focus on the city I live in,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  David, a 29-year-old wearing a yarmulke who declined to give his last name, said the vote felt like an “existential” decision. He said he didn’t particularly care about how the mayor feels about Israel, but Mamdani’s focus on Israeli-Palestinian politics made it hard to believe he’s not antisemitic, and he worried whether that could bleed into other policies.\n \n\n   \n  He said he planned to vote for Cuomo “reluctantly.” “He’s bad on everything,” David said of his preferred choice. “He’s a bad person.”\n \n\n   \n  Eric Weltman, a 58-year-old wearing a suit and tie, proudly said he voted for Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s smart, competent, principled and progressive,” he said, adding he had no qualms about Mamdani’s positions on Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s going to be mayor of New York, not ambassador to Israel,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As for Needleman, the 77-year-old who quoted “Fiddler,” he said he couldn’t support Mamdani and felt Cuomo was too dishonest. So he decided to vote for Sliwa even though he disagreed with the Republican’s politics, saying Sliwa seemed like a “decent guy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/middleeast/motaz-azaizas-gaza-war-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-04:00","title":"Motaz Azaiza’s photos from Gaza showed the heartbreak of war.

Now in the US, he’s looking for a way forward \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Motaz Azaiza has witnessed the horrors of war. Now he’s trying to restore his faith in humanity. For 107 days, he was a photojournalist on the front lines of a warzone in his own familiar neighborhoods, documenting the carnage wrought by relentless Israeli airstrikes in such raw and unedited detail that it was impossible to ignore.\n \n\n   \n  Since mainstream news organizations were unable to film inside Gaza, Azaiza, like other Palestinian journalists in the strip, recorded the early days of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two years, more than 68,000 people have been killed, according to local health officials in the enclave, and with over 90% of the residential buildings destroyed, most of the population has been internally displaced.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza knows that he’s lucky to be alive. “My life is worth more now than if I was dead,” he told CNN earlier this month. “A lot of Gazans got killed. Nobody mentions their names.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 21 months since Azaiza escaped with his immediate family to Qatar; he’s now living in New York. He’s been working with aid groups to help the people of Gaza, and says he has raised $60 million and saved numerous lives. He recently launched a foundation to continue fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza, saying it will help to provide food and pastries, tanker trucks of clean water, blankets and shelter. “A candle in the darkness” is how he describes the Motaz Foundation to his Instagram followers, encouraging those in need to personally reach out for help.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at a recent event at the Muslim Wellness Center in Roswell, Georgia, why he named it after himself, he said that he simply couldn’t think of anything else to call it. But he’s proud of the work and it’s giving him purpose as he works through the traumatic upheaval of his life.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe this makes me forget the mental suffering that I’m in,” he pondered, leaning on the back of a pickup truck behind a Yemeni coffee shop which had just hosted a fundraising event for the foundation. “The moment I wire funds to people and get aid, support, and food, I feel high!” As he navigates a maelstrom of emotions, both his torment and his exhilaration are evident. “I’ve never been a useless person,” he said, “I’m always trying to be useful at every step.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 240 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attack, in which more than 1,200 were killed and about 250 taken hostage, prompting Israel’s fierce military response. Israel denies targeting reporters, but Gaza has become the deadliest conflict zone ever for them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he was receiving death threats via anonymous phone calls shortly before he left the strip and he knows that his story could easily have ended there. Does coming so close to death make him feel more alive? It’s complicated. “Yeah,” he responds, “because you don’t have anything to lose.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he has lost countless friends in Gaza. But he also feels as though he is dead inside. “My soul is turned off,” he said. Sometimes he felt lucky to survive – and luckier to escape – wrestling even now with survivors’ guilt, as do others who managed to flee the war  or  have witnessed it unfold from afar. “This is the feeling that people want me to feel,” he explains. “Or Israel wants me to feel, because if they defeat you inside then they don’t need to do anything else. I have it, but I’m trying not to allow it to control (me).”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he always wanted to be a photographer, but if violence hadn’t beaten a path to his door, then he would never have sought it out. He preferred taking artistic shots of bustling marketplaces or kids playing on the beach and resented that the outside world only seemed to be interested in paying for his work when he and Gaza’s other photojournalists competed for images depicting the most visceral scenes of the aftermath of an airstrike. His documentation of Israel’s response to the October 7 attack delivered him a massive social media following and professional success – his photo from October 31, 2023 of a woman trapped in a pancaked apartment building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was recognized as one of Time magazine’s  top 10 photographs of the year . But unlike his industry peers in other countries, he couldn’t celebrate the achievement because only his community’s extreme suffering had given him the opportunity to succeed.\n \n\n   \n    Dreams of war\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he feels that, somehow, fate chose him to be a bridge between the carnage in Gaza and the world outside, and he confides now that he foresaw his future many times before the war. Azaiza  would often dream of running through the streets in a press vest, a building next to him would blow up and he would bang his head on the ground before waking up, he said. The dream made no sense to him. “And then I found myself in the vest,” he said, “in the helmet, in the car (passing) the building that I saw in my dream. It was on fire. A lot of things that I imagined happened.”\n \n\n   \n  A young lady stood up to address him during one of the fundraising events in Georgia. “Thank you for opening our eyes,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she wiped tears from her cheeks. “Thank you for being alive, for being here. I’m so grateful for you.” Another man stood and hailed him a hero. “I’m not a hero,” Azaiza deflected, “I’m not Superman. I still have to wait in line for the toilet.”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza never wanted to be famous and, although he has more than 15 million followers on Instagram, he says that he’s the same man he was on October 6, 2023, just with more pressure on his shoulders. He’s learned the hard way that it’s impossible to stay out of politics when it comes to Gaza, where so many competing factions have their own agendas to promote; some of the people who used to applaud him now envy him and troll him with abuse on social media instead, he said. The hateful words are in some ways worse than the bullets, he said, because at least one knows how a bullet will hurt.\n \n\n   \n  “But this,” he paused for emphasis, “eats you from the inside, makes your heart tight, makes your stomach not able to eat, makes you overthink. And it hurts others around you, hurts your mom. The keyboard warriors, this is how Israel (can) win. They don’t need to divide us, we’re already divided.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s grateful for the ceasefire, and an end to the killing, but he doesn’t think it’s fair to the Palestinians. “I just wanted the genocide to stop,” he explained. “We’ve been calling for it to stop since October 9. Give them (Israel) the hostages. But nobody listened to us until we lost it all.\n \n\n   \n  “Now it sounds like peace that is giving Israel more peace and more power, they got what they wanted after the massacre, the whole strip. Maybe it’s going to last, because, like, there’s nothing left.”\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, echoing the findings of other genocide experts and human rights groups, all of which Israel has rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Azaiza is focused on his humanitarian work but living in a kind of limbo. He dreams of returning to Gaza to build a home by the sea but wonders what kind of life he would be returning to. He says he’d like to be Gaza’s Minister of Youth one day but knows that many politicians become corrupt; he’d love to start a family too.\n \n\n   \n  Most of all, he dreams of working with his camera in a simpler life. “You know Tarzan?” he asked rhetorically. “I want to be Tarzan with a camera. I wish to go to Tanzania with my camera, capture lions and animals. I don’t want to capture any human anymore, humans bring problems, bring pain, and bring troubles. No humans anymore, only animals, that’s it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/trump-pentagon-nigeria-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he’s ordered Pentagon to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump announced he has ordered the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action in Nigeria, citing alleged mass slaughter of Christians and accusing the Nigerian government of failing to protect religious minorities.

Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country of more than 230 million people. The violence in the country is driven by varying factors: some incidents are religiously motivated and affect both groups, while others arise from disputes between farmers and herders over limited resources, as well as communal and ethnic tensions.\n \n\n   \n  Although Christians are among those targeted, local reports indicate that most victims are Muslims living in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” Trump wrote. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!”\n \n\n   \n  “Yes sir,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted on social media with a screenshot of Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria — and anywhere — must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s announcement comes after he accused Nigeria of religious freedom violations on Friday, claiming that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and designating the nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post after the designation, but before Trump’s mention of the military, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu  wrote : “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that Nigeria is “working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths.”\n \n\n   \n  Tinubu’s press secretary, responding to a social media post from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemning the “slaughter of thousands of Christians,” called the characterization “a gross exaggeration of the Nigerian situation,” adding that “Christians, Muslims, churches and mosques are attacked randomly.”\n \n\n   \n  “What our country requires from America is military support to fight these violent extremists in some states of our country, not designation as a nation of particular concern,” said Bayo Onanuga.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespersons for the White House and Tinubu’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/harvard-university-goldenson-explosion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:21:00-04:00","title":"Officials investigate 'intentional' explosion at Harvard University medical building that left no injuries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparent intentional explosion occurred at Harvard University’s Goldenson medical building early on November 1, 2025, prompting an immediate response from Harvard University Police and the FBI Boston Division.

judges require Trump administration to use emergency funds to partially cover food stamp benefits \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:40 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover  food stamp benefits  for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, President Donald Trump said he has instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred, in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, McConnell wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If the agency chooses this option, it must make the full payment by the end of Monday, as making the full payment is simpler than calculating partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/nypd-nyc-mayoral-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:22:00-11:01","title":"Hotly Contested Mayoral Election Isn’t Just About the Candidates.

The NYPD’s future is also at stake \n       \n  By Mark Morales, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:22 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With the  high-stakes New York mayoral contest  hanging in the balance, the largest police department in the country may find itself caught between the promise of reform and the stability that followed a couple of scandal-scarred years.\n \n\n   \n  If  Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani  wins the election, his choice to lead the NYPD through a period of political transition is already in the job: current Commissioner Jessica Tisch.\n \n\n   \n  While Tisch has managed to earn praise from representatives from both political parties as well as business leaders, her stance on various key issues, from the use of the NYPD’s gang database to the deployment of a specialized unit that responds to protests and major events, stands in opposition to what Mamdani has promised during the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Despite their stark differences in policing strategies, Mamdani has said each hire he makes for his new administration would be in lock step with his vision for the future. Tisch has declined to publicly address the prospect of staying on as police commissioner, but Mamdani has said he is confident she would accept the position, leaving former police officials and advocates to wonder how both would coexist.\n \n\n   \n  While the New York City police commissioner technically answers to and is appointed by the mayor, a savvy police executive can always carve out some autonomy despite an administration’s reform promises.\n \n\n   \n  “She has leverage over him at the moment, and leverage in the sense of negotiating,” former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said of Tisch, a former sanitation department commissioner. “I think she would be willing to stay if some of her conditions, whatever they may be, be met.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani officially announced his intention to keep Tisch as commissioner from a debate stage on October 22.\n \n\n   \n  “I make the decision to retain Commissioner Tisch not only to build on the results that we’ve seen under her tenure, but also to deliver on the agenda that I’ve been running on,” Mamdani told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Tisch said she was staying out of the fray.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve said many times, it is not appropriate for the Police Commissioner to be directly involved or to seem to be involved in electoral politics,” Tisch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    Flashback to over a decade ago\n \n\n   \n  Public safety has been a major issue in the hotly contested mayor’s race that pits Democratic socialist Mamdani against former New York Gov. and  independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  and the  Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa . Cuomo and Sliwa each have said they would keep Tisch as police commissioner.\n \n\n   \n  Judging by the early voting numbers,  New Yorkers are already flocking to the polls .\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the course of the campaign,  Mamdani has moderated some of his most controversial stances  on policing, distancing himself from a previous call to defund the police and apologizing for calling police officers “racist” and “wicked.”\n \n\n   \n  Bratton, an experienced police executive who ran the NYPD twice, was in a similar position in which Tisch may find herself when he came back for the second time during the start of Bill de Blasio’s administration in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  While de Blasio was known as a progressive who rankled many of the rank-and-file, Bratton said they shared the same vision when it came to incorporating neighborhood policing, de-escalation training, more police officers on the street and a robust budget to operate the department, Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n  As a condition of accepting the appointment, Bratton said, he made sure he could pick his team and had the freedom to make decisions without interference.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Tisch appear to be further apart philosophically than he was from de Blasio, according to Bratton.\n \n\n   \n  “The worst thing that can happen for (Mamdani) is, if (Tisch) were to step away, a successor comes in, crime goes up and disorder goes up. And the potential for that is very, very significant,” Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n   Bratton’s retirement as police commissioner in September 2016  came at a time of record declines in crime but heightened distrust of police by minority communities, after the death of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police on Staten Island in 2014, sparked protests.\n \n\n   \n    Conflicting philosophies emerge\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over as police commissioner in November of last year, just a week before prosecutors allege Luigi Mangione gunned down the UnitedHealthcare CEO in midtown Manhattan. Since then, Tisch has made her mark on the department, replacing many loyalists of former Mayor Eric Adams who were in positions of power, shuffling others around, and accepting the resignation of  former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey  after he was embroiled in an overtime-for-sexual-favors scandal.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also touted the importance of the controversial NYPD gang database used to track gang members, attacked the “Raise the Age” law, which increased the age of criminal prosecution from 16 to 18, and gone after bail reform laws – all positions that are at odds with Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  The candidate has also spoken out about disbanding the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group – an elite unit that specializes in responding to major events, whether they be protests or even the midtown mass shooting at 345 Park Ave. Mamdani also wants the final disciplinary decision on officers to go from the police commissioner to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city agency charged with oversight of the NYPD – though that would need a change to the law. Both are ideas that routinely spark sharp criticism from law enforcement circles.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the seeming differences, if Tisch were to stay, it would provide stability for officers not only out on the street, but for high-ranking officials who would otherwise be walking on eggshells inside police headquarters as they wait for a new administration to take over.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it calms a lot of the cops who may have been nervous. That there’s not going to be this big, dramatic change overnight,” said  former NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey,  who was the highest-ranked uniformed member of the department on Adams’ first day as mayor in 2022. “Whether they like (Tisch) or not, she’s the devil they know and it also helps calm the business community, who are also very worried about the prospect of what crime would look like under a Mamdani administration.”\n \n\n   \n    Mental health response would be focus\n \n\n   \n  While there may not be wholesale changes to the NYPD if Tisch stays as police commissioner, there would be new initiatives under Mamdani, such as a new civilian agency called the Department of Community Safety. The agency would focus on a community-based prevention approach targeting homelessness and people experiencing mental illness.\n \n\n   \n  Its hallmark won’t be adding more police but rather adding more mental health professionals and violence interrupters – a plan Mamdani says he hopes would free up officers to respond to other crimes.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, the NYPD responded to under 180,000 calls that involved an emotionally disturbed person, out of roughly 9 million 911 calls, according to statistics unveiled at a city hall hearing in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Corey said he tried to get a similar plan off the ground but had trouble with appropriate staffing.\n \n\n   \n  “The city is not the greatest employer when it comes to pay. You’re going to hire clinicians and social workers and people with advanced degrees. You’re not going to pay them a whole lot of money,” Corey said. “Then you’re going to tell them, ‘Oh, by the way, you know you’re working Christmas morning, or you’re working the midnight shift every weekend.’ These are the challenges we ran into when we’ve tried to do that before, even as a co-response model. There are just not enough of these clinicians and mental health professionals who are willing to go out into the street and do this kind of work in the hours that it needs to be done.”\n \n\n   \n   Richard Aborn , president of the nonprofit   Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, supports mental health professionals being involved but wonders about safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it makes a lot of sense to have mental health teams go on calls when there’s an emotionally disturbed person, but having a mental health team go exclusively could be dangerous,” Aborn said. “The question is, how are you going to assess that? A call comes into 911, there’s a person locked up in the bedroom screaming, ‘I’m going to kill you.’ Who’s going to assess whether it’s just a mental health team or if police officers go along?”\n \n\n   \n  Corey recalled a scenario when a woman called 911 asking for help for her son, telling dispatchers they were nonviolent.\n \n\n   \n  “If you heard her, she almost sounded like she was sleeping,” Corey said about the woman’s 911 call. “And she’s just ‘no, he’s not violent. He just needs to go. Somebody just needs to take him to the hospital so he can get his medicine,’ and 11 seconds after the police officers were in the apartment, there was a cop flat on his back. This guy was straddled, with a butcher knife, over him, and (NYPD) shot him.” The man was killed in the shooting, according to Corey.\n \n\n   \n    The specter of the National Guard\n \n\n   \n  Looming in the distance as well is the threat of potential federal intervention into crime-fighting in New York City, should Mamdani win the election.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has spoken out about President Donald Trump sending National Guard troops into Democrat-run major cities, a move the president says is to restore law and order. Mamdani previously told CNN he would respond to the attempt by filing a lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “What we would do in running this city, is first, to actually take this administration to court and to do so immediately as opposed to being pressured to do it,” Mamdani said, adding he would follow in the footsteps of other leaders like  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \n \n\n   \n  Bratton is among those current and former law enforcement leaders who say the sheer size and scope of the NYPD, in addition to low crime numbers, are strong indicators New York City doesn’t need the National Guard – who are already deployed but work in a different capacity  –  to patrol the streets in that way.\n \n\n   \n  It may not even come to that, Bratton said, if Tisch, a billionaire heiress from one of New York City’s most prominent families, remains at the helm.\n \n\n   \n  “Jesse and her family have very good relations with a number of the Trump side of the house,” Bratton said. “Jesse also brings a form of stability against the tide that we know is going to put pressure up against New York, and she has the ability, I think, to dissipate some of what’s going on in Los Angeles and Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over for interim police commissioner Tom Donlon, who has since gone on to  file a lawsuit alleging corruption  at the highest levels of the NYPD. She became the fourth police commissioner appointed during the Adams administration – a constant change that became emblematic of the instability and air of corruption   at the department.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the department is struggling with staffing issues as members continue to either retire or get poached by other police departments in other cities. There are currently less than 35,000 members with the NYPD, a figure that’s less than highs in 2000 and 2019, according to statistics provided by the Police Benevolent Association.\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, roughly 300 officers have left the department each month, according to the union’s statistics.   NYPD recruit classes continue to lag behind the number of recruits in previous classes, according to a union official.\n \n\n   \n  As staffing is a constant issue, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan to potentially add 5,000 new police officers to the department by 2029, a move that would boost the department’s headcount to the largest it’s been in the last 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  While the move opens the door to adding more officers, it still leaves the issue of actually finding enough recruits to fill the hiring surge. In April, city officials changed the eligibility standard for recruits, eliminating the need for college credit. The move bolstered applications, with 4,000 ineligible applicants – who did not meet the requirements – reopening their cases, according to city officials.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, who credited Tisch with rooting out corruption, believes she has shown during a turbulent period that she’s committed to the department.\n \n\n   \n  The high turnover among top police executives, is something Corey says rank and file officers – who may find themselves having to execute  progressive strategies they may not agree with – have noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “What the cops have learned at the bottom is that, ‘If I don’t like your idea, I don’t actually have to do it,’” Corey said. “‘I just need to slow walk it, because you’re going to be gone soon, and so will your idea.’”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/nancy-mace-charleston-airport-incident","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:53:00-05:00","title":"Rep.

Nancy Mace berated Charleston airport police due to missing escort, incident report says \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:53 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina allegedly berated police officers at Charleston International Airport Thursday morning, allegedly “loudly cursing” at officers and saying they were “f**king incompetent,” according to an incident report from police.\n \n\n   \n  Mace, who  closely aligns herself  with President Donald Trump and is  currently running  for South Carolina governor, has repeatedly shared concerns about her safety in the past. Last December, she reported being  “physically accosted”  on Capitol grounds.\n \n\n   \n  One officer said in their report: “Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatch (sic) and we would have addressed the behavior.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Mace’s office for comment. Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito told CNN in a statement, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito said. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”\n \n\n   \n  Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.\n \n\n   \n    Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle\n \n\n   \n  Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers. They were told she would arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, the report says.\n \n\n   \n  At 6:20 a.m., three officers went to the ticketing curb area and waited for her car, the report said. They were informed at around 6:35 a.m. she was running 15 minutes late and kept waiting for the car, they said, not seeing a white BMW.\n \n\n   \n  Security video provided to CNN by the airport shows Mace arriving at a sidewalk entrance area at 6:50 a.m. in a dark gray sedan. No other people were visible in the video. Airport officials said they had no further comment.\n \n\n   \n  A little before 7 a.m., officers were told Mace was waiting at the Transportation Security Administration known crewmember entrance, and the officers made their way over “in less than a minute,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  When officers met Mace to escort her, they said she was “very irate” and “began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department.”\n \n\n   \n  “She repeatedly stated we were ‘f**king incompetent,’ and ‘this is no way to treat a f**king US Representative’,” one officer said in his report. “She also said we would never treat (US Sen.) Tim Scott like this.”\n \n\n   \n  A different security video provided to CNN by the airport shows the TSA security checkpoint with Mace speaking with two airport officials at the known crewmember entrance. It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.\n \n\n   \n  Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior, the officer said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/obama-campaign-nj-virginia-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:21:00-05:00","title":"Obama Campaigns for Sherrill, Spanberger on Saturday in Home Stretch of Gubernatorial Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former President Barack Obama campaigned in Norfolk, Virginia, and Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday, November 1, 2025, supporting Democratic gubernatorial nominees Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill.

Spanberger on Saturday in home stretch of gubernatorial elections \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:21 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former President Barack Obama urged voters to break with President Donald Trump and “set a glorious example for the nation” on Saturday as he campaigned with the Democratic nominees for governor in Virginia and New Jersey ahead of Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In his first of two events Saturday, a rally with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger — the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race — Obama told the crowd in Norfolk that after the first nine months of Trump’s second term, “the stakes are now clear.”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said. “We all have more power than we think. We just have to use it.”\n \n\n   \n  With the Democratic Party out of power in Washington and without a clear national leader, Obama is reprising his role as the party’s biggest and most unifying draw, delivering a closing message in the final days of elections that will serve as a temperature check on Trump’s first year and set the stage for next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey later Saturday, Obama told voters the state should “point America in a better direction” by electing Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in the governor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  He mocked Ciattarelli for saying in a debate that Trump deserves an “A” grade for his performance in office.\n \n\n   \n  “I know there’s been grade inflation, but really? An A? This is the best we could do? I mean, these are the same folks who put secret war plans in a group chat,” referring to the  Signal scandal . “You don’t think there’s anything they could be doing better?”\n \n\n   \n  Before heading out to the rallies on Saturday, Obama called Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. He has not endorsed Mamdani — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the former president was sharply critical of Trump — though he only once used his name.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us are being tested right now,” Obama said. “Trump and the Republicans — they want you to think it’s part of their story, that things only happen from the top down; that a few people in power make decisions and the rest of us have to live with the consequences. But real change has always come from the bottom up; from ordinary folks who look around and say, we can do better, and then join together to make change happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Obama said he knew what Trump planned to do, but added that he “will admit, it’s worse than even I expected.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he worries about “how quickly basic democratic rules and norms have been weakened.” Obama also said he is concerned about “the growing concentration of economic power in this country,” and that business leaders, law firms and universities “have been willing to bend the knee to this president’s autocratic impulses” to avoid confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized Trump’s replacement of career prosecutors with loyalists at the Justice Department, his “shambolic tariff policy” and said the White House every day delivers “lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like every day is Halloween, except it’s all tricks and no treats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also  stepped up his warnings  about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday waited about five hours for Obama to speak, but that didn’t damper their enthusiasm. When Spanberger introduced Obama, the cheers for him were so loud you couldn’t hear her. The 7,000-seat arena was near capacity.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger sought to tie Tuesday’s election to a signal Democrats can send to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “With the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now, this election is an opportunity, because in just three more days, when the polls close, Virginia voters can and will send a message. Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” Spanberger said.\n \n\n   \n  The event served as an important base motivator on the last day of early voting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m concerned about the deterioration of the country, the way people are treated. The sadness of everything that’s happening, it’s heartbreaking,” Gail Buchanan of Chesterfield, Virginia told CNN at the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Also of note, Virginia’s Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, spoke though he was not listed as a planned speaker. Jones has been under fire for  violent language  he sent about a colleague in recently surfaced text messages in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Obama is the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have  also hit the trail  for Sherrill and Spanberger. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n  Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arlette Saenz, Eva McKend, Eric Fiegel﻿, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Dalia Abdelwahab contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/terror-attack-plot-michigan-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:04:00-04:00","title":"Alleged Terror Plot Thwarted by FBI in Michigan: What We Know and Don’t Know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI in Michigan thwarted a potential terrorist plot involving individuals who had engaged in online discussions referencing ISIS, planned high-speed reload drills with AK-47s at a shooting range, and discussed a possible attack around Halloween weekend.

day.” An online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack. A shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  A  potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend  was thwarted by the FBI, according to a social media post by agency Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  Details of the alleged plot are scarce but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about the “pumpkin day” reference, the online chat and the shooting range activity.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know and don’t know about the potential terror attack:\n \n\n   \n    Two arrests, and others being questioned\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others were being questioned, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. Their ages range from 16 to 20s.\n \n\n   \n  Patel  wrote on X  the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney who said he is representing one of the adults in custody urged people to wait for “verifiable facts” before jumping to conclusions. His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, attorney Amir Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney said he is concerned about “rhetoric that’s harmful to the large Arab and Muslim population in the state of Michigan, specifically in Dearborn” since reports of the alleged plot emerged.\n \n\n   \n  Laraib Irfan said he woke up to what he described as loud bangs from “smoke bombs” in the predawn and saw FBI agents outside his neighbor’s house two doors down on their quiet Dearborn street. He said he is “close” to the family that lives in the home and is “just trying to find answers” about what happened. Some occupants of the home were handcuffed outside.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re like family. They’re like friends. We’re always talking with each other,” he said of the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t believe that something like that would even go down on my block,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    How the alleged plot was uncovered\n \n\n   \n  The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  “This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.\n \n\n   \n  The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.\n \n\n   \n  Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”\n \n\n   \n  The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No current threat to public safety’\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no current threat to public safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.\n \n\n   \n  In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.\n \n\n   \n  She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.\n \n\n   \n  “I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00-04:00","title":"Will SNAP Benefits Be Paid in November?

Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:38 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges have said the Trump administration is required to use  emergency funds  to provide at least partial  food stamp benefits  to tens of millions of Americans in November, as the federal government shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  And President Donald Trump on Friday evening said that he’s instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the much-needed assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Also, it remains unclear whether they’ll receive their full benefits or a smaller amount since the US Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost.\n \n\n   \n  Several legal and procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The US Department of Agriculture halted November allocations, arguing it  doesn’t have the funds  to provide them, which prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s now unclear whether the administration will appeal the rulings. However, the Justice Department signaled during a hearing on Thursday that it would do so if US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued an adverse ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  A judge in Rhode Island said during proceedings Friday in a separate case over the SNAP payments that he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, the judge, John McConnell, wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If it chooses to do this, the agency must make the full payment by the end of Monday since it is simpler to make the full payment than calculate partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could also appeal this decision.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens in court, it will take time for SNAP recipients to get access to any assistance in November.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay will be felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should receive their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Still, providing full payments would be the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n    Partial payments harder to do\n \n\n   \n  However, the process could become much more complicated — and time consuming — if the USDA opts to only tap into its contingency fund and doesn’t augment it with leftover tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs, as it did with the  WIC nutrition assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency fund only has $5.3 billion remaining in it, while benefits total about $8.2 billion for the month, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which represents the USDA in the case. (Other expenses and benefits bring the total closer to $9 billion.)\n \n\n   \n  The USDA also has access to nearly $17 billion in tariff revenue, but a Justice Department attorney told a judge Friday that using the funds for SNAP would hurt the child nutrition programs that the money supports. Both Talwani and the judge in Rhode Island, John McConnell, left it up to the USDA to decide whether to use the additional resources to pay full benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  If only the contingency fund were tapped, the USDA would have to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients, which it has never done, according to a declaration filed by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies would need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in payment errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Because no template, processes, or past experience exist to inform a reduction in benefits, there are multiple variables which could lead to significant problems in attempting to reduce benefits for every SNAP household in the country,” Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in his declaration. “The ability, time and resources to accomplish this system change would vary greatly among State agencies, with some State agencies working with systems that are decades old.”\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said, drawing upon informal conversations with state agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Before states could even act, the USDA would also have to determine how to calculate and authorize the reduced allotments. This effort could be hampered if its employees have been furloughed during the shutdown or laid off or departed amid the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, Plata-Nino said.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, she noted.\n \n\n   \n  If recipients receive partial benefits in November, they would get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/trump-white-house-press-limits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:34:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration restricts reporters’ access to White House press secretary’s office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has implemented a new policy restricting reporters from accessing the White House press secretary’s office—known as the 'Upper Press'—without prior appointments, citing security concerns.

detriment of the American public,” the association said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN’s Jeff Zeleny explained, reporters routinely “wait in the hall” by the press secretary’s office and seek information from communications aides. “When there is breaking news, that often happens,” Zeleny said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, “reporters will only have access to a smaller set of offices of junior advisers, junior aides, junior press secretaries,” according to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  White House communications director Steven Cheung’s office is also deemed off-limits due to the change.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung, who regularly expresses hostility toward reporters on social media platform X, asserted in a Friday night post that, “some reporters have been caught” taking pictures of sensitive information and “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings.”\n \n\n   \n  That claim came as news to White House press corps leaders, who are not aware of colleagues being “caught.”\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bill Clinton’s presidency, Clinton aides similarly attempted to bar journalists from the “upper press” area, causing an outcry. That ban was rescinded.\n \n\n   \n  Journalists had normal access to the offices during President Trump’s first term in office. But in his second term, Trump and his aides have taken several steps to stymie news coverage and circumvent traditional media outlets.\n \n\n   \n  Last winter, the administration blocked the Associated Press   from attending some White House events, leading to a First Amendment lawsuit that is still working its way through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also stopped publishing transcripts of Trump’s remarks; has taken control of daily press pool assignments; and has invited fawning pro-Trump commentators to presidential Q&As.\n \n\n   \n  Some cabinet secretaries have followed Trump’s lead. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth implemented severe new restrictions for Pentagon press pass credentialing, leading virtually every major media outlet to reject the rules and give up access to the Pentagon complex.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/us-lawmakers-urge-andrew-to-address-epstein-links-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-05:00","title":"US Lawmakers Intensify Calls for Andrew to Address Epstein Ties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the removal of Prince Andrew Mountbatten Windsor from the royal family due to public backlash over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, US lawmakers, especially members of the House Oversight Committee, have intensified pressure on him to testify about his connections to the convicted sex offender.

special agent who previously helped oversee public corruption cases, including an investigation that became part of former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe into President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the matter — another apparent casualty of the Trump administration’s retribution push.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Tapp, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio office, was previously the deputy assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  Tapp will be retiring from the bureau later this month, a third person briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For a time he had oversight of probes into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. One of these investigations — known as Arctic Frost — focused on the fake electors scheme, in which Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot . The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls. Smith has denied any political motives and said the subpoenas were routine investigative tools.\n \n\n   \n  Tapp has been with the FBI for more than 20 years, according to his bio on the FBI’s website.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the FBI’s headquarters and San Antonio field office for comment.\n \n\n   \n   Three former senior FBI officials summarily fired  in August are suing FBI Director Kash Patel and the Trump administration, alleging that their terminations were part of a White House-directed purge driven at least in part by social media bullying from MAGA loyalists, CNN reported last month.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Driscoll, the former acting FBI director for a month at the start of the second Trump administration; Steven Jensen, who Patel installed as assistant director in charge the Washington field office; and Spencer Evans, who led the Las Vegas field office, allege that Patel has politicized the FBI to protect his own job.\n \n\n   \n  “Patel not only acted unlawfully but deliberately chose to prioritize politicizing the FBI over protecting the American people,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  The 68-page complaint provided first-hand accounts from top FBI officials of the tumultuous first few weeks of Trump’s second term. Driscoll and other senior officials resisted efforts to try to fire or otherwise punish all FBI agents or employees for simply having worked on criminal investigations of Trump, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other officials, during Senate confirmation hearings, had dismissed any plans for political retribution, despite Trump’s repeated threats during his campaign rallies to do exactly that.\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Aaron Tapp had been fired.

(See the recent controversy over  AI actress Tilly Norwood. ) But as loud as the concerns might be, AI continues to grow in the arts.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 146,000 followers on  Instagram alone , Monet is proof that consumers are increasingly open to the idea, even if the industry is riled by it.\n \n\n   \n  Monet’s Apple Music artist profile explains that Monet is “an Al figure presented as a contemporary R&B vocalist in the highly expressive, church-bred, down-to-earth vein of Keyshia Cole, K.

A seven-track EP, “Pieces Left Behind,” followed in September.\n \n\n   \n  A press release from Monet’s representative touted the AI singer’s “smooth, soulful sound” and “human-like delivery.” But Romel Murphy, who says he’s Monet’s manager and spoke with  CNN’s Victor Blackwell,  insisted that there is no intent to replace human singers and songwriters.\n \n\n   \n  “AI doesn’t replace the artist. That’s not our goal at all. It doesn’t diminish the creativity and doesn’t take away from the human experience,” he said. “It’s a new frontier and like anything would change some people are receptive and some people are apprehensive.”\n \n\n   \n  Billboard recently reported that “in just the past few months, at least six AI or AI-assisted artists have debuted on various Billboard rankings.”\n \n\n   \n  “That figure could be higher, as it’s become increasingly difficult to tell who or what is powered by AI — and to what extent,” according to the publication. “Many of these charting projects, whose music spans every genre from gospel to rock to country, also arrive with anonymous or mysterious origins.”\n \n\n   \n  Murphy doesn’t appear to see an issue and likens it all to the music of Michael Jackson and Prince, who died in 2009 and 2016 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “They both have music catalogs that are expanding decades to this day. Youth are still listening to those songs and they’re no longer with us and they’re connected to their music,” Murphy said. “So it is the music because they don’t have the history of the contact or the concert live field, but they still love those songs. Music has to evolve as well.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just have to keep the integrity and be intentional about the realness of it and push the music to the world,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Monet’s representative for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, working musicians are – as expected– troubled.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an AI R&B artist who just signed a multimillion-dollar deal … and the person is doing none of the work,” Kehlani  said  of Monet in a now-deleted video posted to TikTok. “This is so beyond out of our control.”\n \n\n   \n  The human singer added: “Nothing and no one on Earth will ever be able to justify AI to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/europe/ukraine-pokrovsk-russia-fighting-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:12:00-04:00","title":"Fighting intensifies around key town in Ukraine amid fresh attacks on Russian energy","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Fighting around the strategic Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk is intensifying, with Russian forces advancing and attempting to cut off supply lines, while Ukrainian special forces conduct counter-operations and report battlefield successes.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:12 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fighting for control of the strategic hub of Pokrovsk in eastern  Ukraine  is intensifying, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have eliminated a group of Ukrainian special forces sent to help defend the area.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,  Russian  units have begun penetrating Pokrovsk itself and have closed in on the last resupply routes used to sustain Ukrainian forces in the town.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian special forces had landed in a helicopter on the northwestern outskirts of Pokrovsk, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.\n \n\n   \n  A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military’s commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that Pokrovsk and the neighboring town of Myrnohrad were “not surrounded or blocked, and we are doing everything we can to maintain logistics.”\n \n\n   \n  “A comprehensive operation to destroy and dislodge enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had visited the area to coordinate its defense.\n \n\n   \n  Enemy units continued “to attempt to infiltrate residential areas and cut off our supply routes,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad was tightening.\n \n\n   \n  President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.\n \n\n   \n  Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n  According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.\n \n\n   \n  Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.\n \n\n   \n  Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n    Pipelines blown up\n \n\n   \n  As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  “The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).\n \n\n   \n  It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting. Video published by DI showed an explosion that sent flames hundreds of meters into the air.\n \n\n   \n  “All three lines used by the aggressor to transport gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel were successfully and simultaneously blown up,” DI said.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many recent attacks using drones and missiles, the Ukrainians used a sabotage team to lay explosive devices at the site, according to the DI video.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no word from the Russian authorities on the explosion nor on any disruption to fuel supplies. But the local authorities in the nearby district of Zhukovsky reported power cuts for some consumers on Friday without specifying the cause.\n \n\n   \n  The pipeline that forms a ring around Moscow is fed from several refineries. It is capable of pumping up to 3 million tons of aviation fuel, up to 2.8 million tons of diesel fuel, and up to 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, according to DI.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine began  targeting  Russian energy infrastructure on a persistent basis in the summer, using longer-range drones and missiles to attack facilities deep inside Russian territory.\n \n\n   \n  “Our strikes have had more impact than the sanctions [against Russia]” said Budanov. “We have caused much greater damage to the Russian Federation through direct action than any economic levers of influence that have been introduced so far.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Zelensky said earlier this month that as much as  20%  of Russian refining capacity had been taken out of action, and several Russian regions have reported petrol shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has imported more fuel from Belarus to compensate for the shortages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/berkshire-hathaway-profits-buffett","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-04:00","title":"Berkshire Profit Rises, Cash Soars to Record","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Berkshire Hathaway reported strong financial results in the third quarter of 2025, with a 34% rise in operating profit and a 17% increase in net income due to gains on stock investments.

\nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In our travel news round-up this week: advice for holiday travelers, a robot that could save old languages from dying out, plus a new super-luxurious overnight train in Italy.\n \n\n   \n    Holiday travel preview\n \n\n   \n  Have you thought about holiday travel yet? Time is just about up if you want the best deals on flights for Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to travel company Kayak, which uses search data to analyze trends. The booking “sweet spot for holiday savings” stretches from mid-October to early November, the company says.\n \n\n   \n  Holiday travel set a record in the US last year, and it’s forecast to surpass 2024 levels. Aviation analytics firm Cirium told CNN that passenger bookings on major US airlines for Thanksgiving are up 2.2 percent from last year.\n \n\n   \n  Reservations for Christmas week are up as well, but less than 1 percent, Cirium said.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to avoid the crowds?  Kayak suggests  flying out for Thanksgiving on Monday, November 24. That day will be the cheapest. As for Christmas, the most affordable day to fly domestically or internationally will be Christmas Eve.\n \n\n   \n  A rush of passengers would be welcome news to America’s travel industry, which the U.S. Travel Association estimates has lost out on $1 billion in consumer spending every week of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controller staffing shortages have already caused delays at facilities across the country during the monthlong shutdown, and it could get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy  warned on Thursday , after a roundtable at the White House with aviation, travel and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  At LaGuardia Airport in New York earlier this week, Duffy said safety would never be compromised, but staffing shortages often result in slower rates of departures and arrivals.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have issues, we will slow it down,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  AAA recommends travelers arrive at the airport extra early in case of TSA security line delays caused by potential staffing shortages.\n \n\n   \n    Still time to get spooked\n \n\n   \n  Halloween weekend’s not over yet, and some “spooky explorers” hunt for ghosts all year long. Here’s why paranormal tourists  spend big money on terrifying trips . And ghosts aren’t the only attractions around the globe that are  macabre and mysterious .\n \n\n   \n    Italy’s ‘dolce vita’ just got sweeter\n \n\n   \n  A luxurious new train service in Italy is giving travelers a taste of the good life while spiriting them through the stunning countryside, with glimpses of Tuscany’s famed hill towns.  CNN spent 24 hours on board .\n \n\n   \n  The aptly named Dolce Vita Orient Express, which was unveiled earlier this year, is Italy’s first homegrown luxury train. It’s meant to evoke the panache of post-war Italy as exemplified by the films of Federico Fellini, including,  chiaramente , the 1960 classic, “La Dolce Vita.”\n \n\n   \n  Travelers can choose among 18 itineraries.

By Richard Quest, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it clear that his favorite method to gain leverage over opponent countries on the other side of a negotiating table is to  raise tariffs . It doesn’t matter whether the offense is trade-related or not.\n \n\n   \n  If there had been any lingering doubt (and I doubt there was), it was erased when Trump announced last week that he was  increasing tariffs  on Canada by 10% because he didn’t like an  anti-tariff commercial  Ontario aired across the United States. Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s TV ad quoted the late former President Ronald Reagan, who in 1987 criticized the use of general tariffs as a weapon of trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  It might seem obvious that there is no direct causal trade link between Ontario’s and, by extension Canada’s, action and Trump’s threat of raising Canada’s tariffs by 10%. Nevertheless, Trump’s response was hardly a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  The Canadian incident shows countries on the other side of the negotiating table with the United States face a near-impossible situation.\n \n\n   \n  First, they must negotiate trade deals by coming to Washington with a transactional mindset: “What can we offer up?”\n \n\n   \n  Second, they must, at the last minute, be prepared for the US president to want more — so they better have something else up their sleeve they can give as an offering.\n \n\n   \n  And there’s a third wrinkle: Never mind reciprocal tariffs — the United States is in the business of retaliatory tariffs for seemingly unrelated issues. It means no country can know what decision, policy or indiscretion will offend Trump, who may retaliate at virtually any time with further tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  This is uncharted territory, and it is not the normal way of doing business. Traditionally, tariffs have been used to correct a perceived trade imbalance and to protect the home market by making imports more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  What seems clear is that Trump’s love of tariffs will ensure they remain at the heart of US economic policy. I see no scenario in which the president, even after having negotiated a trade deal, doesn’t reserve to himself the right unilaterally to change his mind, threaten and then launch a fresh tariff.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Trump’s tariffs contain at least a scintilla of geo-political logic. For example, his decision to punish India with 50% tariffs came because the country is still buying oil from Russia. One could – just about – argue the tariff was supporting some wider, strategic goal in halting the Russia-Ukraine war.\n \n\n   \n  With others, it remains difficult or impossible to understand the trade purpose of tariffs. Take Brazil’s case: Trump thinks it’s wrong to prosecute the former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for allegedly plotting to overturn an election. Describing the prosecution as “a witch hunt that should end immediately,” Trump raised the tariff to 50% due “in part to Brazil’s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans.” (The previous tariff had been around 10%.)\n \n\n   \n  According to the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association, exports of special coffees are now down 70% and the IMF is warning of a more general slowdown in Brazil’s economy because of the tariffs.  The tariff weapon has hit its mark.\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s Colombia. After Colombian President Gustavo Petro criticized Trump’s bombings of alleged drug smugglers off the Caribbean coast, Trump called Petro “an illegal drug leader” who is “low rated” and very unpopular. The punishment: cutting off foreign aid and an unspecified increase in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  For a country where democracy is often fragile at best, the economic disruption from increased tariffs could have devastating political effects.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also imposed steep tariffs on South Africa for its perceived ill treatment of White farmers and land reforms.\n \n\n   \n  The list goes on. Last week’s threat against Canada only confirmed the trend.\n \n\n   \n  After the last few weeks and months, countries have been warned. No one should be surprised if and when the weapon is fired.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the only country that has stood up to Trump and won is China. Xi Jinping has mastered the careful art of letting Trump appear to win while quietly claiming victory at home.  Xi played his hand perfectly  and came away from their meeting this past week with a reduction in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s one final wrinkle: The US Supreme Court next week will hear Trump’s appeal of two lower court rulings that found his use of tariffs as leverage to be an illegal use of his emergency powers. If the Supreme Court upholds those rulings, Trump’s favorite tool could be significantly blunted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/michigan-church-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-04:00","title":"FBI Says Shooter in Deadly Michigan Church Attack Was Motivated by Hatred Toward Mormon Faith","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI confirmed that Thomas Jacob Sanford, a former Marine who opened fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, on September 28, 2025, was motivated by anti-religious beliefs specifically targeting the Mormon faith.

shooter in deadly Michigan church attack was motivated by hatred toward the Mormon faith \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:49 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The former Marine who  opened fire in a Michigan church  and set it ablaze in September was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the FBI confirmed Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While  friends of the gunman  in the deadly shooting have said he harbored hatred for what is widely known as the Mormon church, the FBI had previously declined to specify the motivation behind the attack that left four people dead and the church burned to the ground, except to say it was a “targeted” act of violence.\n \n\n   \n  The gunman,  Thomas Jacob Sanford , 40, was killed by  law enforcement  responding to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confirming this is a targeted act of violence believed to be motivated by the assailant’s anti-religious beliefs against the Mormon religious community,” Jennifer Runyan, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit field office, said in a prerecorded video message. The agency declined to share further information on what led to its conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Sanford drove his pickup truck into the side of a Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, 60 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, on Sunday, Sept. 28, and began shooting at congregants. Authorities have said he used gasoline as an accelerant to then light the church on fire.\n \n\n   \n   Body camera footage  released by Grand Blanc Township police shows an officer yelling, “Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it now!” One of the officers tells another, “I’ve got your back, back here man. Yeah stay there. Shoot him!”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI said Friday that nine people were injured in the attack. The previous official count had been eight.\n \n\n   \n  “During our investigation, an additional individual was determined to be “injured” during the Grand Blanc critical incident,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The agency declined to comment Friday on the nature of the additional injury.\n \n\n   \n  The four people who were killed have been identified through family and friends as Craig Hayden, William “Pat” Howard, John Bond and Thelma Armstrong.\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Louis, who was in the chapel when her father, Hayden, was fatally shot, wrote in a letter that after looking into the shooter’s eyes, she  forgave him , “with my heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, top church leaders preached a  message of love and forgiveness  in the wake of the attack while gathered for the faith’s twice-annual general conference in its home state of Utah. Its members responded by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in an  online fundraiser for the gunman’s family .\n \n\n   \n  The church said it strengthened its security protocols for the conference and, days later, for the  funeral of its oldest-ever president , who died a day before the Michigan shooting.\n \n\n   \n  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not have a comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Brandt Malone, a member of the faith who was attending services at a nearby church on the morning of the shooting, said the FBI’s statement “did confirm some of our darkest fears — that this attack was motivated by hatred.”\n \n\n   \n  “This affects all believers of all religious traditions, and it hurts that there are those out there who are motivated by the darkest of feelings,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Malone grew up attending events at the church where the attack occurred. He said local Latter-day Saints have been uplifted by an outpouring of love from the Grand Blanc Township community and other religious congregations.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have released little information about Sanford and the attack. People who knew him have said he began vocalizing anti-Mormon sentiments years ago after living in Utah, where he dated and broke up with a girlfriend who was a member of the faith. Sanford had moved to Utah after leaving the Marines and told his friends he had become addicted to methamphetamines.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney acting as a spokesperson for Sanford’s family did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/early-voting-elections-nyc-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early voting data from New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City indicates that Democratic candidates are in stronger positions than Kamala Harris was at the same point in 2024.

heading into the final weekend in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may be in a stronger position than in the primary, but there are signs of increased activity from younger voters, a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base .\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints

voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic   primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%. The worst performing counties so far have been places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they’re at just 54% of the in-person votes they’d cast at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n  And that gap between Trump- and Harris-won counties has been narrowing over the course of the last week, dropping from 10 points to 4 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as  Arlington  and  Fairfax .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/science/nasa-moon-lunar-lander-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-04:00","title":"Inside NASA’s scramble to find a backup moon plan — and the wild ideas companies are pitching","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA is under pressure to accelerate its Artemis III moon landing mission, which is currently scheduled for mid-2027, due to delays in SpaceX’s Starship development and China’s lunar ambitions.

However, citing delays in Starship’s development and competitive pressure from China, NASA asked SpaceX and Blue Origin — which holds a separate lunar lander contract with the space agency — to submit plans to expedite development of their respective spacecraft by October 29.  Both companies have responded.\n \n\n   \n  But the space agency is also asking the broader commercial space industry to detail how they might get the job done more quickly, hinting that NASA leadership is prepared to sideline its current partners.\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke with half a dozen companies about how they plan to respond to NASA’s call to action, which the agency will formally issue once the government shutdown ends, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  While some of the potential proposals appear more straightforward than the current moon-landing plan that uses Starship, each involves constructing and testing new spacecraft designs, a process that typically takes at least six or seven years, noted Casey Drier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society.\n \n\n   \n  This could pose an issue for NASA’s timeline. China aims to land its astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and Duffy has repeatedly indicated he views beating China as a national security imperative.\n \n\n   \n  Artemis III is currently slated to happen as early as mid-2027, and NASA has signaled that the current pace of Starship development is threatening to push that target months or years into the future.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,” Duffy said, referring to the moon’s largely unexplored south pole region — the target landing site for NASA’s Artemis III astronauts.\n \n\n   \n  “We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America,” he said in  August .\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN for this article said that reevaluating SpaceX’s lunar lander contract could be wise. Spending years to develop an entirely new spacecraft could still potentially be faster, some argued, than waiting for Starship, which presents extremely difficult engineering challenges due to its sheer size and unprecedented design.\n \n\n   \n  Still, SpaceX has ticked a few boxes that might give it a significant leg up on the competition. Though in light of NASA’s broader lunar ambitions, experts say the real contest is about much more than speed.\n \n\n   \n    More power, more problems\n \n\n   \n  Touted as the most powerful rocket system ever built, Starship has launched on 11 eye-popping suborbital test flights, relighting engines in space, reusing boosters and demonstrating the ability to deploy satellites along the way.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted to its website on Thursday, SpaceX also said it has “completed 49 milestones tied to developing the subsystems, infrastructure, and operations needed to land astronauts on the Moon.” And the “vast majority” of its contractual testing milestones for NASA have happened on schedule, according to the company.\n \n\n   \n  NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on SpaceX’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Starship has also faced significant setbacks — particularly this year. In the first six months of 2025, three prototype vehicles exploded during test flights and another burst into flames during routine ground testing, causing damage to SpaceX’s surrounding infrastructure in Texas. The hangups prompted national security hawks to voice worries that SpaceX won’t deliver Starship in time to realize NASA’s goals.\n \n\n   \n  Under the current plan, NASA would launch its astronauts aboard the Orion capsule atop the Space Launch System rocket, both of which NASA developed. After reaching lunar orbit, the astronauts would transfer to Starship, which would ferry two people down to the moon’s surface and then back to lunar orbit.\n \n\n   \n  But Starship is likely still a long way from being capable of carrying out such an endeavor.  So far, the company has only attempted to fly Starship on hour-long, suborbital test flights. It has not yet sent a vehicle to orbit on an operational mission, nor has it attempted to top off Starship’s fuel during a flight — a step that will be necessary for lunar missions because of Starship’s massive size and design.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how many refueling flights would need to be launched prior to Starship carrying out Artemis III. As CNN previously reported, the number could be  anywhere from 10 to 40 . And transferring cryogenic propellants, of the kind Starship relies on, has never been attempted before with any spacecraft.\n \n\n   \n  “SpaceX is not going to be able to make this work before 2030,” said Doug Loverro, a former chief of human spaceflight at NASA, expressing a sentiment recently  echoed  by two prior NASA administrators.\n \n\n   \n  The company did not provide details about its plan to expedite work on the NASA contract. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment from CNN, nor does the company typically answer questions from reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Retrofitting Blue Moon\n \n\n   \n  One alternative option that Duffy mentioned during a TV blitz last week is using a spacecraft built by Blue Origin. The Jeff Bezos-funded company already has a contract to provide lunar landers for use later in the Artemis program, including the Artemis V mission.\n \n\n   \n  And because Blue Origin already has an Artemis contract, it could be simpler for NASA to switch up the order in which it relies on its contractors rather than bringing a new company into the mix.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, Blue Origin is developing two models of its Blue Moon landers: Mark 1 for cargo, and Mark 2, the vehicle designed for humans and intended for use during Artemis V.\n \n\n   \n  But to expedite the creation of a lunar lander that could be used for the Artemis III mission, Blue Origin plans to propose a new design that leverages elements of both Mark 1 and Mark 2, according to an industry source familiar with the plan that hasn’t been made public.\n \n\n   \n  Then, to get the vehicle to the moon, Blue Origin would make use of one or more Mark 1 landers that have been essentially converted into small rocket stages that could boost a scaled-down version of Mark 2 out of Earth orbit and to its destination.\n \n\n   \n  The approach would require multiple launches, but likely fewer than the current plan with Starship, the source noted. Blue Origin’s plan also does not require the launch of refueling tankers or transferring super-chilled propellants between spacecraft in orbit.\n \n\n   \n    A team effort\n \n\n   \n  Lockheed Martin — which previously worked on Blue Origin’s lander design but is not actively part of a partnership — also intends to throw its hat in the ring.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, as a legacy NASA contractor, the company built the  $20.4 billion Orion spacecraft  that astronauts will ride when they take off from Earth.   Orion has already flown one successful mission around the moon — Artemis I — and is slated for a crewed test flight to lunar orbit as soon as February.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Lockheed says it can piece together a two-stage lunar lander that uses spare parts harvested from Orion.\n \n\n   \n  The company would make use of Space Shuttle-era OMS-E engines — which are also  used on Orion  — to serve as the propulsion for an “ascent stage” of the lunar lander, providing the thrust for the vehicle to lift off the moon after a mission is completed.\n \n\n   \n  But the vehicle also needs a descent stage to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  For that component, Lockheed plans to work with another commercial space outfit, though it has not yet decided which one, said Rob Chambers, Lockheed’s director of human spaceflight strategy, and Tim Cichan, the company’s chief architect of space exploration, during a video call last week.\n \n\n   \n  There are two paths Lockheed could take   for its descent stage that could determine which company it teams up with.   It could use a cryogenically fueled lunar lander similar to Blue Origin’s Mark 1. Or it could go with a vehicle that uses more stable propellants such as hypergolic fuels.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed decides to go with cryogenic fuels, which must be kept at super-cold temperatures, it would need to launch its ascent stage and descent stage on separate rockets and dock them in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  In that scenario, it may also need to launch additional “boost stages” to kick them out to the moon, Cichan said.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed opts for a descent stage with more stable fuels, however, the whole lander could launch in one piece. But it would need to be topped off with fuel in orbit, Cichan added.\n \n\n   \n  He noted  that the refueling process in that case would not, however, be as complex as attempting to refuel cryogenically powered spacecraft, such as Blue Origin’s lander or SpaceX’s Starship, in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Transferring stable fuels between vehicles in orbit is a less risky proposition and has been taking place on the International Space Station since 2000, Cichan explained. “The Russians and Soviets have been doing it all the way back to the ‘70s,” Cichan said. “So that’s very known technology.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what would make Lockheed’s proposal competitive with Blue Origin or SpaceX, Chamers said the company’s “approach is quickest because it leverages existing hardware, minimizes the required cadence of launches, and does not rely on technologies like cryogenic refueling or long duration storage that have never been performed on orbit.”\n \n\n   \n  Other commercial space companies contacted by CNN — including Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman — said simply that they were “ready to support” NASA in its endeavor to find a faster way to complete the Artemis III mission.\n \n\n   \n  They did not confirm whether they would formally respond to the space agency’s anticipated request for   companies to submit proposals.\n \n\n   \n    Back to the drawing board\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN suggested that NASA should stretch its imagination when it comes to the spacecraft that will land astronauts on the moon.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody’s put together a true concept of design,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that’s doable very quickly,” he noted, adding that he believes a new lander could go from concept to reality within five years.\n \n\n   \n  Loverro suggested that NASA should leverage in-house expertise by leaning on its own Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, which he said should be empowered to rapidly pursue a lunar lander development program.\n \n\n   \n  While JPL couldn’t do the job alone, because the center is focused on robotic exploration and does not have human spaceflight experience, Loverro noted, the laboratory   has built a reputation over decades for its engineering precision and ability to pull off complex missions on unforgiving timelines.\n \n\n   \n  “You really want that that kind of program management leadership that JPL embodies so well,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n    Expensive red herrings\n \n\n   \n  One huge consideration with any of these proposals is the price.\n \n\n   \n  From NASA’s vantage point, SpaceX’s Starship is by far the cheapest proposal because the company is spending so much of its own money on the project. The company even  estimates  it is funding 90% of Starship’s production, test and launch facilities.\n \n\n   \n  None of the other companies CNN spoke with about alternative proposals for NASA’s lunar lander offered cost estimates for bringing their ideas to fruition.\n \n\n   \n  But as with any spaceflight project, it’s safe to assume they won’t be cheap.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s funds are already limited. While Congress has been on board with supporting the Artemis program — adding $10 billion to bolster lunar efforts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — it’s not clear whether lawmakers would throw even more money at the project in an attempt to speed things up.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency also can’t easily cancel existing contracts with either SpaceX or Blue Origin.\n \n\n   \n  Drier noted, however, that support for the Artemis program does seem to be a stand-out unifying force for lawmakers. He also highlighted the fact that the current administration clearly views Artemis as a priority, allowing work on the program to continue  despite the ongoing government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  But considering the time and money space programs tend to consume, an attempt to hash out a new moon landing plan for Artemis III is an idea that “is probably three years too late to make a difference,” Drier added.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only ever been one example of a successful human lunar lander in history: The contract for that was awarded in 1962, and it was first demonstrated on Apollo 9 in 1968,” Drier noted.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s six years — and that cost about 30-ish billion dollars” for the lunar lander alone when adjusted for inflation, which is an exorbitant amount of money that exceeds the agency’s entire annual budget since the mid-1990s, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency’s funding levels have remained far below the highs hit during the Apollo era in the decades since the program concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Another key consideration is time: It’s possible that pursuing one of these alternative options does successfully expedite the Artemis III mission. It’s also possible this pursuit will be an expensive red herring — sucking time and resources away from realizing the plan NASA has been working toward for years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A base not a race’\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the flurry of conversations around rushing to cobble together a lunar lander, another discussion has been percolating — one that questions whether NASA should be trying to expedite Artemis III at all.\n \n\n   \n  Drier is among the experts who told CNN that they did not view simply landing on the moon before China as essential. The more important goal, they argue, is to pave the way for a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX has appeared to support this viewpoint,  saying in its Thursday statement that Starship “will be a central enabler that will fulfill the vision of NASA’s Artemis program, which seeks to establish a lasting presence on the lunar surface, not just flags and footprints, and ultimately forge the path to land the first humans on Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  The company argues that is why Starship remains the best option for NASA’s Artemis program: The vehicle boasts a massive cargo bay and immense power that could be transformational — opening up possibilities once considered unthinkable, such as delivering 100 metric tons of cargo to the moon in one trip, according to SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  In the public imagination, the new “space race” — as much as it really is a race — may be won or lost the moment the next astronaut sets foot on the moon. But perhaps the true winner will be the country that is able to build lasting infrastructure, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes great press fodder to frame this as competition,” said one space policy source, who was among several that spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss controversial issues. “But this is about the long game and the sustainability.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/africa/tanzania-hassan-landslide-election-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Tanzania’s Hassan declared landslide winner in election marred by violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Tanzania’s 2025 presidential election, President Samia Suluhu Hassan was declared the winner by the electoral commission with 97.66% of the vote, despite widespread protests over allegations of electoral manipulation and repression.

6:31 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, adopted a joint declaration on trade and investment at a major summit in South Korea Saturday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight by calling for unity, cooperation and proposing a global body to govern artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs have loomed over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth. The leaders also adopted an AI initiative and a framework to respond to demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum in his opening remarks Friday. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su﻿ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  “I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.\n \n\n   \n  “I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the  warm camaraderie  showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.\n \n\n   \n  For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and  diplomatic rows . Trade negotiations with the US, Canada’s biggest trading partner, are at  a dead end , and Carney said at the APEC summit that he was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders “affirmed their commitment to renewing the relationship between their two countries in a pragmatic and constructive way” and discussed a framework “to deepen cooperation across a range of areas – from clean and conventional energy, to agriculture, manufacturing, climate change, and international finance,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Carney also accepted an invitation to visit China and both leaders “directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Carney said that he had apologized to Trump for a  political advertisement  that angered the President so much that he terminated trade talks with Canada.\n \n\n   \n  “I did apologize to the President,” Carney said when asked by a reporter about the issue on Saturday. “The President was offended by the ad. It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”\n \n\n   \n  The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/shutdown-congress-divided","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The problem is everybody wants to win: Congress bitterly deadlocked as shutdown pain skyrockets","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown is nearing its longest duration in history, with lawmakers deadlocked over funding and no resolution in sight.

President Donald Trump said later Friday he’d instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be  a partial and short-term fix . Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.\n \n\n   \n  And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you’ve got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”\n \n\n   \n  “I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources.\n \n\n   \n  And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen. Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “I also think Democrats are going to get a flood of calls from people saying, wait, wait a minute. My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats’ biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they’re not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.\n \n\n   \n  “People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?’ Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it’s a little unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  Many House lawmakers concede they don’t know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also pointed to Trump’s late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won’t do what’s best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  That includes Trump’s resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders’ offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I’m not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won’t be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We’ll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration’s recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out. One senior congressional GOP aide stressed that it was never a real option.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the behind-the-scenes activity offers a window into the increasing urgency to end the shutdown before more pain hits Americans across the country — and the lingering concern within the administration over which side will bear the brunt of the political fallout.\n \n\n   \n  In recent polling, more voters still blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown than they do Democrats. And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it’s also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”\n \n\n   \n  Within Trump’s orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won’t last much beyond Tuesday’s elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, insist it’s Trump who needs to offer them one.\n \n\n   \n  “We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president. He spent an hour on this, as far as I could tell, in a month. An hour. How much time has he spent on his ballroom?” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters this week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-04:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, with Jamaica suffering the worst damage due to a Category 5 landfall.

\nUpdated: \n        7:19 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 50 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday  statement .\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power,  Jamaican government officials  said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated.\n \n\n   \n  As many as 140,000 people were cut off due to rising rivers as the storm passed, according to  the Red Cross . In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 30 deaths, Reuters said. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the UK pledged an additional an additional 5 million pounds ($6.5 million).\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/gaza-israel-isf-trump-plan-ceasefire-cnn","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"New Administration Launches Healthcare Initiative Amid Rising Political Polarization","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the political transition following a closely contested national election, focusing on the new administration led by President Elena Marquez.

Maruf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More likely than not, someone in your community — whether  friend, family or neighbor  — uses   SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  As  millions of people could lose access to food assistance programs  during the government shutdown, many Americans are trying — in however small a way — to fill in the gaps for people at risk of being left behind.\n \n\n   \n   Two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration has to tap into emergency funds  to at least partially cover November food assistance. But the aid, which was scheduled to disperse on the first of the month, will still be delayed reaching recipients.\n \n\n   \n  Tee Tran, the owner of Vietnamese restaurant Monster Pho in Oakland, California, knows the struggle all too well. He was one of the thousands of Vietnamese boat people, eventually reaching California in 1989, where his mother worked five jobs and used SNAP benefits to keep food on the table. Now he’s decided to give away free meals to children receiving help through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and a discount for their parents.\n \n\n   \n  “When I see these kids going through this and not having food, it really makes me think of me,” Tran said. “I know how it’s like when you look up to your parents and they want to give you so much … but financially they can’t do it.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though people are pitching in as much as they can to help, there are few options for families that help as much as food stamps. \n \n\n   \n  “No food bank, no charitable organization, can fill the gap if November SNAP isn’t provided,” Stefanie Shuman, Food Bank For New York City’s communications director, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Check with local businesses\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Cassidy, the owner of a chain restaurant on Long Island called KC’s Pizza & Wings, made a heartfelt post on social media saying he would provide a free meal, no questions asked, to anyone presenting a SNAP/EBT card. He didn’t expect the flood of support.\n \n\n   \n  In two days, he said he got over $1,000 in donations and hundreds of messages from people around the country asking how they can help. Now, he’s planning on prepping pre-made meals, working with a local food bank and using community donations to give out gift cards to local grocers.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is struggling a bit, and when you help others it comes back tenfold. The only way to receive is to give,” Cassidy said.\n \n\n   \n  Tran, the owner of Monster Pho, said he has lost 30% of his business in the past six months because of tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced spending from his customers. That’s why he’s offering free meals to children and a discount to their parents, to help as much as he can without going under.\n \n\n   \n    Donate to a food bank\n \n\n   \n  Food Banks say that cash donations are more helpful than giving food directly if people are able to do so, because they are able to buy a lot more food in bulk themselves. In New York City, for example, $1 can provide up to 5 meals at Food Bank For NYC.\n \n\n   \n  Many companies also match employee donations to organizations such as these, so check with your employer, as well.\n \n\n   \n  The money goes a long way, especially right now.  Food banks have already been feeling the strain  due to increased lines and higher prices of food.\n \n\n   \n    Grocery Buddies\n \n\n   \n  Other people are using online forums to act as “grocery buddies” for families at risk of losing benefits,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors post in these community groups that they are willing to be a “grocery buddy,” offering help to whoever needs. Then, the parties figure what that help will look like, whether that means shopping together, using gift cards or something else.\n \n\n   \n    Local food pantry and mutual aid groups\n \n\n   \n  For those donating physical food, food bank groups said the best options are non-perishables. Key items include proteins such as canned chicken, tuna and salmon, as well as beans and nut butters. Pastas and rice also have a long shelf life.\n \n\n   \n  Other items food banks and local groups tend to need are hygiene products, such as tampons, pads, diapers and wipes, which can eat away at peoples’ grocery budgets.\n \n\n   \n    Call your local representative\n \n\n   \n  Other advocates say an easy and free way to take action is to call your local representative as the government is still shut down.\n \n\n   \n  Some local and state governments have stepped up to attempt to fill the gap left by SNAP, though it’s still not enough to totally cover the amount of aid.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no face to hunger. It’s oftentimes, again, working families… (when) the wage has not kept pace with the cost of living,” Shuman said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/judge-blocks-trump-citizenship-proof-voting-form","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge rules Trump can’t require citizenship proof on federal voting form","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that President Donald Trump lacks constitutional authority to require documentary proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms, declaring the executive order an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.

\nUpdated: \n        10:57 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections.\n \n\n   \n  She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.\n \n\n   \n  She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.”\n \n\n   \n  Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when  she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. \n \n\n   \n  The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.”\n \n\n   \n  A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.\n \n\n   \n  While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire.\n \n\n   \n  In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote.\n \n\n   \n  Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/portland-national-guard-deployment-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00.000Z","title":"Federal Judge to Rule on National Guard Deployment in Portland After Legal Battle Reveals Violations and Sovereignty Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal trial in Portland over the deployment of National Guard troops to protect an ICE facility revealed a critical conflict between federal executive power and state sovereignty.

National Guard in Portland. Here’s what the trial revealed \n       \n  By Jason Kravarik, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A trial to decide the  fate of the National Guard deployments  in Oregon concluded Friday, leaving Portland residents, Trump administration officials and hundreds of soldiers in limbo as they await the judge’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut presided over the three-day trial that featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier this month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what top federal and National Guard officials knew — and didn’t know — when President Donald Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility that has faced months of protests.\n \n\n   \n  As Oregon and California challenge the effort to send 400 soldiers from their states to the facility, federal attorneys argued during the trial it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  “The government cannot create the very emergency they propose to resolve,” Oregon attorney Scott Kennedy said.\n \n\n   \n  Troops have so far been barred from deploying due to two temporary restraining orders from Immergut: one blocking  troops from Oregon  and another blocking  troops from any state . The former order is temporarily on hold after  being appealed  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Plaintiffs are seeking a ban on deploying National Guard troops to Oregon. The judge, whom  Trump appointed  during his first term, is expected to file a decision by Sunday when the previous order expires. The decision is expected to draw a quick appeal from the losing side.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ admits soldiers were at ICE facility even after judge’s order\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced abruptly in a social media post last month that he would order Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, hurling his administration into a legal showdown with the state.\n \n\n   \n  As the case played out, Immergut issued an initial restraining order on October 4 blocking the deployment. But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  The judge briefly pressed the Trump administration on whether the soldiers’ presence might have been in contempt of her order, questioning why the government would deploy those Guard members while knowing her ruling on the restraining order was imminent.\n \n\n   \n  “The government deployed that very night that I told you I would issue an opinion,” Immergut said. “Does that not seem in bad faith?”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think so,” Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton replied, adding that the Guard members were needed at the ICE building prior to the judge’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn’t vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that seem odd?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.”\n \n\n   \n  “My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was tabled after Immergut suggested there could be a separate hearing on the potential order violation.\n \n\n   \n    ICE facility official was surprised by Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified.\n \n\n   \n  A deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said he and his boss, the FPS regional director, found out about the order on the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised,” R.C. said.\n \n\n   \n  “Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men?’” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, sir,” R.C. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility. Asked about  Trump’s claim  that Portland is “burning down,” the official said, “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down.”\n \n\n   \n  A high-ranking official in the National Guard Bureau also testified that he had never been to Portland’s ICE facility – or been formally briefed on the conditions there – before he authorized the Guard deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Acting Major General Timothy Rieger said the only direct information he had regarding conditions on the ground in Portland were from the media and other anecdotal accounts.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know if that (media) footage is from this year or prior years?” asked California attorney Barbara Horne-Petersdorf.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not know the veracity of that footage,” Rieger replied.\n \n\n   \n  Rieger said he was acting on the direction of an internal memo from the Secretary of Defense’s office that was corroborated by a Truth Social post from Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Is the facility ‘under siege’ or under control?\n \n\n   \n  Underpinning the arguments was a fundamental disagreement over how extreme the demonstrations have been – and whether local law enforcement is capable of handling criminal activity or violence when it occurs.\n \n\n   \n  Portland “is not war-ravaged, there is no rebellion, and the laws continue to be enforced every day,” Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said during opening statements.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, state and city attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting there have been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, Oregon’s attorney Scott Kennedy called them “precisely the kinds of challenges” that existing law enforcement can and have handled.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration focused on a particularly chaotic night in June as they argued local law enforcement is unable to fully protect the facility.\n \n\n   \n  The tense June 14 protest resulted in a  riot declaration by Portland police , and drew a crowd that was “very active, high-energy and engaged in active criminal conduct,” said DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis, quoting a report from Oregon State Police Captain Cameron Bailey.\n \n\n   \n  During cross examination on Wednesday, Bailey admitted troopers—who were scheduled to provide mutual aid to Portland police—were not on scene before the protest began.\n \n\n   \n  There was “no immediate law enforcement intervention available at that time?” Davis asked. Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. There was also an attempt to “breach the facility,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C.\n \n\n   \n  “Protesters were putting chains on the door,” R.C. said. “It shows an attempt to lock the officers in and create a hazard for the team that was there.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object.\n \n\n   \n  Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for Oregon and Portland maintain Trump’s lawyers are seizing on a small sample size of dates that ended in violence, instead of a vast majority of nights that remained peaceful.\n \n\n   \n  Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city’s sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not engage in immigration-related enforcement or participate in activities” that could be related to it, Schoening said. That includes clearing crowds in front of the ICE driveway, so the task was left to federal agents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland’s participation with agencies using such munitions.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unpredictable’ use of force can create safety risks, police commander says\n \n\n   \n  The Portland police commander highlighted starkly different approaches between federal and local law enforcement in handling the protests, saying federal tactics sometimes contribute to the chaos.\n \n\n   \n  Portland police often have different interpretations of the level of threat outside the ICE facility, Schoening said, including on October 18, when federal agents used munitions on the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “We simply didn’t see that (as necessary),” Schoening said.\n \n\n   \n  That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. “Our officers were impacted by those munitions.”\n \n\n   \n  The commander said he was “startled” to see the amount of force often employed by federal agents, noting it was “disproportionate to the level of criminal conduct we are seeing down there.”\n \n\n   \n  The use of force against demonstrators has at times threatened the safety of nearby Portland officers, Schoening added. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning.\n \n\n   \n  “Officers face safety risks themselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful  response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “The agitators coordinate their activity, including their information-gathering techniques.”\n \n\n   \n  The government also dismissed the state’s claim that National Guard presence escalates the tensions on the ground, saying there is no substantive evidence that has occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00Z","title":"In Tokyo, Trump and Takaichi bonded over a mutual friend – and a mutual enemy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a highly anticipated meeting in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi displayed a warm, personal rapport, reminiscent of the close relationship between Trump and former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

mutual friend – and a mutual enemy \n       \n  Analysis by Hanako Montgomery, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:58 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  During their closely watched  first meeting  in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Sanae Takaichi looked more like old friends than world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  There were smiles, back slaps, hugs and even a joke about running late because they’d been watching the LA Dodgers – led by Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani – play in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The US president received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination (the second of his Asia trip), and a golf putter previously owned by the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump on the green.\n \n\n   \n  Their easy camaraderie continued at the Yokosuka naval base, where Trump invited  Takaichi  on stage aboard the USS George Washington and praised her leadership. The new Japanese PM responded with a triumphant fist pump and a twirl, a moment that quickly went viral in her country.\n \n\n   \n  The message was unmistakable: the  Abe-era chemistry between Washington and Tokyo  is back.\n \n\n   \n  “She is a delight,” Trump told business leaders at the conclusion of the day’s activities. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not often Trump shows this level of warmth toward a foreign leader, particularly one from a country that’s weathered his tariff wars. It’s just as rare to see a Japanese prime minister display such open affection on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  It certainly helps that the two see eye to eye on several political issues. Both are right-wing conservatives who support military buildup and a tougher stance on China. Their shared connection to Abe also helps explain their rapport. Abe was one of Trump’s “best friends” in global politics, as well as being Takaichi’s political mentor.\n \n\n   \n  But beneath the photo ops and nostalgia also lies a strategic alliance born of mutual need. Especially as both leaders eye the same adversary in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, having a staunch ally in the Asia-Pacific region willing to take a hard line against China is an undeniable win. Takaichi, a longtime China hawk, has criticized Beijing’s military expansion and economic coercion for years. Her hardline stance dovetails neatly with Trump’s “America First” worldview.\n \n\n   \n  The two also unveiled a new framework on rare earths, aimed at reducing dependence on China’s near-monopoly over critical resources. Details were vague, but the message of cooperation was clear. Japan still remembers the 2010 “rare earths shock,” when Beijing cut off exports after a territorial dispute. Takaichi has since made securing stable supply chains a key part of her economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Trade and investment also featured prominently at the summit. Japan pledged roughly $490 billion in US-bound investments, led by companies in AI, semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing, part of a broader trade deal already agreed upon by the allies in September.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, who prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights, an allegiance to Japan solidified early in his first term. Abe took great care to develop the US-Japan relationship, at a time when the president did not have a lot of support on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  Foreign dignitaries and leaders  openly laughed  at the president during a 2018 United Nations General Assembly address. In 2019, a group of NATO leaders were  captured  on camera gossiping about him.\n \n\n   \n  But Abe cultivated his American counterpart with thoughtful gestures that played directly to Trump’s interests: multiple golf outings, the pomp and circumstance of a state banquet, and a trip to a sumo wrestling tournament where Trump bestowed the winner with a “President’s Cup.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remained close to his counterpart until Abe’s assassination in 2022, and hosted his widow at Mar-a-Lago last year.\n \n\n   \n  That goodwill paved the way for Takaichi’s success on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “He really likes her,” said a senior Trump administration official who observed their interactions behind closed doors.\n \n\n   \n  She also benefited from timing: Takaichi took office after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs rocked markets and reimagined US alliances – shielding her from tangling with the Trump administration to negotiate a trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  For Takaichi, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump strengthens her hand at home. Her approval ratings soared after taking office, but her ruling party still lacks a parliamentary majority after recent election losses. Public frustration over past scandals also lingers. Projecting Japan’s influence abroad, and reaffirming its bond with Washington, helps her rebuild political capital.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the optics are just as valuable. Hardening a close alliance with Tokyo gives him diplomatic momentum ahead of a more contentious meeting with China’s Xi Jinping. It’s also a reminder to Beijing that he’s not short on powerful friends in the region.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/nebraska-cornhusker-clink-ice-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"An undocumented mother says ICE raids and ‘Cornhusker Clink’ are the end of the Nebraska she’s called home for decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how Nebraska, once known for its welcoming immigrant communities and refugee resettlement programs, is undergoing a dramatic shift due to federal immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump.

for decades \n       \n  By Nayeli Jaramillo-Plata, Amanda Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alejandra doesn’t leave her home unless she really needs to. She skips doctor’s appointments and church to remain undetected. And if she is detained by immigration enforcement officials, her 13-year-old son is prepared with a list of people to call and his social security number memorized.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot be separated from my kids,” said the 30-year-old undocumented mother of four children who were born in the United States. “I just can’t risk it.” CNN agreed to only use Alejandra’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns due to her immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  The idea that her family might be ripped apart only crossed her mind recently, she said, when President Donald Trump’s nationwide  immigration crackdown  penetrated the humble, quiet Nebraska community she calls home.\n \n\n   \n  In June, a  meatpacking plant in Omaha  was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in what the agency described as the  largest worksite operation  in the state since the start of the Trump administration. Alejandra says several family friends and church acquaintances were among the dozens of people detained.\n \n\n   \n  As that event continues to generate aftershocks, a new ICE detention center, dubbed the  “Cornhusker Clink,”  is opening in western Nebraska soon and is expected to hold up to 300 adults, a spokesperson for Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen of as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and a later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti, and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside. I’ll get everything that we need. And if anything happens, you go, but you drive away,’” Alejandra recalled her son telling her. “I know who to call.”\n \n\n   \n  As she looks towards the future, Alejandra wonders what kind of future awaits her young sons, especially if the Nebraska she knows continues to transform and align with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Like her parents, Alejandra says she may be forced to leave the state, and everything she knows, in exchange for a stable and happy life.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/china-sends-youngest-astronaut-to-space-station-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:03:00-04:00","title":"China Sends Youngest Astronaut and Four Black Mice to 'Heavenly Palace' Space Station","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China successfully launched its Shenzhou-21 spacecraft, carrying three astronauts — including the youngest members of its astronaut corps, Zhang Hongzhang and Wu Fei — to its permanently inhabited Tiangong space station.

But experts broadly emphasize the safety and benefits of fluoride.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way. The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water  one of the 10 greatest health interventions in America  in the 20th century alongside vaccination, family planning and safer workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Most US residents live in a community where fluoride is added to public drinking water, according to  federal data  from 2022. In places where fluoride is not in the water, fluoride tablets or drops may be prescribed for babies and children to reduce the risk of tooth decay — and reliance on fluoride supplements could become more common, as Utah and Florida became the first states to  ban the practice  of adding fluoride to drinking water and similar legislation has been introduced in several other states.\n \n\n   \n  In April, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Environmental Protection Agency Administration  announced  that they would study the science to make a new recommendation on fluoride. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he will tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in communities.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA launched a ”safety review and public comment period” on the issue in ​May,   ﻿and a  strategy report  from the MAHA Commission – with an agenda spearheaded by Kennedy – specifically named fluoride supplements as an issue to investigate, along with vaccine injuries and exposures to pesticides and microplastics.\n \n\n   \n  In the resulting  scientific evaluation , published Friday, the agency concluded that fluoride supplements “should not be used in children under age 3 or by older children who are not at high risk of tooth decay.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,” the agency said in a news release.\n \n\n   \n  “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome. The microbiome is increasingly recognized to be central to a child’s health and development,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA on Friday also referenced “preliminary but potentially concerning” data about the risks that fluoride can have for children’s intellectual development. A  meta-analysis published earlier this year , which would become the basis for further federal investigation, concluded that IQ drops as fluoride levels rise. But some experts have raised concerns about biases in the analysis and emphasized that it focused on levels of fluoride that are far higher than most people are exposed to.\n \n\n   \n  As water fluoridation starts to roll back in some communities, experts say that protecting the option to use prescription supplements is key. In fact, the legislation in Utah that banned the addition of fluoride to the public drinking water included provisions to expand access to prescription fluoride — and  prescriptions spiked  after the change.\n \n\n   \n  For some oral health advocates, the latest action from the FDA is a win simply because it is not an outright ban.\n \n\n   \n  “We are actually quite pleased about this decision, because fluoride supplements remain available and will continue to be a benefit to oral health,” said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist from Utah who spoke at public meeting to discuss the risks and benefits of the prescription fluoride supplements in July.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that the decision of the FDA to continue making fluoride supplements available is an indication that all of the input generated from health professionals was heard and considered in their decision,” Bekker said in an email to CNN on Friday. “Providers can prescribe according to their consultation with parents and patients at recommended levels. We still recommend starting fluoride supplements at age 6 months in non-fluoridated water communities and will rely on knowledgeable health professionals to follow the documented science as they consider appropriate ages and dosages.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-strikes-pacific-drug-trafficking","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00-04:00","title":"Pentagon shifts to Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has shifted its military strike strategy in recent weeks to target suspected drug traffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, citing stronger intelligence linking cocaine trafficking from Colombia and Mexico to the U.S. market, in contrast to the Caribbean, where evidence of drug transport to the U.S. is weak.

After the first boat strike in September, for example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the vessel had likely been headed toward Trinidad and Tobago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is also not known to be a major source of cocaine for the US market, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the drug trade while accumulating a huge military presence near Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of the President, the Department of War is taking the fight to the cartels and defending our Homeland from Designated Terrorist Organization’s illicit activities before their violence and poison reaches our shores – this includes all of our nation’s borders,” a Pentagon official told CNN. “The Department’s newly established counter-narcotics Joint Task Force is expanding efforts on both the East and West Coasts to counter illicit drug trafficking by narco-terrorists using maritime routes.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not provided Congress with evidence to back up its claims that the 15 vessels the military has struck since September in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 61 people, were ferrying drugs and carrying known drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  During a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week, Pentagon officials also told lawmakers they do not know how to gauge success in the ongoing military campaign, according to a source familiar with the closed-door session.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t know whether there’s any data or metrics that would show (the strikes are) impeding the flow of drugs, whether there has been an increase in the price due to higher demand or lower supply, like there’s just no information,” the source said. “None of the briefers could say what they’re going to do when the traffickers change their tactics. None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.\n \n\n   \n  “They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an  unusual event in Virginia last month  that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.\n \n\n   \n  “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”\n \n\n   \n  Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to  US government data . By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.\n \n\n   \n  The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-numbers-trump-fact-check","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:05:00Z","title":"Fact check: Trump’s false claims about his poll numbers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump made false claims about having the highest and best poll numbers ever, both for himself and in comparison to other U.S. presidents, despite polling data showing a significant decline in public approval since late 2024.

But Trump also said two things about his popularity that are not even close to true.\n \n\n   \n  He said, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.” And he said, “I have the best numbers for any president in many years – any president.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s approval is down markedly from his second-term peak\n \n\n   \n  In reality, polls show that Americans’ approval of Trump has declined significantly since the beginning of his second term in late January. Multiple polling averages confirm that Trump’s poll numbers are nowhere in the ballpark of their highest-ever levels.\n \n\n   \n   A New York Times average  put Trump’s net approval at negative-11 points as of Tuesday: 43% approval and 54% disapproval. That is down a  net 20 points  from the first week of the term, when Trump was at positive-9 points – 52% approval and 43% disapproval.  CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, updated Wednesday, has Trump’s net approval at negative-15 points (41% approval and 56% disapproval), down a net 14 points from our first average of the term in early February.\n \n\n   \n  Other polling averages also show large drops in Trump’s standing since the beginning of the term.\n \n\n   \n  An  average produced by G. Elliott Morris , co-founder of the polling data website  FiftyPlusOne.news , put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-14 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 26 points from the first days of the term. An  average produced by data journalist Nate Silver  put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-10 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 22 points from the first days of the term.\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment for this article.\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth noting that Trump does continue to have  extremely high   approval   among Republicans , often in the vicinity of 90%. But he never said Tuesday that he was talking about his popularity with his own party rather than the country as a whole, and he is not at a personal record high even among Republicans in particular.\n \n\n   \n    Many other presidents had far better numbers\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current poll numbers are nowhere close to “the best numbers for any president in many years,” even if you ignore the fact that they’re not even his own best numbers in many years.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current low standing – a negative net approval, with approval specifically in the low-40s – clearly does not approach the  approval  peaks   of recent predecessors. President Barack Obama hit 69% approval in the early days of his first term, according to tracking by polling firm Gallup, while President George W. Bush hit 90% approval in the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Even President Joe Biden, who struggled with weak poll numbers for much of his term, was up at 57% approval in both January 2021 and April 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s claim is also wrong even if he was referring specifically to other presidents’ poll numbers on the same date of a term.\n \n\n   \n  Biden had low net approval on the equivalent day of his term, but it was still better than Trump’s in both  Morris’s average  and  Silver’s average . And Trump’s boast about beating “any president in many years” clearly suggested he was comparing himself to other presidents in addition to Biden; the data shows that  every other person elected president after World War II  had better poll numbers than Trump on the equivalent date in their ​first term, in both net approval and approval alone.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s  historical tracking  shows that, on the date Trump made this claim while having a roughly negative-10 net approval, Obama had about a positive-9 net approval in his first term, George W. Bush about positive-76, President Bill Clinton positive-2, President George H.W. Bush about positive-38, President Ronald Reagan about positive-20, President Jimmy Carter about positive-24, President Richard Nixon about positive-27, President John F. Kennedy about positive-65, President Dwight D. Eisenhower about positive-45, and President Harry Truman about positive-41.\n \n\n   \n  It would be fair to point out that Trump is serving a (non-consecutive) second term rather than a first term. But that added context doesn’t make Trump’s assertion correct. Gallup, which  assessed presidential approval on a quarter-by-quarter basis , found that, other than Nixon, Trump had a lower average approval in his 19th quarter as president – the third quarter of the second term, running from July 20 through October 19 – than any president elected to two terms from at least Eisenhower in the 1950s onward.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/middleeast/turkey-ski-resort-fire-sentence-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"Turkish court sentences hotel owner and 10 others to life for deadly fire that killed 78","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish court sentenced hotel owner Halit Ergul and 10 others to life in prison for severe negligence in connection with a deadly fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Bolu province on January 21, 2025.

But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/government-shutdown-billions-federal-aid-dries-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:59:00Z","title":"‘I feel guilty eating a meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, millions of low-income Americans are losing access to critical federal assistance programs such as SNAP (food stamps), Head Start (early education), and LIHEAP (home energy subsidies).

meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid \n       \n  By Isabelle Khurshudyan, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 3 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected.

So, if he asked me to come meet with him, I’d be in London tomorrow,” Sky Roberts told CNN in an interview on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  His comments come after the King took the extraordinary decision to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy this week amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re actually getting some acknowledgement from the King and saying he stands with survivors,” Roberts said, adding that the King’s response had been more positive than that of US authorities. “I think we should take a moment of appreciation for that but also call to action – to take it that next step further into an investigation, and to expedite that.”\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace declined to comment when asked about the idea of a meeting with Giuffre’s family.\n \n\n   \n  The statement released by Buckingham Palace on Thursday, which announced that Andrew would be  stripped of his titles  and honors, also said: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, accused  the King’s brother Andrew  of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:16 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One month after  Jeffrey Epstein  died in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, JPMorgan Chase   reported to   US authorities of more than one billion dollars in transactions it viewed as suspicious, according to newly unsealed court records.\n \n\n   \n  The notification was made on September 26, 2019, in a suspicious activity report, which is a kind of confidential report financial institutions file with the Treasury Department to flag potentially nefarious activity.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan’s report highlights over $1 billion in transactions Epstein engaged in from October 2003 until July 2019 with numerous related companies, Wall Street titans, his former lawyer and others. Two accounts included in the report were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.\n \n\n   \n  The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the unsealing of the records, which were part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements.\n \n\n   \n  The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global. Thursday, Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of stripping his brother Andrew of his prince title. The Justice Department remains under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers are taking depositions for their investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan bank, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein. This year, Staley  said  he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.\n \n\n   \n  Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.  None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities. JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarize financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.   “It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”\n \n\n   \n  In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.\n \n\n   \n  “After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Mr. Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, has asked JPMorgan for banking records and suggested officials turned a blind eye to Epstein’s conduct to make millions of dollars in fees from his accounts.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent response, the bank denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, writing, “with the exception of former JPMC executive Jes Staley, the bank’s executives (current and former) are respected professionals who acted with integrity and would never have allowed Epstein to remain a client if they knew of his ongoing crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Firm deeply regrets having had Epstein as a client and would never have continued doing business with him if it believed he engaged in ongoing criminal conduct,” the bank also said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/ohio-republicans-redistricting-map","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:52:00-04:00","title":"Ohio Panel and Virginia Lawmakers Move Forward with Congressional Redistricting Plans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Republican-dominated Ohio redistricting commission adopted a new congressional map that could strengthen Republican chances of gaining two additional seats in the 2026 elections, while Virginia’s Democratic-led legislature advanced a constitutional amendment allowing lawmakers to bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and redraw districts to their advantage.

Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of congressional midterm elections next year. The Senate on Friday passed a resolution that would allow lawmakers to temporarily bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and gerrymander their maps. The House had advanced it Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led legislature.\n \n\n   \n  The political parties are in an intense battle. Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, Republicans already hold 10 of 15 congressional seats. The new map could boost Republican chances in already competitive districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo. Kaptur won a 22nd term last year by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, in a district carried by Trump. Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n    Ohio residents criticize new map\n \n\n   \n  Ohio’s commission had faced a Friday deadline to adopt a new map, or else the task would have fallen to the GOP-led legislature, which could have crafted districts even more favorable to Republicans. But any redistricting bill passed by the legislature could have been subject to an initiative petition campaign from opponents seeking to force a public referendum on the new map.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of that legislative process provided commissioners of both parties with some incentive for compromise. All seven commissioners — five Republicans and two Democrats — voted for the new map.\n \n\n   \n  But Ohio residents who testified to commissioners Friday denounced the new districts. Julia Cattaneo, who wore a shirt saying “gerrymandering is cheating,” said the new map is gerrymandered more for Republicans than the one it is replacing and is not the sort of compromise needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, you are compromising — your integrity, honor, duty and to represent Ohioans,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Added resident Scott Sibley: “This map is an affront to democracy, and you should all — every one of you — be ashamed.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican state Auditor Keith Farber, a member of the commission, defended the map during a testy exchange with one opponent. Because many Democrats live in cities and many Republicans in rural areas, he said there was no way to draw a map creating eight Republican and seven Democratic districts — as some had urged — without splitting cities, counties and townships.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia Democrats point at Trump to defend redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans. Democratic lawmakers haven’t unveiled their planned new map, nor how many seats they are trying to gain, but said their moves are necessary to respond to the Trump-inspired gerrymandering in Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  “Our voters are asking to have that voice. They’re asking that we protect democracy, that we not allow gerrymandering to happen throughout the country, and we sit back,” said Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed constitutional amendment would let lawmakers temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The measure would still need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  The developments come as Virginia holds statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain said Democrats were ignoring the will of voters who had overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  “Heaven forbid that we actually link arms and work together on something,” Obenshain said. “What the voters of Virginia said is, ‘We expect redistricting to be an issue that we work across the aisle on, that we link arms on.’”\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, who has long championed the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission, noted the panel still would be in charge of redistricting after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not trying to end the practice of fair maps,” he said. “We are asking the voters if, in this one limited case, they want to ensure that a constitutional-norm-busting president can’t break the entire national election by twisting the arms of a few state legislatures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/white-house-lincoln-bedroom-bathroom-renovation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"Trump reveals renovated Lincoln Bedroom bathroom as his White House remodel continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the renovation of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom in the White House, replacing a 1940s Art Deco green-tiled design with black and white polished statuary marble, which he claims is more historically appropriate for Abraham Lincoln’s era.

\nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has renovated the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom, sharing before and after images on social media as he continues to put his touch on the  White House .\n \n\n   \n  “I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n \n\n   \n  The president posted about the renovations aboard Air Force One en route to Florida, where he will spend the weekend. The post comes as the government remains shutdown, and the Trump administration says it will not tap into emergency funds to fund SNAP food assistance benefits through the month of November.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, Trump posted more images of the bathroom, showing gold detailing on the faucet and shower handle, as well as other fixtures. A plush white robe with presidential seal also hangs on a golden hook.\n \n\n   \n  The president discussed the changes he was making to the bathroom earlier this month during a dinner at the White House, saying in part that the old style of the bathroom “was not exactly Abe Lincoln.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have little things like at the Lincoln Bedroom. The bathroom was done by the Truman family and you know, long time ago. And it’s done in a green tile, and it’s done in a style that was not exactly Abe Lincoln,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s actually Art Deco. And Art Deco doesn’t go with, you know, 1850 and Civil Wars…But what does do is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built a bathroom. It’s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time because the Lincoln bedroom is, uh, so incredible, for those of you that have seen it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday also gave a status update on a separate construction project he’s overseeing at the Kennedy Center, which he said he “just inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place! Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building. It is happening faster than anticipated, one of my trademarks,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail, but it will soon be beautiful again!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The moves are part of Trump’s effort to put his stamp on the White House – which has seen a slew of changes since he took office – and the greater DC area.\n \n\n   \n   So far, the renovations include paving over the grass in the historic Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing to make way for a new ballroom and adorning the Oval Office with gold.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often says the White House needed a new ballroom to host world leaders, to avoid situations where they are outside and a temporary tent has to be used when it rains. And he frequently remarked that the Rose Garden paving was necessary, because women in high heels would sink into the grass during events. It now has a touch of Mar-a-Lago with the same white and yellow umbrellas at tables on the patio.\n \n\n   \n  His  redecoration  of the Oval Office to his liking, as presidents do when they take office, has tripled the number of paintings on the walls with gold just about everywhere. Trump also installed portraits of every president framed in gold on the West Colonnade – except for former President Joe Biden who is instead represented by his autopen signature – and large floor-to-ceiling mirrors, which press can see when they are escorted into the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those changes, Trump plans to build a  new arch monument  in DC in honor of the country’s 250th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  As he pushes forward with his plans to leave his mark on the White House and the nation’s capital, Trump this week  fired the members  of the Commission of Fine Arts. The independent federal agency is charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics.” The president has also installed allies on the National Capital Planning Commission, which will be tasked with approving plans for the new ballroom on White House grounds.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/michigan-potential-terrorist-attack-averted-fbi","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"FBI Averts Potential ISIS-Inspired Terror Attack in Michigan During Halloween Weekend","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI thwarted a potential ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in Michigan during Halloween weekend by intercepting a group of individuals who had been communicating online about carrying out a violent attack.

boats are ‘unacceptable’ \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:11 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Associated Press\n \n   \n  The UN human rights chief said Friday that US  military strikes  against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.\n \n\n   \n  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Volker Türk , called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization.\n \n\n   \n  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”\n \n\n   \n  She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  US President  Donald Trump  has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes and the US military’s growing presence near Venezuela have stoked fears that the Trump administration could  try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Friday if he’s considering land strikes in Venezuela,  Trump said, “No.”  He did not elaborate as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he heads to Florida for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking earlier this week from the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump noted the US attacks at sea and reiterated that “now we’ll stop the drugs coming in by land.”\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.\n \n\n   \n  Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counterterrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.\n \n\n   \n  Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”\n \n\n   \n  The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/media/gayle-king-cbs-news-bari-weiss-ellison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"CBS News roiled by rumors, with Gayle King’s future the latest flashpoint","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CBS News is in the midst of a significant period of instability following the appointment of Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief, a move that has triggered widespread media speculation and internal anxiety.

But each story adds to the uncertainty and unease in the air. The latest one is about Gayle King, with Variety  reporting  that she is “expected to depart” her longtime TV home, “CBS Mornings,” next year.\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it would be news to King, whose contract doesn’t expire for another six months. She  told TMZ on Friday  morning: “All I’ve been told by everybody in this building is that they want me here, they like the job I’ve been doing… What I’m hearing in the building is not what I’m reading in the press.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the CBS News management team is in whack-a-mole mode, trying to tamp down the speculation — and probably trying to avoid any potential blowback from viewers.\n \n\n   \n  All the instability stems from David Ellison’s recent takeover of Paramount and  his decision to appoint  Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, the entrepreneurial and opinionated co-founder of The Free Press website, is an irresistible story to the media chattering classes. People both inside and outside CBS are desperate to know what she’s going to change at the storied news division.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, who has been on the job for just a few weeks, has been frustrated about the leaks relating to her arrival, according to a recent  New York Times report .\n \n\n   \n  She certainly deserves time and space to get to know CBS News and think through potential changes. But just this week, there have been stories about who Weiss may or may not want to keep at “60 Minutes;” who she may or may not want to hire for the “CBS Evening News;” and now, what might happen to the morning show.\n \n\n   \n  “You know the old adage: Nobody knows anything,” a CBS source remarked, pointing out that all the speculation is destabilizing in the meantime.\n \n\n   \n  The news division also  laid off about one hundred people  earlier this week, though the cuts were foreshadowed months ago, well before Weiss was hired.\n \n\n   \n    The morning show intrigue\n \n\n   \n  The CBS weekday morning show has undergone multiple permutations over the past decade, and King has been the central player throughout, helming the show while other co-hosts have come and gone.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Variety reporters Matt Donnelly and Brian Steinberg wrote that King is “expected to depart” the show and “may shift to a different role at the news division,” potentially with “a deal to produce her own programming for the network.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair also wrote that “negotiations are about to ensue,” which left some CBS staffers wondering: Is someone prematurely leaking that King is departing, and if so, why? Or is King privately telling people that she wants out, no matter what CBS offers?\n \n\n   \n  All the broadcast networks have been trying to lower salary costs in recent years, so there is little doubt that CBS would want King to accept a pay cut to stay at the network in any capacity.\n \n\n   \n  CBS responded forcefully to the Variety article, saying, “There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.” (And King told TMZ on Friday, “I am not going to negotiate in the media.”)\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a network to say when a star’s contract is up, but it showed that the typical window for negotiations hasn’t even opened yet.\n \n\n   \n  As Variety noted, “Moving King is a risky maneuver, especially because morning-TV is built on the relationships viewers build with the hosts.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s likely why CBS said in its statement that King is “a truly valued part of CBS and we look forward to engaging with her about the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Her co-host on the morning show, Nate Burleson, also commented personally on Instagram, reflecting how the uncertainty is weighing on staffers at the network.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope this rumor doesn’t hold up,” he wrote, calling King “a fixture, a force, and a part of the fabric of ‘CBS Mornings.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/senate-filibuster-trump-republicans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"Republican Leaders Reject Ending the Senate Filibuster Despite Trump’s Call to Nuke It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have rejected President Donald Trump’s call to end the Senate filibuster amid the ongoing government shutdown.

Republican leaders reject ending the Senate filibuster despite Trump’s call to nuke it \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The top two Republicans in Congress are showing no interest in taking the unprecedented step of ending the legislative filibuster, just hours after President Donald Trump  made a fresh demand  for the Senate to do so to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In perhaps the clearest possible signal to the White House that Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not change Senate rules to end the already 31-day stalemate, a spokesman said the Republican leader remained unmoved.\n \n\n   \n  “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesperson Ryan Wrasse told CNN, reiterating the long-time view of Thune and many others in Senate leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Even House Speaker Mike Johnson — who rarely breaks with Trump in public — offered a cautious warning about keeping the filibuster intact.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster has traditionally been used as a very important safeguard,” Johnson said, noting that his own opinion is “not relevant” given it is a Senate-only issue. But the GOP speaker warned that Democrats would use the move to pass extreme measures the next time they control the upper chamber.\n \n\n   \n  “They would pack the Supreme Court, they would make Puerto Rico and DC states. They would ban firearms. They would do all sorts of things that would be very harmful to the country,” Johnson said, stressing that Trump’s late-night Truth Social post on the filibuster was an “expression of the president’s anger at this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The rare split between congressional Republicans and the White House comes as the Washington stalemate and the pains of the shutdown around the country have deepened in recent days. But the GOP leaders’ swift move to quash Trump’s suggestion on the filibuster is a reflection of a clear political reality on Capitol Hill: There is little support for such a move within the Senate GOP conference.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Taking the so-called nuclear option would require near-unanimity, since Thune and Senate GOP leaders could only lose three votes from their own party to do so if all Democrats oppose the move. And the number of GOP senators currently opposed stands far higher than that, with at least a dozen Republicans on the record against it.\n \n\n   \n  Still, deploying the “nuclear option” would not entirely end the Senate’s filibuster. Instead, it would eliminate the 60-vote threshold to end debate, instead requiring 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  One of those lawmakers, freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah, made clear Friday morning that he remained opposed despite Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it,” Curtis wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Several GOP senators have echoed that sentiment in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through any rules change.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Roger Marshall called the idea a “non-starter” earlier this month, saying that “a republic protects the rights of the minority. Otherwise you just take a poll and you switch the direction the ship is going. So that filibuster helps protect the minority, and I think it’s served our country well.”\n \n\n   \n  Also earlier in the month, Thune himself ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end it.\n \n\n   \n  His team’s Friday statement reaffirming the leader’s opposition had some Senate Republicans breathing a sigh of relief, according to one GOP senate staffer.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” the GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-tomahawks-trump-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Pentagon Cleared to Provide Ukraine with Long-Range Tomahawk Missiles, Final Decision in Trump’s Hands","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has cleared the White House to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing no negative impact on U.S. stockpiles, but President Donald Trump retains the final political authority to approve the transfer.

Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has given the White House the green light to provide Ukraine with  long-range Tomahawk missiles  after assessing that it would not negatively impact US stockpiles, leaving the final political decision in President  Donald Trump’s  hands, according to three US and European officials familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said earlier this month during a working lunch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House that he would rather not provide the missiles to Ukraine because “we don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The Joint Staff informed the White House of its assessment earlier this month, just before Trump met with Zelensky   who has been pushing for the missiles to more effectively target oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia. Tomahawks have a range of around 1,000 miles.\n \n\n   \n  The assessment buoyed the US’ European allies, who believ e  that the US now ha s  fewer excuses not to provide the missiles, two European officials said. Trump also said just days before meeting Zelensky that the US has “a lot of Tomahawks” that it could potentially give to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  US and European officials were surprised, therefore, when Trump dramatically changed his tune days later, saying during opening remarks at a White House working lunch with Zelensky that the US “needs” the Tomahawks.   He then told Zelensky behind closed doors that the US would not be providing them — at least not yet.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s decision came one day after he spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Trump that Tomahawks could hit major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield but would damage the US-Russia relationship, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and Pentagon did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not taken the missiles off the table altogether, sources previously told CNN, and the administration has drawn up plans to provide them to Ukraine quickly should Trump give the order. Trump has also grown so frustrated in recent weeks with Putin’s unwillingness to seriously consider peace talks that he approved new US sanctions on Russian oil firms last week and scrapped — for now — a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest to discuss Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  While the Pentagon doesn’t have concerns about stockpiles, US defense officials are still grappling with how Ukraine would train on and deploy the missiles, officials said. There are still several operational issues that would need to be resolved for Ukraine to be able to use the missiles effectively, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  One outstanding question is how Ukraine would fire the missiles if the US provided them. Tomahawks are most commonly launched from surface ships or submarines, but Ukraine’s Navy is severely depleted ,  so the missiles would likely need to be launched on land. The Marine Corps and Army have developed ground-based launchers that could be provided to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But even if the US did not want to provide the launchers, European officials believe Ukraine could figure out a workaround. One official pointed out that Ukrainian engineers were able to develop a workaround to use the UK-provided Storm Shadow missiles, which were originally designed to be used by modern NATO aircraft and had to be integrated into Ukraine’s aging, Soviet-era fighter jet fleet.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X earlier this week, Zelenksy said Ukraine hopes to expand its long-range capabilities by the end of this year so the war can end “on fair terms” for the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Global sanctions and our pinpoint precision are practically syncing up to end this war on terms fair for Ukraine,” he wrote. “All deep-strike goals must be fully locked in by year’s end, including expansion of our long-range footprint.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/jetblue-flight-emergency-landing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00+00:00","title":"At least 15 people sent to hospital after JetBlue flight drops altitude, forcing emergency landing in Florida, officials say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A JetBlue flight (Flight 1230) en route from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced a sudden drop in altitude of about 100 feet in seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. ET, prompting an emergency landing at Tampa International Airport.

15 people, including children, were taken to the hospital following a sudden drop in altitude on a JetBlue flight that forced an emergency landing in Tampa, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Flight 1230 was heading Thursday from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, when it “experienced a drop in altitude,” JetBlue said in a statement, causing pilots to call for medical help. The plane diverted to Tampa International Airport around 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Aviation Administration said.\n \n\n   \n  The plane dropped about 100 feet in about seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. before making a more normal descent into Tampa, data from  FlightRadar24  shows. Medical personnel were there to meet the plane on arrival, an airport spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is investigating a “flight control issue” on the Airbus A320, it said, echoing a pilot’s message to air traffic controllers around the time of the brief descent. The National Transportation Safety Board is aware of the incident but has not started an investigation, the agency told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The flight disruption comes in a  volatile year  for air travel, with a major  midair collision ,  runway incursions  and  serious turbulence  already in play before the monthlong  government shutdown  raised staffing issues for  air traffic controllers  as the  holiday travel season  looms.\n \n\n   \n  Just before Thursday’s emergency, a strong cold front passed through Florida, leaving gusty winds and light rain showers. It was not immediately clear if weather was a factor in the flight’s altitude drop.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘flight control issue’\n \n\n   \n  While it’s unclear why the plane dropped in altitude, pilots told air traffic control the plane had experienced “a flight control issue,” audio from  LiveATC.net  indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Flight control failure is not without precedent for the Airbus A320, which has what’s called fly-by-wire controls: Control inputs from the pilot run through computers to trigger movements of the plane’s control surfaces.\n \n\n   \n  While the system is quite redundant, a failure about 30 years ago of the computer controlling an Airbus A320’s elevator – which controls its pitch: the up and down movement of the nose and tail – caused a Northwest Airlines plane to dive a hundred feet without any command from the pilots. The NTSB investigated that incident.\n \n\n   \n  As air traffic controllers on Thursday guided the JetBlue flight into Tampa, pilots reported injuries, including a possible “laceration in the head,” the audio indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Some 15 to 20 people aboard the plane were evaluated and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Tampa Fire Rescue spokesperson Vivian Shedd said.\n \n\n   \n  Two children and 12 adults were taken to Tampa’s St. Joseph’s Hospital with minor injuries, and all have been discharged, a hospital spokesperson said. No further details about injuries were available.\n \n\n   \n  “Our team has taken the aircraft out of service for inspection, and we will conduct a full investigation to determine the cause,” JetBlue said in its statement. “The safety of our customers and crewmembers is always our first priority, and we will work to support those involved.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Martin Goillandeau contributed to this reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/prince-andrew-scandal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:30:00-12:30","title":"King Charles Banishes Brother Andrew from Monarchy, Stripping Him of Title and Privileges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has officially removed Prince Andrew Mountbatten Windsor from royal titles and status, making him a commoner, in response to public outrage over his alleged ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, intensified by the release of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.

He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions). Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the King’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The King’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal sources have told CNN that he will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, and will receive an income from Charles as well.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move from his Windsor mansion to Sandringham in Norfolk until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source. The move will happen as soon as possible and practical, but the process of giving notice, surrendering the lease and other practicalities of the relocation can be a drawn-out process.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations with the rest of the Windsor clan.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has been living with Andrew at Royal Lodge for the last two decades, is moving out as well and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if the King’s actions will be enough to give a public perception that the situation has been handled, but Charles seems to be doing as much as he feels he can within his own royal prerogative.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/donald-trump-end-shutdown-filibuster","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-12:31","title":"Trump just kneecapped the GOP’s shutdown strategy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has publicly urged Republican leaders to invoke the 'nuclear option' to eliminate the Senate filibuster and end a prolonged government shutdown, arguing it would allow party-line votes to resolve the crisis.

This would allow Republicans to pass things on party-line votes in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it.\n \n\n   \n  So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president.\n \n\n   \n  But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend.\n \n\n   \n  The reason it’s unhelpful in this case is that it legitimizes Democrats’ talking point that Republicans could end this shutdown any time they want to. And that could make it harder for Republicans to shake the blame they’ve been saddled with.\n \n\n   \n  It’s been pretty remarkable how much Americans have  continued to blame Republicans  more than Democrats for the shutdown, despite it being Democrats who are seeking the concession (i.e. an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies). A  Washington Post-ABC News poll  released Thursday showed 45% of Americans mainly blamed Trump and the GOP, versus 33% who held Democrats responsible.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, the idea that Republicans could end the shutdown anytime they want is a vastly oversimplified talking point. Yes, all they need is a majority of the Senate to nuke the filibuster. But there are myriad reasons to avoid invoking that nuclear option. And Republican leaders have pointed to them for weeks — specifically invoking what they fear Democrats could do without that 60-vote threshold if they regain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month called the filibuster “a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.” (His spokesperson on Friday said the leader’s position is “unchanged.”) Fellow Senate GOP leader John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that nixing the filibuster would ultimately allow Democrats to make Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states, with two senators apiece, and to pack the Supreme Court. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would mean there would be “no stumbling blocks or hurdles at all in the way of turning us into a communist country.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is now legitimizing blaming his own party for the shutdown because they won’t have done the thing he told them to do.\n \n\n   \n  And if you’re a Republican in Congress, you’ve probably got déjà vu about now. That’s because Trump does stuff like this a lot – especially during shutdown debates.\n \n\n   \n  In early 2018, Trump  contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement  of support for a short-term continuing resolution, making a late demand to scrap an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then pulled another  11th-hour shift a few weeks later , demanding immigration concessions that hadn’t previously been a focal point of leaders’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Before he was sworn in to his second term in January, Trump and Elon Musk combined in December to play the role of legislative arsonists again. GOP leaders had negotiated a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. But then Musk started waging war against it on X. Trump then joined him and  threw another wrench in the cogs , suddenly demanding a debt ceiling increase that hadn’t really been a part of discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has regularly given congressional Republicans fits in these situations – so much so that they’ll occasionally acknowledge their frustrations publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2018  practically pleaded with Trump  to engage in the process and provide some direction. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,” the Kentucky Republican said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump threw a late grenade in the process in December, Sen. Kevin Cramer said he was “very frustrated.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN’s Manu Raju asked the North Dakota Republican if he wished Trump had signaled his demands earlier, Cramer  responded dryly : “Yeah, I mean, maybe he hadn’t thought about it until just today. But yeah, that would have been very helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  None of this means Trump’s late entry into this shutdown debate is a game-changer. Perhaps GOP leaders will get through to Trump that this strategy isn’t particularly helpful – as they appear to have with other Republicans who occasionally suggested this route – and he’ll drop it.\n \n\n   \n  But his late-night social media demand has at the very least put Republicans in the uncomfortable position of explaining why they don’t attempt to do the thing that is technically in their power to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And we’re already seeing Republicans try and massage this issue away.\n \n\n   \n  “What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, but most presidents don’t lash out and kneecap their side’s negotiating power just because they get frustrated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump calls for end of Senate filibuster to break funding stalemate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Senate filibuster as a way to end a weeklong government shutdown, which has now reached its longest duration in history.

And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said in a statement to CNN Friday, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.” The statement had some in his party breathing a sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” a GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   \n  Several GOP senators have echoed Thune’s sentiment in recent days in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through the rules change. Killing the filibuster would take a majority vote in the Senate, meaning Republicans could only lose three lawmakers assuming all Democrats oppose the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, Sen. John Curtis of Utah  posted on X  that he remained a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster, writing that “the filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to dismiss those concerns, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government. The president made a similar case during his first term, though Senate Republicans never acted on it at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend. The White House on Thursday also sought to highlight the stress that the shutdown is putting on air traffic controllers by convening a roundtable of airline industry representatives and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n   This story  has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/weather/noaa-hurricane-hunters-shutdown-unpaid-melissa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"Hurricane Hunters Fly Into Melissa Without Pay Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest on record with a 185 mph landfall in Jamaica, posed extreme challenges for NOAA’s Hurricane Hunters, who flew into the storm without pay due to a federal government shutdown.

They have done it around the clock, 24/7, because their mission is considered essential to public safety.\n \n\n   \n  But this time, with the government shut down, they have done it all without pay.\n \n\n   \n  The Hurricane Hunters are a standard feature of US storm response. Information gathered by the planes’ specialized equipment, which includes a tail-mounted doppler radar that takes a virtual CT scan of the storm, are crucial for issuing accurate forecasts and gauging storm strength in real-time.\n \n\n   \n  The data, including the radar information, is fed straight into the computer models that forecasters use to predict a hurricane’s path and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  But as long-lived Hurricane Melissa rumbled on through the week, the people operating the flights have been under increasing financial stress.\n \n\n   \n  The crews of the agency’s decades-old WP-3D aircraft have now missed two paychecks due to the shutdown, according to a NOAA employee with knowledge of the hurricane hunter operations, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n \n\n   \n  Crews are asked “To be fully mentally present, especially in this environment, and it’s hard to do that when you know you can’t potentially make ends meet,” the NOAA staff member said. “You’re dipping into savings to pay off your mortgage, you know, week to week or month to month.”\n \n\n   \n  The flights through the once Category 5 storm have been particularly hairy, with one of the NOAA aircraft having to return to its base for a safety inspection after exceeding its g-force limits from the turbulence.\n \n\n   \n  Videos during that flight show equipment falling from the ceiling of the plane, with roughly 20 crew members cursing and laughing as they are thrown against their safety harnesses.\n \n\n   \n  Following an inspection by ground crews, who are also working without pay, that same aircraft flew out later the same day on another mission into the storm, the NOAA staff member said.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA crews have met all the requests that the National Hurricane Center has made of them ,  the employee said. The Center assigns them to specific flight routes and schedules where scientists think in-situ data would improve the forecasts as much as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just a notable thing that we have these crews going around the clock supporting the important mission that it is,” despite enduring increasing financial hardship, they said.\n \n\n   \n  They said the NOAA flights have been fully staffed with about 20 crew members per flight.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA flights continued as the  storm plowed into Jamaica , doing immense damage to the island nation and killing at least 19 people.\n \n\n   \n  They have kept flying to support America’s international partners, with flights on Thursday aimed at making sure Bermuda residents get accurate warnings of the storm’s intensity and path.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster acknowledged the crews’ hard work and their financial stress. “NOAA looks forward to a swift end to the crippling federal government shutdown which is forcing essential workers and service members like our brave Hurricane Hunter pilots to go unpaid as they perform their mission-critical duties that protect the lives of Americans every day,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Air Force Reserve also flies into hurricanes and has flown numerous missions into Melissa, but those planes are not bristling with the same specialized equipment that the older NOAA aircraft are. They fly a more straightforward reconnaissance mission, keeping tabs of the storm’s intensity and movement, whereas the NOAA flights are aimed more at hurricane research and enabling forecasting improvements.\n \n\n   \n  Remarkably, one of the Air Force flights also had to turn around after getting beaten up by severe turbulence flying through Melissa. CNN reached out to the Air Force’s Hurricane Hunter squadron to inquire about their pay status but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unusual for two flights to have to turn back within the same storm and indicates the hurricane’s power during its approach to southwestern Jamaica. Melissa crossed the Jamaican coast tied for the strongest-ever landfalling Atlantic hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hazelton, a hurricane researcher who works with NOAA’s hurricane research division at the University of Miami, told CNN earlier this week that the NOAA flight that had to turn around due to turbulence was the roughest ride in a hurricane that he has had since he began such work seven years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “You hit a big enough updraft and downdraft you have to make sure the plane is ok,” Hazelton, who is being paid during the shutdown via the university, said. “These crews are doing this all while not getting paid, so they deserve all the credit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/andrew-mountbatten-windsor-what-next-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00.000Z","title":"‘Prince’ no longer: What next for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly Duke of York and a senior member of the royal family, has been formally stripped of all titles, honors, and royal privileges by King Charles III following sustained allegations of ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and sexual misconduct.

What next for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor? \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A fortnight ago, he was  Prince Andrew , Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Buckingham Palace announced that  King Charles III  had started a process to strip his brother of his titles and honors and evict him from the royal estate at Windsor, capping Andrew’s fall from grace over his ties to the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. By the next morning, Andrew’s name had already been removed from the official role of the peerage – a crucial step in the formal scrapping of his titles.\n \n\n   \n  While the royal family hopes this move can draw a line under this years-long scandal,  questions  are swirling about where Andrew, 65, will live, whether he could yet face more legal troubles and whether his banishment will appease the British public. Here, we answer some of those.\n \n\n   \n    Where will Andrew sleep tonight?\n \n\n   \n  Most likely in  Royal Lodge , the grand 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park, west of London, which has been Andrew’s home since 2003. The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, and his 75-year lease was due to expire in 2078.\n \n\n   \n  But in its Thursday night statement, Buckingham Palace said Andrew had been served formal notice to surrender his lease and that he would “move to alternative private accommodation.” It is understood that he will move as soon as is practicable.\n \n\n   \n    Where will he live in the future?\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources have told CNN that Andrew will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. That vast estate on England’s eastern coast is home to some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  It is also where the royal family spends Christmas. Before the Thursday night announcement, Andrew had already been told he would not be welcome at the country retreat over the holidays, a royal source had said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew might not move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, another source said, because giving notice, surrendering the lease and orchestrating the move is expected to take some time.\n \n\n   \n    Will he receive an income?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, but we don’t know how much. After he stepped back from public duties following his disastrous 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew was thought to receive an annual allowance of about £1 million ($1.3 million) from the late Queen, according to British media reports.\n \n\n   \n  Those payments initially continued under Charles, the reports said, but it is understood that the King had stopped providing the allowance.\n \n\n   \n  Despite now being stripped of his prince title, CNN understands that Andrew will still receive an income from Charles.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s finances have always been something of a mystery. His only source of income that has been declared is the pension he receives from his time in the navy between 1979 and 2001, said to amount to £20,000 ($26,000) a year.\n \n\n   \n    Is he still in the line of succession?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew may have lost his titles, status and honors but he is still eighth in line to the British throne.\n \n\n   \n  There is a process to formally remove him from the line of succession by legislation, but it would take time as it requires the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The last time this protocol was invoked was in 1936 with the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n    What will happen to his family?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996 but have lived together at Royal Lodge in Windsor since 2008. His ex-wife reverted to her maiden name earlier this month when Andrew relinquished the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. She is also moving out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements. It is understood that she will not be joining Andrew when he moves to Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  Their daughters, Princess Beatrice, 37, and Princess Eugenie, 35, are non-working royals and will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Beatrice lives with her husband in the Cotswolds, about 100 miles from London, but has an apartment at St. James’s Palace in the capital. Eugenie and her husband have a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace but spend a lot of time abroad. Their living situations will not be affected by their father’s exile.\n \n\n   \n    Could he be hauled in front of parliament?\n \n\n   \n  The Liberal Democrats, an opposition party, have lately called for Andrew to give evidence to a parliamentary committee about his finances and potential rent paid to live in Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to give members of parliament time to debate Andrew’s finances, despite public outcry for proper scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  This week, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate Commissioners seeking more information on Andrew’s lease arrangements for Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  That committee is responsible for “upholding best value for taxpayers’ money,” Clifton-Brown wrote, and as such “we feel it is reasonable to seek further information on the status of, and rationale for, the lease of Royal Lodge.”\n \n\n   \n    Might he face further legal challenges?\n \n\n   \n  Potentially. Republic, an activist group seeking to abolish the monarchy, says it is pursuing a private prosecution of Andrew “because if the government and police won’t hold him to account, we will.”\n \n\n   \n  The group says it has instructed lawyers to investigate and, if appropriate, begin a private prosecution over allegations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.\n \n\n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , a prominent accuser of Epstein and his circle, alleged that Andrew had sex with her three times when she was a teenager. In her recent memoir, published posthumously, Giuffre wrote that Andrew “believed that having sex with me was his birthright.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions of dollars to Giuffre in 2022 to settle a civil case she brought against him. He has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre died by suicide in April. On Thursday, Sky and Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s brother and sister-in-law, told CNN that Giuffre would have been “joyous” to know that Andrew had been stripped of the title that helped shield him from accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “I think she would be proud, and I think she would turn to her children and say, ‘I did it. I got the bad guy,’” said Amanda Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Will this be enough for the British public?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say. Andrew is deeply unpopular with the British public. In a poll published Thursday by YouGov, 91% of Britons had a negative opinion of Andrew. Just 4% had a positive one. By contrast, Britons generally like Prince William (76%) and Charles (62%), and overall have a positive view of the monarchy as an institution (56%).\n \n\n   \n  If Andrew’s fall from grace began in earnest after his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal family have repeatedly tried to draw a line under the scandal – first by Andrew’s withdrawing from public life, then by removing his military titles and patronages, later cutting him off financially, then by his relinquishing some of his titles – and now by the King casting him out of the palace for good as a pariah.\n \n\n   \n  None of the measures have quelled the public outcry. It remains to be seen whether this time will be different.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the Andrew scandal has roiled on for so long because, for the public, his “punishments” do not seem proportionate to the allegations that he faces. While the loss of his titles and favored residence may be a personal tragedy for Andrew, it elicits little sympathy from a public demanding proper accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t matter if he’s Prince Andrew or Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – we’re still pursuing a private prosecution of him,” said Republic, the activist group.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/sport/tennis-joao-fonseca-profile-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:34:00Z","title":"Teenage tennis star and ‘generational talent’ João Fonseca tempering power with patience as he ascends the sport","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"João Fonseca, a 19-year-old Brazilian tennis prodigy, has emerged as a rising star in men’s tennis thanks to his explosive forehand and two ATP Tour titles this year, including a win in Basel.

‘generational talent’ João Fonseca tempering power with patience as he ascends the sport \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:34 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ever since he first picked up a  tennis  racket,  João Fonseca  has shown a penchant for power – even if it came with mixed results.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the kind of kid that destroyed the ball,” says Fonseca. “Sometimes, it would go into the fence; sometimes, it would go straight to the floor; and then, sometimes, we’re doing a winner.”\n \n\n   \n  That approach – fearless, furious and unrestrained – has stayed with the Brazilian into his professional career, and today, his ripping forehand is one of the most breathtaking sights in men’s tennis.\n \n\n   \n  Few players can match the 19-year-old Fonseca when it comes to  raw power , particularly on the forehand wing. This not-so-subtle, not-so-secret weapon has guided him to two ATP Tour titles this year, including in the Swiss city of Basel last week.\n \n\n   \n  There, Fonseca thumped 29 winners to see off Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the final, while his average forehand speed was clocked at 81 miles per hour. For comparison, top players  usually average  around 75.\n \n\n   \n  “I think my coach was really the first one that said: ‘Keep with this aggression,’” Fonseca tells  CNN Sports  about his all-out approach. “‘Keep doing this, but at the same time, let’s work with being more solid.’\n \n\n   \n  “During these last years, I understood that you can’t hit the ball hard every time … Sometimes, it’s a stupid idea, of course, but sometimes, it’s good to be aggressive, to be courageous and have confidence in your shots.”\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Basel saw Fonseca become the third-youngest ATP 500 winner since the format was introduced in 2009, as well as the tournament’s youngest winner since Jim Courier in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Still a teenager, Fonseca’s potential is huge, his freakish power likely to become more of a threat as he develops and refines his game. To some, he is destined to join  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Jannik Sinner  – by far and away the standout players in men’s tennis this year – at the very top of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “The Brazilian Blaster (Fonseca) is a generational talent as I said 2 years ago and will be right there someday with the Italian Flamethrower (Sinner) and Spanish Magician (Alcaraz),” Rick Macci, the former coach to Serena Williams,  wrote  on X recently.\n \n\n   \n  Those players, Macci added, will “create a new big three” to replace Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n \n\n   \n  Davidovich Fokina spoke along the same lines during his runner-up speech in Basel, telling Fonseca that he is “for sure going to be the next Nole (Djokovic) to beat Carlos and Jannik.”\n \n\n   \n  After winning last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals title – a tournament featuring the world’s best players under 20 – Fonseca turned heads at the Australian Open in January with a straight-sets victory over ninth seed Andrey Rublev.\n \n\n   \n  He followed that up by winning the Argentina Open a month later, becoming the second-youngest South American to win an ATP title in the Open Era.\n \n\n   \n  But Fonseca’s progress hasn’t been exponential. He failed to progress past the third round of a grand slam this year, perhaps a surprise after the enormous promise he showed at the start of the season.\n \n\n   \n  The victory in Basel, however, reaffirmed his status as one of the most explosive talents in the game, with Fonseca climbing 18 spots up the rankings to No. 28. That puts him well on track to fulfill his self-ascribed objectives for next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of my goals is to be a seed, top 32 (at a grand slam),” says Fonseca. “It’s my personal goal. I’m working a lot to do it … let’s see how it goes.”\n \n\n   \n  To get to this level, Fonseca had to spend his formative years building a bond with tennis. As a young player, the game would make him feel restless, and he often found himself chasing big, haymaking shots on the court. He was even more impatient off it, unable to watch a full match without losing interest.\n \n\n   \n  That changed around 2019, when Fonseca sat absorbed as Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a  Wimbledon  final lasting four hours and 57 minutes – the longest final in the tournament’s history.\n \n\n   \n  A self-proclaimed Federer superfan, that match hurt Fonseca. As he started to enjoy tennis as a spectator, he would often watch the “Big 3” play out match after memorable match on the sport’s biggest stages, but it was the Swiss star who captivated him the most.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s my idol,” Fonseca confesses. Which goes some way to explaining why he suddenly found himself a sweaty, nervous wreck before meeting Federer for the first time in September.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a nice chat, about 10 minutes, and we talked a little bit about life, tour, how it is to live in Brazil and be far from home,” says Fonseca, adding: “He’s a super nice guy. You see these amazing players, these legends, as untouchable (and think): this guy is different. But no, he’s just a human being like us, super cool.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very important moment; it’s going to be in my mind for my whole life.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely that the two might cross paths again, particularly given that Fonseca is sponsored by On – the sportswear company in which Federer has invested and helped with product development. The Brazilian was only 16 when he was signed by On and earmarked as a star in the making, joining a roster that includes six-time grand slam winner  Iga Świątek  and world No. 7  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Several years earlier, Fonseca had made the decision to focus his sporting endeavors solely on tennis, not long after a  soccer  injury had left him sidelined for months.\n \n\n   \n  Like most kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro, soccer was, and still is, one of his great loves, even though his playing days have long since passed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a good level,” says Fonseca. “I’m a lefty leg, I had some skills, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t be professional or whatever. Fortunately, I stayed with tennis.”\n \n\n   \n  After reaching the quarterfinals of last year’s Rio Open aged 17, Fonseca decided to forego his college eligibility – he was holding a place at the University of Virginia – and turn professional.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, his march up the world rankings has been steady, quickly earning him an army of dedicated fans. Fonseca’s matches are some of the loudest on tour, and regardless of whether he’s playing in Brazil or further afield, yellow-and-green-clad spectators are guaranteed whenever he’s on a tennis court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s taken time, Fonseca admits, to grow accustomed to playing in front of such raucous crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, I was super nervous,” he says. “I needed to win, and there are people watching me, there are people cheering for me. The culture of Brazil is super loud, a lot of people supporting, I’ll say a little bit because of football.\n \n\n   \n  “I got used a lot to the crowd. Nowadays, I love playing with the crowd.

The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

Pitkethley added. “Just a huge amount of pride and gratitude to be recognized with this award.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what he believed was the secret to the Rosewood Hong Kong’s success, Pitkethley credited the staff at the $650-a-night hotel, which is located on the Kowloon waterfront in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an incredible team back at the hotel, who are not only passionate about hospitality, but really passionate about Hong Kong,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Describing this year’s list as “a true celebration of the very best properties from 22 destinations across six continents,” Emma Sleight, head of content for The World’s 50 Best Hotels, was full of praise for the Rosewood Hong Kong, which opened in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptional hotel offers world-class service and sensational guest experiences in the heart of one of the world’s most bustling and dynamic destinations,” said Sleight.\n \n\n   \n  “Rosewood Hong Kong’s positioning as No.1 further consolidates Asia as a leading luxury travel destination for both business and leisure travelers.”\n \n\n   \n    Asia dominates\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Four Seasons Bangkok at Chao Phraya River, a 299-room retreat located in the center of the Thai capital’s creative district, came in second place, closely followed by Capella Bangkok, which took third place on the list, which was heavily dominated by Asian hotels.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Passalacqua, a boutique hotel located in Italy’s Lake Como was the only non-Asian hotel in the top five. The 18th-century villa took fourth place this year, making it the highest ranked European hotel, and was also named the Best Boutique Hotel.\n \n\n   \n  Historic hotel Raffles Singapore, the birthplace of the Singapore Sling cocktail, rounded out the top five.\n \n\n   \n  Other hotels in the Asian region featured on the list included Mandarin Oriental Bangkok (No.7), Upper House Hong Kong (No.10), Bulgari Tokyo (No.15), Aman Tokyo (No.25), Janu Tokyo (No.37), Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong (No.41), and The Tokyo Edition Toranomon (No.45).\n \n\n   \n    Very best properties\n \n\n   \n  The highest ranked hotel in North America was Chablé Yucatán (No. 8), one of four Mexican hotels featured. A former 19th-century hacienda, nestled in the Mayan jungle, Chablé Yucatán is “inspired by nature, culture, and human connection,” said Diego Gutiérrez, CEO of Chablé Hotels, in a press release. The Mark in New York was a new entry this year, placing at No.43 and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles ranked at No.42.\n \n\n   \n  Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, which also won the Lavazza Highest New Entry Award, and Rosewood São Paulo were the only South American hotels on the list, placing at No.11 and No.24 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Dubai’s Atlantis The Royal, No.6, was the highest ranked hotel in the Middle East, while Capella Sydney, No.12, beat out the competition for the Oceana region. At No.13, Marrakech’s Royal Mansour was the highest ranked hotel in Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The World’s Best Hotel list is decided by the World’s 50 Best Hotel Academy, which is made up of 800 hotel industry experts, including hoteliers and travel journalists, spread across 13 destinations around the globe.\n \n\n   \n    The World’s 50 Best Hotels 2025\n \n\n   \n  1.

It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked by reporters in Malaysia on Friday about Trump’s post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would move quickly and work with the Department of Energy. He argued that “resuming testing is a pretty responsible” way to keep a “credible nuclear deterrent.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/africa/tanzania-opposition-dispute-election-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00-04:00","title":"Protests Spread in Tanzania Over Disputed Election Amid Allegations of Political Repression and Authoritarianism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Tanzania, a disputed presidential election has sparked widespread protests as citizens and international observers accuse the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party of suppressing opposition candidates, using enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, and internet censorship.

The sight of soldiers patrolling the streets, sporadic gunfire and closed stores is rare in the usually peaceful country that many foreigners visit for its pristine coastal beaches and safari tourism.\n \n\n   \n  That’s partly because Tanzania’s first female leader, who has served as president since 2021, has sparked widespread anger for  running virtually unopposed  after her two main opponents were blocked or prevented from contesting.\n \n\n   \n  President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who seeks five more years as president, ran against 16 candidates from smaller parties.

Hassan is now the subject of a range of uncharitable cartoons, posted on social media, derided as a dictator and lampooned as being afraid of competition.\n \n\n   \n  Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from standing.\n \n\n   \n    Political maneuvering\n \n\n   \n  At stake for the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party, or CCM, is its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hope to lead the country toward political change.\n \n\n   \n  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, or ACLED, a nonprofit tracking violence and protest movements around the world, describes CCM as the “last of the hegemonic liberation parties,” trying to cling to power by blocking the opposition “through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means.”\n \n\n   \n  The pattern includes enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings, according to Amnesty International. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited  more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019 , saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.\n \n\n   \n  Internet access has been on and off since Wednesday as the nation awaits official results.\n \n\n   \n  Tanzania’s president has “overseen an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.”\n \n\n   \n  Local police even appeared to be “conducting so-called online patrols,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is unprecedented even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.\n \n\n   \n  Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\n \n\n   \n  In Uganda, the opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is the leader of what began as the “People Power” movement, which aims for a break with nearly four decades of the same leader. President Yoweri Museveni took his lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2021 election, marking the 43-year-old Wine as a formidable national leader.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, young people have been trying to hold President William Ruto accountable over official corruption and his alleged failure to keep campaign promises. Last year and earlier this year, they held demonstrations in the capital Nairobi that were so large and persistent that Ruto deployed the military to restore order.\n \n\n   \n  In  Mozambique  a year ago, violence erupted in the streets after the opposition figure Venâncio Mondlane brought his supporters to the streets of the capital Maputo following a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  In  Madagascar  earlier in October, protests by mostly young people helped overthrow the government of President Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country after an elite group of the military joined crowds protesting water and electricity cuts.\n \n\n   \n    Tanzania is an outlier\n \n\n   \n  But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since independence from Britain in 1961, a remarkable streak that Hassan is trying to extend as opposition leaders try to break CCM’s grip on the country.\n \n\n   \n  CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or ten years. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as vice president without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly after the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The orderly transition sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support, especially among rural voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/billie-eilish-billionaires-donation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:51:00-04:00","title":"Billie Eilish Urges Billionaires to Give Away Money After Announcing $11.5 Million Philanthropic Donation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Billie Eilish, a Grammy-winning musician, announced a $11.5 million donation from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour proceeds to support initiatives in food equity, client justice, carbon pollution reduction, and climate crisis mitigation.

Washington blame game rages as pain grips needy Americans \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The air is turning blue over the Capitol Dome. And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made his first intervention in the shutdown drama since returning from a trip to Asia,  calling on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster  — the device that requires 60 votes to pass most major legislation and currently represents the only brake on his power that Democrats have in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Such a move would allow Republicans to open the government while bypassing Democratic demands. But it would open the possibility that Democrats could pass into law sweeping progressive reforms and roll back swaths of the conservative agenda if they control both chambers of Congress at some point in the future. Trump may not care what happens when he’s no longer president, but eliminating the filibuster would represent a fundamental political shift.\n \n\n   \n  This new wrinkle in Trump’s strategy will no doubt pile more pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And while Trump can shift his position from one moment to the next, his new gambit may indicate he’s more interested in crushing Democrats than seeking a way out of the increasingly damaging shutdown. Republican leaders in both parties have stated they don’t support ending the filibuster because of the implications for any future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling in the current shutdown   is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies.\n \n\n   \n  Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said that staying in town for another weekend waiting for Democrats to come to the table “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to  rage at Democrats  in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting as well as to correct Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ state, Wyoming. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:34:00-04:00","title":"Teacher shot by a 6-year-old student thought she was ‘on my way to heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abby Zwerner, a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student on January 6, 2023, during a classroom session.

heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony \n       \n  By Cindy Von Quednow, Chris Boyette, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:34 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Abby Zwerner instinctively raised her hand toward her heart when she saw the 6-year-old holding the gun.\n \n\n   \n  After the bullet hit her, “I thought I was on my way to heaven or in heaven,” Zwerner  testified  Thursday during her civil case against a former school official accused of neglecting warning signs the student   had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” Zwerner said with a catch in her voice as she recounted the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s   “blank look” as he aimed at her is a memory Zwerner said she can’t shake.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million  lawsuit  against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Parker also faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in the criminal trial against her next month.\n \n\n   \n  The case offers a window into what to expect for the upcoming criminal trial against Parker. Both trials raise questions about who is responsible when children with access to guns carry out school shootings, a pervasive problem across the country.\n \n\n   \n  As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned from Zwerner’s moving and highly anticipated testimony.\n \n\n   \n    Effects of shooting linger\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to do everyday things like open a bottle of   water.\n \n\n   \n  “I was trying to open the bag of chips on my own multiple times, different ways — trying to hold it different ways,” she testified about a recent lunch with her attorney. “And I eventually asked you to open it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified this week.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner struggled to describe how she now feels around people, even loved ones, but indicated she feels a “distance” and “numbness.”\n \n\n   \n  Psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified Thursday Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  Even a planned outing to the movies to see “Hamilton,” which features a duel scene with guns, became an overwhelming task that left her in tears, Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n  When her mother asked her what she wanted to do instead, she felt resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember saying or telling them, ‘nowhere, like I can’t go anywhere. I just want to stay home,’” Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n    Defense tries to undercut teacher’s testimony\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination Thursday, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims that the shooting has limited her willingness to go out in public.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had been emotionally ready to attend concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, her doctor had cleared her to do light workouts and she tried her best to do that with weights, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  The defense also pressed Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done after learning of the possible gun threat.\n \n\n   \n  Another school staffer told her about the boy potentially having a gun and she did not inform Parker because she knew the other staffer was going to, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys are trying to paint a picture that Zwerner may have been “a little bit at fault” for not acting on information that she had, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “That can be the basis for the defendant not being held negligent and having to pay damages, even if the defendant is more at fault, or mostly at fault,” Brown said .   \n \n\n   \n    What’s next\n \n\n   \n  The jury will reconvene Monday morning in the ongoing civil trial — which could be a roadmap for what’s to come with the criminal litigation against Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Holding civil cases before criminal ones is “really unusual,” Brown said. It may be because Parker waived her right to a speedy trial, and because the defense wants it that way, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  While Zwerner’s pain and suffering have taken center stage in this trial, the upcoming   criminal trial would be more likely to touch on what action Parker failed to take, given her duty to protect children, Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “The more important evidence for the prosecution would be from other witnesses and sources that reveal what the defendant knew with respect to the threat the child posed, and whether he had a gun,” the professor said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/tech/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:05:00-04:00","title":"Big Tech Keeps Splurging on AI.

Big Tech keeps splurging on AI. The pressure is ramping up to show why \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:05 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Silicon Valley’s mega AI spending spree isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.\n \n\n   \n  That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over more   on capital expenditures, like   leases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.\n \n\n   \n    AI spending continues to soar\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.\n \n\n   \n  And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.\n \n\n   \n  The dollar amounts involved are staggering.\n \n\n   \n  Google expects to   spend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spending   up 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.\n \n\n   \n  And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – and   expects to increase that in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.\n \n\n   \n  Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street wants big answers from Big Tech\n \n\n   \n  But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.\n \n\n   \n  Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”\n \n\n   \n  “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.\n \n\n   \n  On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.\n \n\n   \n  Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google’s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from ads   below and within the AI responses as with traditional search.\n \n\n   \n  The answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its “conviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,” while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter “more optimistic” about Google’s core business and that Meta “remains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.” Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Microsoft is “hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.”\n \n\n   \n  But that’s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world’s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta’s social media apps or Google’s search engine, according to Otto.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,” said SuRo Capital’s Evan Schlossman. “You have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/broadview-ice-facility-illinois-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:45:00-05:00","title":"Advocates allege ‘inhumane’ conditions at Chicago-area ICE facility in new lawsuit","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Advocacy groups, including the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center, have filed a lawsuit alleging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are operating the Broadview detention facility in the Chicago area in inhumane conditions.

Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit, said community members are “being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and

the facility’s conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates have  for months  raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and

\nUpdated: \n        9:43 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have found a way to test  ancient human  remains for hormones linked with pregnancy, a breakthrough that may allow archaeologists to determine whether a woman was pregnant or had recently given birth at the time of her death.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers found key reproductive hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in hard tissues, such as the bones and teeth, of skeletons dating back as far as 1,000 years, according to a study published October 2 in the  Journal of Archaeological Science .\n \n\n   \n  “We found a ‘hormone archive’ in skeletons and teeth,” said lead study author Aimée Barlow, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, northern England.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a first. Nobody has ever detected these specific hormones in teeth or dental calculus before,” Barlow told CNN. “It is also the first time progesterone has been successfully measured in human bone tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  Pregnancy is difficult to detect in ancient human remains, and scientists previously believed that the composition of hard tissues was so overwhelmingly inorganic that these proteins would not be preserved or detected, Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, she decided to test a number of samples from seven female and three male skeletons dating from the first to 19th centuries using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA is an existing technique used to detect and quantify peptide and protein molecules such as progesterone, a key biomarker for pregnancy, the levels of which increase significantly during the first trimester and are maintained throughout.\n \n\n   \n  Levels of estrogen and testosterone also rise, although not to the same extent, meaning that it was important to also consider the relationship between the three hormones, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The tests revealed that estrogen, progesterone and testosterone were measurable in bone, and dentin, enamel, calculus and root samples from teeth. “High progesterone levels in dental structures and calculus, the presence of oestrogen in bone, and a lack of testosterone in hard tissues was consistent with pregnancy at the time of death,” the study authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  This demonstrates “the feasibility and significant potential of the ELISA method for the detection of sex hormones in human skeletal remains to examine the reproductive histories of past populations,” according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Barlow said proving that the skeleton can preserve hormones would, with many years of further study, potentially allow researchers to determine the age at which a woman first became pregnant, whether she experienced pregnancy loss and how much time had passed between births if she had multiple children.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be especially useful for historical periods where no written records exist,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  More work is needed to fully develop the technique for use on ancient remains, she said, including establishing a baseline of hormone levels in skeletal tissues by conducting a much larger study that also involves living individuals with detailed medical records.\n \n\n   \n  “Secondly, we need to understand the fundamental science. We need to learn how these hormones get incorporated into and stored within these different tissues,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  “And we need to explore how these hormones are preserved and broken down (degraded) over time in different burial environments.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundbreaking’ findings\n \n\n   \n  Nikolas Lemos, professor of forensic medical sciences at Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that “this is a pioneering study … which has achieved a world-first.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemos underlined that the sample size was “very small,” with only two of the 10 individuals pregnant at death, adding that the ELISA method requires “further testing and validation.”\n \n\n   \n  “In short, while the findings are groundbreaking, they should be viewed as proof of concept, not yet as a routine diagnostic tool,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the work is still in its early stages, it represents a remarkable step toward understanding the intimate, hormonal dimensions of life and death in the distant past,” Lemos added.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander Comninos, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said that the research was “fascinating.”\n \n\n   \n  “By understanding reproductive profiles of the past, this can provide insights into how these may have changed over time and perhaps glimpses of the future,” he told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, the ability to identify these key hormones in bone can trigger further contemporary work in the bone field,” Comninos added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/travel/halloween-decorations-st-jude-fundraiser","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"This Veteran’s Halloween Spirit Gave Him a New Purpose.

We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better.

football coaches are setting off alarm bells \n       \n  By Dana O’Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The placard attached to the podium read “Protecting the most vulnerable,’’ but on this particular Wednesday Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry took aim at a very specific apex predator: Big-time football.\n \n\n   \n  The governor, who was supposed to be talking about  food stamps that are nearing a crisis point due to the government shutdown , instead launched a verbal grenade directed squarely at the Louisiana State University Athletics Administration Building – aimed more specifically at the desk of athletic director Scott Woodward.\n \n\n   \n  Calling out not just the lack of success under football head coach Brian Kelly but the $53 million bill LSU now has to foot to give the coach his walking papers, Landry publicly defrocked Woodward, making it clear that the man in charge of LSU athletics would not be making the biggest hire for LSU athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “My role is about the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract,’’ Landry said after being asked about his role in Kelly’s dismissal after reports indicated discussions about the dismissal went all the way to the governor’s mansion.\n \n\n   \n  “I care about what the taxpayers are on the hook on, and I was not happy about raising ticket prices while we were having a losing season and we were paying a coach $100 million and not getting results.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t done there.  Landry told ABC  on Thursday that he plans to have the state’s attorney general review the next head coach’s contract “to understand what the extent under which the state is ultimately liable.”\n \n\n   \n  The remarks drew plenty of eye rolls. This is Louisiana, where Huey Long used his own gubernatorial position to influence LSU football nearly a 100 years ago. Pigskin and politics regularly mix.\n \n\n   \n  But in this case, Landry’s public tongue lashing resounded well beyond the reaches of the bayou, earning nods of approval in plenty of other far-flung circles of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, someone said it out loud,’’ said a board of trustees member at another institution. “This is so irresponsible.’’\n \n\n   \n    Buyout season\n \n\n   \n  LSU, after all, is not alone.  Since Oklahoma State fired Mike Gundy  on September 23 through Kelly’s dismissal one month later, 10 FBS schools have ousted their head coaches. Combined the coaches are owed $169 million, all coming at a time when college athletics is facing unprecedented costs.\n \n\n   \n  In June, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the $2.8 billion settlement coming from the so-called House settlement, requiring colleges to directly share revenue with their athletes. The estimated House payouts this year is $20.5 million. That will only go up annually.\n \n\n   \n  It has left plenty of university administrators equal parts dismayed and disgusted at what they believe is nothing shy of fiscal malfeasance, with schools hamstrung by deals presented as security blankets for the university but offering only protection for the coaches.\n \n\n   \n  “No one is flying the plane,’’ a board member at one of the schools affected said. “There’s not even a plane. It’s a hot air balloon. Whatever way the wind blows, that’s the way college sports go.’’\n \n\n   \n  That college football is spending at an unprecedented pace is not new news. Arguing a very expensive need to keep up with the Joneses (or maybe more accurately the Sabans and Meyers) to succeed, coaches long have asked for bigger, better and more.\n \n\n   \n  Facility one-upsmanship, all in the name of attracting better recruits, led to practice facilities with mini-golf courses (Clemson), marble showers in the locker room (Oregon) and sensory deprivation tanks (Georgia). Then came more staff – to run the analytics and sports performance and nutrition and, in some cases, the head coach. Texas has not one, not two but three special assistants to the head coach.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, when simply ballooning coaching contracts was no longer enough, the deals also had to be guaranteed, lest another school poach your leader.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the season, nine head coaches were making more than $10 million annually, according to the USA Today head coaches database, and 12 had buyouts totaling more than $40 million, topped by Kirby Smart’s $105 million owed should Georgia decide to can him.\n \n\n   \n  Except now, as some of those bills come due at the same time revenue sharing comes into existence, the very real question is no longer an existential crisis. Just where is the money coming from?\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea,’’ said another board member at an affected school. “The money does not exist.’’\n \n\n   \n  That startling and yet very real revelation flies in the face of what has long been the presiding sentiment about college football: That it is the big money meal ticket for an athletics department.\n \n\n   \n  For years it was not bottom-line accurate —rare was the department that ran in the black – but at least true in theory. Thanks to TV rights packages and tens of thousands of fannies in the seats on fall Saturdays, college football did draw the biggest paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  Except somewhere along the line the spending steamrolled ahead of the profits.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No one has the answer’\n \n\n   \n  Consider two of the schools on the hook for two of the biggest coaching buyouts: Penn State, which owes  James Franklin $49 million  and LSU, on the hook for $53 million for Kelly.\n \n\n   \n  According to the KnightNewhouse College Athletics Database, in the last 10 years Penn State’s football spending has jumped 113% but the entire department’s revenues have grown only 83%. At LSU, football spending jumped 44% and revenues just 40%.\n \n\n   \n  In the same decade, football coaching salaries (the entire staff) jumped 106% in State College and 90% in Baton Rouge while ticket sales only added an additional 33% and 37% respectively and donor contributions jumped 53% and 66%.\n \n\n   \n  The money owed can be mitigated. Most contracts include what are called best efforts clauses, which means the ex-coach can’t hole up in Cabo and get his entire paycheck. He has to look for a job, and should he land one, the salary owed will be less the salary gained.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like being divorced and paying alimony,’’ one of the board members joked. “You’re rooting for them to get remarried.’’\n \n\n   \n  But it is not simply the head coaches that need to be paid out.  The Advertiser i n Louisiana reported that offensive coordinator Joe Sloan, fired along with Kelly, is due $530,000. Penn State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles reportedly is in the first year of a three-year deal worth $3.1 million annually and offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki is making $2.4 million. It will be up to the next coach – who, by the way, will not come at a bargain-basement price – to decide if they stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile Penn State last year was on the hook for more than $900,000 in football coaching severance per the KnightNewhouse database, presumably due to Mike Yurcich, Kotelnicki’s predecessor who was fired in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft, who through a spokesperson declined comment for this story, has insisted that Franklin’s buyout is “an athletics issue. This is not the institution’s issue. We in athletics are covering the costs.”\n \n\n   \n  But from where? “No one has the answer,’’ one of the board members said.\n \n\n   \n    No signs of stopping\n \n\n   \n  Still, the race to the top of the money pile goes on.\n \n\n   \n  A pitch to turn to private equity for the Big Ten has at least temporarily stalled, in large part because of pushback from conference members USC and Michigan. Deep-pocketed donors are now being asked to foot the bill for coaching salaries, facilities improvements and – thanks to the House settlement – player contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Tech recently announced a planned $229 million investment in athletics over the next four years. Along with seeking donor support for $30 million of that annually, the university said there will be “limited increases in student fees.’’ In 2024, student fees generated $14.5 million for the athletic department.\n \n\n   \n  “That deal should terrify boards everywhere,’’ one of the trustees said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the logic gleaned from the accounting books arguing to the contrary, spending is showing no signs of stopping.  Curt Cignetti has done wonders  at Indiana, elevating a program that ranked somewhere below historically dormant to No. 2 in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  He has coached 21 games at Indiana – 21 at the FBS level entirely. And last week the school inked him to an eight-year, $93 million deal. It’s all guaranteed.\n \n\n   \n  And less than 24 hours after the governor undercut Woodward at LSU, the athletic director was, to no one’s surprise, negotiating his exit strategy from the school. That leaves the school without a university president (William Tate left in May to take the same position at Rutgers), no football coach and no athletic director.\n \n\n   \n  According to Yahoo Sports, Woodward is owed somewhere in the neighborhood of $6.4 million. The school is expected to honor the terms – another buyout on the Bayou.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/europe/dutch-centrist-d66-party-election-wins-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Dutch centrist D66 party confirmed as election winner, ANP says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the Dutch general election held on Wednesday, October 29, 2025, the centrist party D66 emerged as the leading party with approximately 18% of the vote, surpassing the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by Geert Wilders.

\n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For a logo with a trademark grin, Wendy’s has little to smile about nowadays.\n \n\n   \n  The burger chain’s stock has lost nearly 50% of its value this year. Wendy’s executive suite has contended with several departures, and it’s currently operating without a permanent CEO after its previous leader abruptly left after just a year-and-a-half on the job. Plus, a confusing mix of promotions hurt sales last quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not happy with our sales performance,” Ken Cook, Wendy’s CFO and interim CEO, bluntly admitted on its most recent earnings call in August.\n \n\n   \n  The fast food industry is in a slump, and Wendy’s isn’t immune. Chief rivals McDonald’s and Burger King also reported sluggish sales earlier this year as consumers cut back spending. However,  both rebounded  over the summer and fall thanks to an increased focus on marketing and targeted promotions.\n \n\n   \n  Not so much for Wendy’s.\n \n\n   \n  US sales at stores open at least a year in the third quarter are forecast to fall 5.8% when the company reports earnings next week, according to Jim Salera, a research analyst for Stephens. That’s even worse than the 3.6% decline in the previous quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are really focusing on when the company can get same-store sales trends moving back in the right direction and we had seen little progress of that,” Salera told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s is being forced to take action, recently announcing an aggressive turnaround plan that aims to reignite sales. However, revitalizing a 55-year-old chain is not easy.\n \n\n   \n  McDonald’s, which has nearly triple the number of locations in the United States, found recent success with new deals and  menu items . McDonald’s recent growth has also eaten away at some of Wendy’s market share.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s sits in a “more of an elevated position where it’s not just focused on price,” Salera said, and is focused on quality. After all, the chain prides itself on its “fresh, never frozen” tagline for its patties, which has been  in use since its founding in 1969 .\n \n\n   \n  “But as consumers that are trading down or in some cases just trading out entirely and just skipping (fast food) occasions, McDonald’s is leading a lot more with price than an operator like Wendy’s,” he   added.\n \n\n   \n    Back to square one\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s recently announced a  “comprehensive strategic plan”  called “Project Fresh,” under the guidance of former Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s board of directors and management team are dissatisfied with the current valuation of the company and have been working to put the company on the right path to create value for our franchisees, employees and shareholders,” said Art Winkleback, chairman of Wendy’s board, in an October 9 press release.\n \n\n   \n  Plans include refreshed marketing to remind customers of its “rich heritage of quality, innovation and unique voice.” The company also intends to help franchisees improve profits and increase investments in restaurant technology, like digital menus, to “enhance the customer experience.”\n \n\n   \n  BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, however, doesn’t think Wendy’s plan is “tackling the root of the problem” and that its “issues go far deeper than some marketing changes or some menu adjustments.”\n \n\n   \n  Rather, he said that Wendy’s problems stretches back more than a decade to   a  remodel initiative  of its US restaurants that was meant to modernize the chain. Instead, the final product was “watered down a lot” from its initial plan because of several leadership changes.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s is now starting to talk about kind of a multi-year plan to install digital menu boards, which have been around for over a decade,” Saleh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For comparison, around the same time, McDonald’s  remodeled a vast majority  of its US restaurants, adding digital kiosks and refreshed interiors. The work was largely completed by 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “The biggest problem (Wendy’s) have is not their food … it’s (their restaurants) are old and tired,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Salera agreed that Wendy’s has a “solid offering” with its food. The chain recently relaunched its chicken tenders to  capitalize on the trend  for crispy chicken, and he complimented the  revamped Frosty  offerings to establish it as a “unique Wendy’s asset.”\n \n\n   \n  He said that the brand’s plan of “focusing and skimming down the number of promotions or limited-time offers is a positive (move),” especially after the variety of deals in the “100 Days of Summer” promotion proved to be  too complex  for customers to understand.\n \n\n   \n  Additional details of Wendy’s plan will be revealed during its November 7 earnings call.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"The ‘6-7’ Meme Can Be Annoying.

meme can be annoying. But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/disney-youtube-deal-biz-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-04:00","title":"Disney Channels Go Dark on YouTube TV After Media Giants Fail to Resolve Carriage Dispute","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney has removed its channels — including ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel, FX, National Geographic, and Freeform — from YouTube TV after failing to reach a new carriage agreement by the October 31, 2025 deadline.

Western intelligence says Iran is rearming despite UN sanctions, with China’s help \n       \n  By Melissa Bell, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:07 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran. The images then show the Barzin docked at Rajaei Port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, from October 16 to October 19, where it was being unloaded.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/maurizio-cattelan-america-gold-toilet-sothebys","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:33:00-04:00","title":"How much would you pay for an infamous gold toilet?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article recounts the story of Maurizio Cattelan’s infamous gold toilet sculpture 'America,' which first gained attention in 2016 at the Guggenheim Museum and was later stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.

Though the perpetrators  were convicted earlier this year , the fully functional, opulent toilet, titled “America,” was never found, believed to be cut up or melted down for the value of the gold itself, worth millions.\n \n\n   \n  But that isn’t the end of the saga for the satirical sculpture, which was once offered to President Donald J. Trump during his first term, in lieu of a Van Gogh painting requested by his administration (the counteroffer was  reportedly ignored) .\n \n\n   \n  Cattelan has previously stated he had made more than one edition of “America,” and now a second edition is making an unexpected, flashy debut on the art market next month.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s in New York will sell the work, which has been in private (and anonymous) hands since 2017, on November 18. That also means the sculpture will be back on public view for a limited time, when the auction house installs it in the fourth-floor bathroom of its brand-new headquarters for 10 days leading up to the sale. This time, however, visitors will not be able to use it, per Sotheby’s. Officially that’s for security reasons, though one can guess why else.\n \n\n   \n  “The door will remain open,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  Auctions typically have a set starting bid, informed by a number of market factors, as well as low and high sales numbers, estimated ahead of time. But the sale for this “America” will be worth its weight in gold — quite literally — as the starting figure will be its inherent value, fluctuating with the gold market right up until bidding begins. That will be somewhere in the $10 million range, according to the current value (with the price of gold lately  setting record highs ), plus whatever collectors deem its ascribed value to be.\n \n\n   \n  “The starting bid in accordance with the price of gold was really a way to lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” Galperin explained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a “perfect foil” to Cattelan’s other equally infamous banana-on-a-wall, “Comedian,” which  sold for $6.24 million at Sotheby’s last fall , Galperin added. The duct-taped banana, worthless without Cattelan’s association, first debuted at Art Basel Miami on a bare white wall, originally priced at $120,000.  It has been eaten more than once .\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Comedian’ was all about the intangibility of value and how we ascribe value to works of art, ‘America’ challenges that a step further by being in so many ways, intrinsically valuable, in a manner that so many works of art are not.”\n \n\n   \n  “America” is many things: a wry comment on the art world and the United States, as well as an object of torment for arts publicists and their lofty press statements. (The Guggenheim once described it as an opportunity for “unprecedented intimacy with a work of art.”) And this edition may actually be the only physical one in existence, according to Sotheby’s. Though the work is an edition of three, the auction house does not believe the third has been fabricated.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the sculpture’s dramatic history, Galperin said “America” is an important 21st-century artwork, one with a direct lineage to landmark Modern art (see: Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 upside-down urinal “Fountain”), but with critical relevance to today.\n \n\n   \n  “Cattelan, for his entire career, has critiqued the system,” Galperin said, “whether it’s the viewers’ experience seeing art in a museum, the way that works of art move through the system, the way that they’re valued, the way that they change hands.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these concepts are things that artworks so rarely confront head on. His ability to do that and do it in such a legible way and impactful way is part of its success here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:35:00-04:00","title":"'Hell on Earth': Ravaged by Hurricane Melissa, this once-vibrant Jamaican town is now in desperate need of help","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful storm that struck Jamaica in October 2025, caused catastrophic damage to the coastal town of Black River, reducing homes and infrastructure to rubble.

It’s the Department of Energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s own nominee to head the US Strategic Command seemed unclear of the president’s intent as he faced the Senate Armed Service Committee in a confirmation hearing Thursday. “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test,” Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll said, “so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out.”\n \n\n   \n  The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as “generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads,” and Russia’s missile and torpedo tests do not meet that strict definition. \n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Jon Wolfsthal, who advised both Joe Biden and Barack Obama on nuclear matters, notes other nations are already conducting similar tests – along with the US. “Russia, the United States, China are all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms – missiles, bombers, submarines,” Wolfsthal said. “We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump truly wants to resume nuclear weapons testing, analysts say the complications are deep and wide. For starters, almost every nuclear-capable country in the world has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades. Russia ran its last test in 1990, the US in 1992 and China in 1996. North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century, and that has contributed to Pyongyang’s status as an international pariah.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the diplomatic risk of standing up a fresh set of tests in the US, there are technical challenges. Federal studies have shown staging such a test safely would likely require several years of preparation, and even then, it might yield little useful information. The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding a treasure trove of nuclear knowledge unmatched by any other country.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say if Trump ushers in a new era of testing, that will only open the door for any other nation with nuclear dreams to start catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “The country that would benefit the most would be China,” Bunn said.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States,” said former Democratic congressman John Tierney, who now heads the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear weapons experts note that both Russia and China have stepped up their nuclear aspirations already. Some political analysts speculate that Trump is hoping to back them down with tough talk, a notion he seems to echo. “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” the president said. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of yet.\n \n\n   \n  But Tierney finds the president’s constantly shifting talk troublesome, to say the least. He fears in an already tense international environment, Trump is injecting more instability – which can prove explosive in its own way.\n \n\n   \n  “One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes,” Tierney says. “The next day he wants to start testing? It’s dangerous.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/antoni-porowski-sexual-health","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00Z","title":"Antoni Porowski Says Conversations Around Sexual Health Don’t Have to Be Awkward","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Antoni Porowski, best known for his role on 'Queer Eye,' is advocating for more open and non-awkward conversations about sexual health, especially STIs and HIV prevention, due to the rising stigma and political pushback against LGBTQ+ health initiatives.

says that conversations around sexual health don’t have to be awkward \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Many years before he became the resident foodie and one fifth of the makeover dream team on “ Queer Eye ,” Antoni Porowski already had no problem having important and frank conversations.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned about STIs probably before I hit puberty,” he told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  When Porowski later called out his physician father   for broaching the subject of sexually transmitted infections when he was quite young, his dad’s response was, “Well you know what, you had to know and you were going to find out at some point anyway.”\n \n\n   \n  Porowski – whose mother, sister and grandfather also have medical backgrounds – grew up around science and having conversations about health, sexual and otherwise, and he says he feels privileged to have had that access to helpful information early on. It’s one of the reasons he’s partnering with pharmaceutical company Gilead to promote HIV prevention and having open discussions about sexual health.\n \n\n   \n  “The more you talk about it, anything that’s uncomfortable, the less precious it becomes. It loses its power,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski’s involvement in the  campaign  comes at a time of  unprecedented  cutbacks on DEI programs, which among many other things contain efforts designed to help people realize and achieve sexual wellness through access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP, drugs that prevents HIV infections, which are produced by companies including Gilead) and other information. Analysis of federal data by the  New York Times  in May found that Donald Trump’s administration had scrapped more than $800 million worth of research into the health of LGBTQ+ people.\n \n\n   \n  “With all of these unfortunate initiatives, I think it pushes us more towards stigmatization, because it helps fuel the taboo and negative understandings and perceptions of a lot of things,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Often as we’re seeing in culture right now and in politics, the things that a lot of certain people are afraid of, they end up turning (it) into anger, and it then flips to taking away or minimizing rights because they just don’t get it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For Porwoski, the current political landscape and its challenges present an opportunity to “keep talking about this even more than we did.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because as much progress as we’ve made – progress isn’t linear, as I’m learning with a lot of things, especially politically,” he said. “The key for anything that is misunderstood or misperceived, I think it’s an opportunity to have a conversation about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Part of his understanding comes from his involvement on “ Queer Eye ,” which will soon premiere its tenth and final season. The show has long focused on the ongoing conversations between queer and non-queer people, and their efforts to understand one another.\n \n\n   \n  “People who we’ve met on the show who definitely leaned more on the conservative side knew us as concepts, before meeting us,” he said. “They have their ideas of what it’s like to be queer and that was it.”\n \n\n   \n  The way past that, he said, was to help them “realize that we’re someone’s kid.”\n \n\n   \n  To “get to know the person as an individual and not a concept” is “a good blanket statement for any type of intolerance or lack of embracing of diversity in our culture,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Making connections and having meaningful conversations is ultimately what Porowski comes back to, for both learning the value of tolerance and arming oneself with information for better health by having those meaningful conversations with a doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “Talk to a physician, ask the questions, that’s literally what they’re there for,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski says that while he had the “great gift of being raised around science and trusting it,” he knows there are others who weren’t and don’t.\n \n\n   \n  He urges those people “who sit on the other end of the spectrum, of not trusting it” to “just shut up and put your curiosity hat on and ask questions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ask things that you’re genuinely curious about, so that you can educate yourself,” he said. “I think we all have a responsibility to educate ourselves.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/sport/football-nfl-week-9-ravens-dolphins-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:57:00-04:00","title":"Lamar Jackson throws four TDs in dominant return from injury to lead Ravens to big win over Dolphins","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lamar Jackson made a strong return from a hamstring injury by throwing four touchdown passes in a dominant 28-6 victory over the Miami Dolphins, revitalizing the Baltimore Ravens' offense.

CNN\n \n   \n  Lamar Jackson made an emphatic return to  NFL  action on Thursday Night Football, throwing four touchdown passes to lead his Baltimore Ravens to a 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson had missed the past three Ravens games with a hamstring injury, with Baltimore struggling in his absence.\n \n\n   \n  But with the two-time NFL MVP back in the lineup, the Ravens looked much more like themselves, piling up 338 yards of offense, 229 coming in the second half.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson connected on touchdown passes to Rashod Bateman, Charlie Kolar and twice to Mark Andrews.\n \n\n   \n  And while he didn’t look as explosive when he chose to run the ball, the 28-year-old’s return seemed to open up the running game in general, with the team racking up 150 yards on the ground, including 119 for Derrick Henry on 19 carries.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awesome,” Jackson afterwards. “It’s great to be back and get a dub.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the Dolphins, coming off a big win last week against the Atlanta Falcons, who took the lead in the first quarter with a field goal before Jackson capitalized on a fumble by Tahj Washington, connecting with Andrews for their first touchdown of the game.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore extended its lead in the second quarter with Andrews’ second touchdown reception of the game, capping off an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive.\n \n\n   \n  A Miami field goal just before halftime did reduce the deficit but the Dolphins failed to make any further inroads on offense after halftime, with Baltimore adding 14 points in the third quarter to ease to victory.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt a little comfortable and our guys were ready to score,” Jackson – who finished with 204 yards on 18-of-23 passing – said. “Shoutout to the offensive line. They did great.\n \n\n   \n  “All phases, all skill positions, and our running backs, those guys were just locked in and wanted to put points on the board because we only scored twice in the first half.”\n \n\n   \n  In what was Jackson’s first action since September 28, he continued his excellent record against the Dolphins. The Florida native now has 1,405 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, one interception and a 142.9 passer rating in five starts against Miami, the highest by any single player (minimum 100 attempts) vs. a single opponent in history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   \n  His return to the field is timely for Baltimore which has now won two in a row to keep its season alive, improving to 3-5 on the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens still face an uphill battle to make it to the postseason, but with Jackson back at the helm, that journey seems a little easier.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , only four teams since the 1970 merger have made the playoffs after starting a season 1-5. But, since 1990, 21 teams have made the postseason with a 3-5 opening.\n \n\n   \n  For the Dolphins, it was another crushing defeat as they slip to 2-7 and the pressure ramps back up on head coach Mike McDaniel after their big win over Atlanta last time out.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of their games this season, the loss to the Ravens was punctuated by self-inflicted errors – Washington’s first-quarter fumble gave excellent field position to Baltimore, a false start by Larry Borom on fourth-and-1 ended a promising drive, Riley Patterson missed a close field goal and Malik Washington also fumbled in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Miami produced its best performance of the season in Week 8 against the Falcons but Thursday’s outing will do nothing to quiet the talk around McDaniel’s future.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/fondation-beyeler-chanel-culture-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00-04:00","title":"Swiss art museum appoints first-ever botanical curator, backed by Chanel Culture Fund","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Fondation Beyeler, a renowned modern and contemporary art museum in Switzerland, has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its first-ever botanical curator — a role supported by the Chanel Culture Fund.

Beyeler, home to one of western Europe’s leading modern and contemporary art collections, is turning its gaze toward a novel type of gallery — its own gardens.\n \n\n   \n  Located near Basel, Switzerland, the museum has long been a popular cultural attraction for its art as well as its scenic setting. Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect  Renzo Piano , the flat-roofed, single-story gallery in Riehen is gently nestled among centuries-old trees and mossy lily ponds, surrounded by green fields and vineyards, at the edge of Germany’s Black Forest.\n \n\n   \n  Since opening nearly 30 years ago, the Fondation Beyeler has hosted many site-specific artworks that engaged directly with its natural environment. In 1998, the late artist  Christo  wrapped 178 trees on the property in fabric, and, more recently,  Olafur Eliasson  removed part of the building’s facade to effectively bring one of the outdoor ponds into the gallery itself. The Icelandic artist used a non-toxic dye to give the water a neon glow, describing the work as a “model for a future landscape where human and non-humans can live together” more harmoniously.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the institution is announcing a groundbreaking new role. In what is believed to be the first of its kind at a major art museum, the Fondation Beyeler has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its inaugural botanical curator. Her role will focus on the preservation of the site’s flora and fauna and on developing public programming within its gardens.\n \n\n   \n  The position — officially, the Chanel botanical curator — is supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, a philanthropic arm of the French luxury house that backs innovative cultural projects and initiatives around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring explained that her mission is to strengthen the dialogue between art and nature. “Plants are enormously important for our culture,” she said in a video interview. “They sustain us…we live in a world that has been fully built by plants. We have a deep connection to them, physically, culturally and historically.”\n \n\n   \n  Museum director Sam Keller called the appointment a reflection of the institution’s ethos. “Nature is not a backdrop to our work, but a living part of it,” he said in a statement. “This role affirms our commitment to caring for the whole ecology of this place with the same depth, imagination and responsibility we bring to everything we do.”\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring’s appointment  presents a new model for arts institutions — expanding the idea of curatorial expertise beyond the white walls of a gallery and into the living landscape.\n \n\n   \n  With the symptoms of climate crisis increasingly felt by people and businesses, including those within the art world, the Fondation Beyeler is making a statement by putting ecological stewardship on par with artistic curation. Kesselring hopes it will inspire broader change or, at least, more public engagement. “We need to rewrite our understanding of our relationship with nature,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Yana Peel, the president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel, said during a video call that with no brick-and-mortar cultural institutions of its own (as is common for many luxury brands), the company has focused on contributing to others — seeking out ways to create impact on a project-by-project basis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have specifically not been sponsoring galas or parties or short-term projects,” she said, explaining that they want to focus on “transformational” work that is entirely non-transactional and not aimed at selling Chanel products. The initiative is about “wanting to have a positive impact on the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chanel did not confirm how long it would be funding Kesselring’s role at the foundation but it’s understood to be a multi-year partnership, in keeping with the fund’s wider mission to focus on longer-term projects.\n \n\n   \n  Established five years ago, the Chanel Culture Fund has invested in 50 projects across 15 countries. Chanel is working with the Power Station of Art in Shanghai to support a significant renovation of the institution’s third-floor gallery, including the addition of the first contemporary art library in China, with the capacity to house 50,000 books. In Brazil, the fund partnered with the Pinacoteca de São Paulo on a new annual residency program to support women artists. And in the US, the organization is funding the Chanel Center for Artists and Technology at CalArts in Southern California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:06:00Z","title":"Rebels Accused of Massacring Hundreds of People as Videos Emerge of Atrocities and Bodies in Sudanese City","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late October 2025, reports and evidence — including videos, satellite imagery, and survivor testimonies — have emerged of mass atrocities committed by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El Fasher, Darfur.

as videos emerge of atrocities and bodies in Sudanese city \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Vasco Cotovio, Nada Bashir, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-closing-times-election-results","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:00","title":"When polls close in Tuesday’s elections and when to expect results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Tuesday, October 31, 2025, the United States holds its first major elections under President Donald Trump’s second term, testing both his administration and Democratic opposition.

Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters on  artificial intelligence  and other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\n \n\n   \n  A US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown — $12 billion in payments for the month alone.\n \n\n   \n  Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n \n\n   \n  “However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”\n \n\n   \n  US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.\n \n\n   \n    Health care and the care economy\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at the  crux of the Congressional stalemate  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace are  expected to see their monthly premium leap  by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\n \n\n   \n  Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk of  losing access to Head Start programs , which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\n \n\n   \n  Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown to  negatively impact labor force participation  (particularly  for women ), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\n \n\n   \n    Spending\n \n\n   \n  The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n \n\n   \n  “And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.\n \n\n   \n  “At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that once it passes that “point of no return,” it will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remained  largely resilient , despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or  “K-shaped” economy . Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\n \n\n   \n    Prices and interest rates\n \n\n   \n  A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an already  choppy price environment , Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n \n\n   \n  “The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason to  continue cutting interest rates , he added.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”\n \n\n   \n    The human impact\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A lack of funding for safety net programs,  particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n \n\n   \n  “It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/business/k-shaped-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses how the U.S. economy is experiencing a 'K-shaped' bifurcation, where affluent consumers continue spending freely on premium products, while lower-income and younger consumers cut back due to financial stress.

31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Fact 1:  America’s  economy  and  stock market  keep growing, buoyed by  robust consumer spending  and  AI mega-growth .\n \n\n   \n   Fact 2:  Hiring is at a  standstill ,  inflation  is rising,  loan defaults  are abundant and Americans give this economy a  near-record-low rating .\n \n\n   \n  Confused? To understand how both of those things can be true, consider the burrito.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle on Wednesday reported miserable earnings and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter. The culprit: Young and lower-income consumers (Chipotle’s core customers) are cutting back on their spending, and they’re starting to skip the guac.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright on the company’s earnings call: “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home. And so, that consumer is under pressure. It is one of our core consumer cohorts. And so, they feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Boatwright said the company’s customer surveys showed many believed Chipotle was no longer affordable. People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.\n \n\n   \n  Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.\n \n\n   \n  Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”\n \n\n   \n  Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\n \n\n   \n  But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”\n \n\n   \n    The ‘K-shaped’ economy\n \n\n   \n  Economists call that phenomenon a “ K-shaped ” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  addressed that concept  Wednesday in a media briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earners  are accounting for a growing share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  What’s causing that divide?\n \n\n   \n  Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, which  keep appreciating  in the tight-supply market.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to a  four-year high . And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.  Wages outpaced inflation , especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\n \n\n   \n  But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/top-election-campaign-ads","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Top 10 Fall Campaign Ads of the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final weeks of the 2025 off-year election campaign, voters in key states like California, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania have been flooded with targeted political ads.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Voters in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania have been inundated with campaign ads this year, with each state hosting critical off-year elections that offer a preview of the issues and arguments both parties are grappling with ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the ads getting the most spending during the critical final weeks of the off-year campaigns.\n \n\n   \n   (Note: Ads are ranked by committee spending between September 1 and October 27. CNN limited the list below to one advertisement per committee.) \n \n\n   \n    1. ‘Threatens,’ from opponents of California Democrats’ redistricting\n \n\n   \n  The top ad of the fall campaign season comes from the leading group opposing California Democrats’ redistricting push, “No on Prop 50: Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.” Funded largely by Charles Munger Jr.,  a longtime supporter  of nonpartisan redistricting and heir of legendary investor Charles Munger, the group’s ad urges Californians to “protect your vote and democracy” and “vote No on Prop 50.” About $5 million has been spent on the ad so far, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. Opponents of the redistricting push have been splintered and  many are increasingly pessimistic  about Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n    2. ‘Texts’ from Jason Miyares, Virginia’s Republican attorney general\n \n\n   \n   Violent text messages  sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, emerged as a lightning rod in Virginia’s off- campaigns, as Republicans have leaned into sharp criticism of Jones and linked him to other Democrats. “Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?” asks one ad from incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, Jones’ Republican opponent.\n \n\n   \n    3. ‘Obama,’ from Gavin Newsom’s allied group for California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has  staked significant political capital  on his state’s redistricting fight,  called in the 44th president  to help. “California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Barack Obama says in the ad.\n \n\n   \n    4. ‘Stick it to Trump,’ from Tom Steyer, backing California Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Financier Tom Steyer, a liberal mega-donor  who ran for president in 2020  and is eyeing California’s 2026 governor race,  waded into his state’s redistricting fight  earlier this month with a $12 million ad buy.  “You want to stick it to Trump? Vote yes on Prop 50,” one of his ads says. Steyer gave a boost to Democrats’ messaging campaign while also raising his profile ahead of a potential statewide run next year.\n \n\n   \n    5. ‘Predators,’ from supporters of Mikie Sherrill, Democrat running for New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s allies are running a spot accusing GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli of “voting against legislation that would protect children and young adults in cases of domestic and sexual violence,” according to a review of his record while serving in the state assembly compiled by  the New Jersey Independent . The ad warns, “Jack Ciattarelli should never be governor of New Jersey.” Ciattarelli’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the ad.\n \n\n   \n    6. ‘Day One,’ from Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign\n \n\n   \n  One of Sherrill’s top campaign ads highlights her pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one. Energy bills have  been a top issue  for New Jersey voters this year, with spiking utility rates and soaring demand on an aging grid. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association  found  that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”\n \n\n   \n    7. ‘Same But Worse,’ from Sherrill opponents\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, too, have honed in on energy bills as a key issue in the New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli has argued Sherrill would continue policies from the outgoing administration of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy that he says contribute to the crunch. “More of the same, but worse,” Ciattarelli’s ad argues.\n \n\n   \n    8. ‘Protect Your Rights,’ from Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state supreme court vote\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 20 years since a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice lost a retention election. This fall,  three of the state’s liberal justices  are on the ballot. and Republicans are pressing for the chance to potentially flip the ideological balance of the battleground state high court. An ad from a Democratic group supporting the justices links the retention elections to abortion, saying the state Supreme Court is “our last line of defense.”\n \n\n   \n    9. ‘Speaking,’ from Abigail Spanberger, Democrat running for Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor of Virginia, has plastered voters’ screens with versions of an attack ad seizing on an unflattering moment from her rival, GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The ad splices clips of Earle-Sears declaring to a booing crowd, “I am speaking,” with criticism of Republican policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears is so far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,” the ad closes, echoing a Spanberger campaign refrain. (Earle-Sears  recently aired an ad  nodding to the “I am speaking” moment in which she says to the camera, “They pick your worst day.”)\n \n\n   \n    10. ‘Extreme Silence,’ from Spanberger opponents\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears and her Republican allies in the Virginia governor race have made transgender policies a focal point of their attack ads, criticizing Spanberger over her support for the Equality Act and pressing her for answers on youth sports and school bathrooms. An ad from one of the groups, Restoration of America PAC, claims Spanberger “is as extreme as it gets.” Spanberger has argued local school districts should decide their own youth participation policies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5531004","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Mamdani's youth support goes beyond New York.

For many, he's now a national leader \n         By Elena Moore \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's been years since Democratic voter Lea Ash felt hopeful about a politician, but that changed recently. \"He's been really the only bright spot for me this year,\" she said. \"[He] wants to listen to the people he's seeking to govern.\" The 26-year-old is referring to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York, who has centered his campaign on affordability concerns. For that reason, he easily has Ash's vote — if only   she lived in the city he was running in. Instead, she lives more than 1,200 miles away. \"I would like to believe one day there could be a Zohran Mamdani for Gulfport, Miss., but I don't think that's ever going to happen, at least not in my lifetime,\" Ash said, acknowledging her state's deep conservative roots. \"But it gives me hope that it can happen in other places across the country.\" In just a few months, Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman and Democratic Socialist, has gone from a long-shot fringe candidate to a national figure — securing an upset win in the   June primary, where voters 18-29 had the  highest turnout of any age group .  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Now, on the cusp of Election Day — where polls show him the clear frontrunner over his closest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — Mamdani is counting on that youth coalition to show up again. But his pledge to address rising costs appears to be resonating with young people far outside of the five boroughs. It's a message that many Gen Z and millennials say speaks to  their most pressing concerns  at a time when many feel hopeless about their leaders and yearn for new voices willing to break with political norms. \"When a candidate is able to speak to the concerns of the populace and validate those concerns … I think that that has a big impact, especially when it comes to young people,\" said Ruby Belle Booth, who studies young voters for the nonpartisan research organization CIRCLE. \"They really feel heard and like they're being respected,\" she added. \"I think any candidate can do that and have success. But right now it's Mamdani and maybe before that, it was [President] Trump.\" A local movement for Mamdani has gone national Despite living in ruby red Mississippi, Ash says she's always voted for Democrats. However, in recent years, she's grown frustrated and ignored by political leaders. It's a feeling exacerbated by her own economic situation. The pandemic cut her college experience short, and she struggled to find work, forcing her to move back home. Now, years later, even with a job, she's unable to afford her own place. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Giving up on that goal, she says, was a hard pill to swallow. \"When [my mom] was in her twenties, she was married, and she and my dad owned a house by this point, and I can't even afford to rent in a city in Mississippi,\" she said, adding that she's seen  housing prices increase  despite the state having one of the  highest poverty rates  in the country. \"It's a little demoralizing.\" But Ash hopes, if Mamdani wins, it'll send a message to Democrats in other cities around the country to take issues like housing affordability more seriously. A focus on the economy and breaking the status quo  Mamdani has campaigned on a slew of promises, particularly  around housing  — notably, he's vowing to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized units and build 200,000 new apartments for low and middle-income New Yorkers. Those proposals are part of his larger,  ambitious platform aimed at cutting prices , ranging from creating city-run grocery stores to making city buses and childcare free. His critics on the left say these ideas are unrealistic — even in a liberal bastion like New York City. Among conservatives, including Trump, Mamdani's views have been characterized as extreme or dangerous. Those warnings, however, don't seem to be fazing many young Americans, who appear most drawn to his message over any political label from either Democrats or the GOP. \"Mamdani is this candidate who is actively challenging the status quo in a lot of ways rather than representing it,\" said Booth. She points to  a CIRCLE survey  from this spring that found that just 16% of those under 30 believe Democracy is working for them, which Booth argues isn't indicative that these voters are thrilled by politics as usual. Although they hold vastly different ideologies, Booth argues Trump tapped into a similar anti-establishment mentality last year. Economic concerns were the top issue for those 18-29 last fall, and voters who prioritized the economy were also more likely to vote for the president,  according to a CIRCLE analysis of 2024 AP VoteCast data . \"I think that young people, we've seen, are not really thinking about politics in terms of those two parties and are evaluating it more in terms of the issues that they really care about,\" Booth said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Affordability concerns should cross party lines, argues 26-year-old Democrat Emily Wilson. Based in St. Petersburg, Fla., she's also supporting Mamdani from afar, and says she often talks politics with her colleagues at the spa where they work. \"Grocery prices and bus prices and rent prices, these are issues affecting both Democrats and Republicans,\" Wilson said. Though she acknowledges that some people could see Mamdani's candidacy as too radical outside of New York, she argues that a similar economic message could be effective when delivered by a candidate who knows the community. \"I think if a Floridian or a Texan were to talk about the same issues that Zohran [is talking about], I think he would have the same appeal,\" she said. Up north in a small town near Ann Arbor, Mich., Daisy Lupa, 25, feels similarly. As someone who has begrudgingly backed national Democrats in recent years, she says Mamdani's campaign is refreshing, and believes many of his proposals could help communities like hers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think that a lot of stuff that he is trying to push forward in New York … are things that we need even more in rural areas and even more in the Midwest because we don't have it at all,\" she said. \"It's flawed in New York,\" she added. \"It's absent here.\" Cautious optimism Of course, a central question for those who actually can vote in the New York mayor's race is whether Mamdani can truly solve the affordability crisis. For Dillon Robertson, 32, money is a constant worry. He commutes to college in Connecticut and will graduate with close to $250,000 in student loans. He's supporting Mamdani and says many of his cost-saving proposals could make his life easier, but at the same time, he worries if it's all possible. \"A lot of the stuff he says sounds nice. But I both wonder, can he do it? Can he pull it off?\" he said. \"Or [is] it just kind of like a Band-Aid on a leaky ship?\" Still, he admits, if the options are to keep plodding along or try something new, he's ready to give it a shot. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5588904","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Leans Into Crackdown on City Crime, GOP Sees It as a Winning Issue","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has escalated a national campaign to combat urban crime by deploying federal National Guard troops to multiple U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, and Portland.

The GOP sees it as a winning issue \n         By Franco Ordoñez \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump threatened to deploy more troops to U.S. cities this week — and not just the National Guard — as part of what he describes as his national crackdown on crime. Speaking to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump said he planned to expand his crime and immigration offensive because \"we have cities in trouble.\" \"We're sending in our National Guard, and if we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard, because we're going to have safe cities,\" Trump said, aboard the USS George Washington at the Yokosuka Naval Base. \"We're not going to have people killed in our cities. And whether people like that or not, that's what we're doing.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The White House has transformed what started as a focused effort, purportedly meant to address crime in Washington, D.C. into a nationwide campaign to portray Trump and the Republicans as unabashed crime fighters while painting Democrats as coddlers of crime. Violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low prior to the Guard's arrival. Trump has also deployed troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Tenn., and Portland, Ore, which has triggered protests and lawsuits. Democratic leaders have accused the White House of exaggerating the challenges in order to launch an illegal military occupation. But Trump is banking on the moves helping him and Republicans in next year's midterms. At a cabinet meeting in August, Trump called crime a stronger issue for Republicans to run on than transgender athletes in school sports and possibly even immigration. \"Crime is probably the issue that he fares best on, certainly better than handling inflation or trade or even international relations, despite some of the successes that he's had recently,\" said Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research. Political data points to a clear opportunity for Trump and the Republicans. Though FBI data show that violent crime decreased by 4.5 percent last year, a  new Gallup poll released Thursday shows  almost half of Americans — 49 percent — feel that crime has risen from last year — while about a third — or 33 percent — feel crime has gone down. The Gallup poll also reveals some political risks for Trump. More Americans oppose using federal troops to combat domestic crime than support the move — but the divide is largely along political lines, as Republicans overwhelmingly support the use of troops while Democrats are opposed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Crime shouldn't be looked at through a partisan lens, but Trump has tapped into one of the most basic quality of life issues, said Jillian Snider, a member of the Council on Criminal Justice and retired New York police officer. She said most people do not look online to see if crime is up or down. They instead walk down the street. \"That is the real problem here, that general community members, they don't care as much to be schooled by what the stats show us,\" said Snider, who also teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"They just care about how they feel in their communities.\" Republicans have long leaned into law and order, but veteran political strategist Alex Conant says Trump embraces the issue in an unprecedented way when you look at troops in cities. \"He told his base he was going to get crime in American cities under control. And now, when you turn on the TV at night, U.S. troops are trying to do exactly that,\" Conant said. \"Now, obviously, there's going to be a lot of opposition to it, especially amongst Democrats, people who live in some of those neighborhoods. But this is what he told his base he would do, and now he's delivering it. And, he's proud of it.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   President Trump threatened this past week to deploy more troops throughout the country as part of what he describes as a crackdown on crime. He spoke to US troops in Japan and argued he has to do this to save American cities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're sending in our National Guard, and if we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard because we're going to have safe cities. We're not going to have people killed in our cities. And whether people like that or not, that's what we're doing. PFEIFFER: Some previous deployments to Democratic-led cities have spurred protests and lawsuits, but Trump is betting these moves will help him and Republicans, especially in next year's midterms. NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez looks into why. FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: President Trump made a rare visit this summer to the White House briefing room to announce he was deploying hundreds of national guard troops to Washington, D.C. And he told a story about growing up in New York City and going out to eat with his late father, Fred Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: He used to say, son, when you walk into a restaurant and you see a dirty front door, don't go in, because if the front door is dirty, the kitchen's dirty also. ORDOÑEZ: Ignoring the fact that violent crime in Washington, D.C., is at a 30-year low, Trump promised to crack down on the, quote, \"bloodthirsty criminals,\" clean up trash and clear out the homelessness. He appeared to be evangelizing the widely criticized broken windows theory, which contends that failing to address smaller problems like smashed windows leads to bigger problems and more serious crimes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Same thing with the Capitol. If our capital's dirty, our whole country is dirty. ORDOÑEZ: But what started out as a focused effort in Washington, D.C., has since transformed into a nationwide campaign to present Trump and the Republicans as unabashed crime fighters, while painting Democrats as coddlers of crime. Trump has now deployed troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon. Democrats have cried foul. Leaders have accused the White House of launching an illegal military occupation. Meanwhile, Trump says Democrats have fallen into a political trap that will only pay off for Republicans in next year's midterm elections. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: But I would say that crime is stronger than men playing in women's sports. I think it's stronger than transgender for everybody. You know, transgender for everybody, according to them - it's stronger. Of course, it's - this is the cause of it - open borders. ORDOÑEZ: Jillian Snider of the Council on Criminal Justice and a retired New York police officer says Trump has tapped into one of the most basic quality-of-life issues. Crime shouldn't be looked at through partisan lines, she says. If people don't feel safe, they don't feel safe, no matter what anyone tells them. JILLIAN SNIDER: That is the real problem here, that general community members - they don't care as much to be schooled by what the stats show us. They just care about how they feel in their communities (ph). ORDOÑEZ: And the political data points to a clear opportunity for Trump and the Republicans. A new Gallup poll released this week shows almost half of Americans - 49% - feel that crime has risen from last year, while about a third - or 33% - feel crime has gone down. The FBI says actual violent crime has decreased by 4.5% last year. The Gallup poll also cites some risks for Trump. More Americans oppose using federal troops to combat domestic crime, but the divide is largely along political lines, as Republicans overwhelmingly support the use of troops while Democrats are opposed. ALEX CONANT: Trump views cracking down on crime as a huge political winner, and historically, he's right. ORDOÑEZ: Veteran political strategist Alex Conant says Republicans have long leaned into law and order. But Trump embraces it in an unprecedented way, when you look at troops in cities. CONANT: But it's hard to argue that it's not a political winner form with independents, suburban voters and his base, you know, the very people that elected him. ORDOÑEZ: And he says, while Democrats don't want to condone Trump's policies, they need to be careful how they condemn the actions, especially if they lead to voters feeling safer.

PALM BEACH, Fla. — The U.S. military has carried out another lethal strike on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday. Hegseth in a social media posting said the vessel was operated by a U.S.-designated terrorist organization but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September. \"This vessel—like EVERY OTHER—was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said in a posting on X. The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes. Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. U.S. lawmakers have been repeatedly rebuffed by the White House in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hegseth in his Saturday posting announcing the latest strike said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\" Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth. \"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote. Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz. The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\" Earlier Friday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released a pair of letters sent to Hegseth written in late September and early October requesting the department's legal rationale for the strikes and the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594186","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-04:00","title":"Daylight saving time ends Sunday.

Here's what to know \n         By Chandelis Duster \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 9:26 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's that time of year again: Many Americans will have to reset their clocks and circadian rhythms when daylight saving time ends on Sunday. That means, in most states, lighter mornings and darker evenings. At 2:00 a.m. on Sunday, the time for millions across the country will jump back one hour – an adjustment that has been both welcomed by those seeking extra sleep time or criticized by those who see it as an inconvenience. Here is what you should know. How many states observe daylight saving time? Every U.S. state observes daylight saving time except for Hawaii and Arizona,  according to the National Conference of State Legislatures  (NCSL). The portion of the Navajo Nation that's in Arizona, however, does observe daylight saving. U.S. territories Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands also don't change their clocks. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many more want to. Nineteen states have enacted legislation that would create daylight saving time for its residents year-round, the NCSL said. \"Because federal law does not currently allow full-time DST, Congress would have to act before states could adopt changes,\" according to the NCSL. Many Americans want daylight saving time all year Only 12% of adults in the U.S. are in favor of the current daylight saving time system, while 47% oppose it, according to an  AP-NORC poll  released on Thursday. And 56% of adults polled said they prefer permanent daylight saving time with less light in the morning and more light in the evening, according to the poll. Forty-two percent said they prefer permanent standard time, with more light in the morning and less light in the evening. Making daylight saving time permanent has failed again President Trump has urged Congress to pass legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent — which, if enacted, would put an end to the debate over whether to change the time in the U.S. twice a year. Both the House and Senate should \"push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day,\" the president  wrote  in April on Truth Social. But an attempt to stop the time adjustment has once again stalled in Congress. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Sunshine Protection Act, sponsored by Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida with bipartisan support, would make daylight saving time the permanent, standard time. Earlier this week, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas objected to Scott's request to advance the measure using unanimous consent, that a permanent daylight saving time would make winter \"a dark and dismal time for millions of Americans.\" \"By moving the clock back an hour in winter, permanent daylight savings time would push winter sunrises to an absurdly late hour, depriving Americans of morning sunshine that is essential for our safety and well-being,\" Cotton said Tuesday on the Senate floor.

Tuesday. Here are 5 questions about what the results might mean \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Off-year elections are often a referendum on the president and his party. And this year, of course, that means President Trump and Republicans. Trump is unpopular, particularly with independents, who will be key in swing districts in next year's midterm elections. So the narratives and the margins coming out of the Nov. 4 elections will matter — and offer some clues as to how the landscape for 2026 begins to take shape. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here are five questions to consider when thinking about Tuesday's elections: 1. How much of a drag is Trump? Republicans lost 40 House seats during Trump's first midterm in 2018. Just before that election, Trump's approval rating, according to Gallup, was  40 %. Now, it's an almost identical  41 %. Democrats have certainly been trying to use Trump a lot in the 2025 elections, mentioning him often in ads, and trying to tie their Republican opponents to him. Republican candidates in these elections have largely steered clear of the president. Partially, that's because the most closely watched elections Tuesday are taking place in states that lean left — governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the fight over a ballot initiative in California. But these elections have a history of moving in the direction of the party opposite of the president's. That's because they're among the first chances for voters aligned with the party out of power to register their frustration. It's why, for example, the governor's race in Virginia has gone to the opposition party in 11 of the last 12, dating back to 1977. (The exception was Democrat Terry McAuliffe during Obama's presidency.) It's a necessary, perennial caveat that too much shouldn't be made out of off-year elections and what they mean for midterms, but Tuesday's elections will be the first major electoral sign of the political mood in the county — and what voters think of the president. 2. Will Democrats have a chance at counterbalancing Republican redistricting efforts?  Maybe the most important election Tuesday is one in California when  voters decide on Proposition 50. The state is currently mandated to redraw congressional districts by an independent commission. But voting in favor of Prop 50 Tuesday would temporarily overturn that requirement and give Democrats the chance to try and offset gains Trump is trying to make in redrawing  in red states like Texas . This will also be an early test of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a likely 2028 presidential candidate. The \"No\" campaign has run ads urging people to stop Newsom's \"power grab.\" Newsom himself has run ads for the \"Yes\" campaign and opponents have pulled back the millions they had been promising to spend. A sign of the direction this is headed Tuesday? 3. Are Latinos shifting away from Republicans? Trump made inroads with Latinos in the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he did better with Latinos than any Republican in history, according to exit polls. But there have been signs in polling during this second Trump term that they are slipping from the president and the GOP. That's come amid Trump's mass deportations that have rounded up far more than the hardened criminals Trump's administration promised — and Trump's lack of focus on getting prices down, a key reason many switched sides to vote for Trump. One place to watch as an indicator is New Jersey. Though Trump lost the state in 2024, he made significant improvements, particularly in counties with heavy Latino populations. For those playing at home, the counties to watch here include Passaic (45% Latino, per the Census), Hudson (41%), Cumberland (36%) and Union (35%). Trump improved in all of them from his 2020 national loss to 2024 win. He was the first Republican to win Passaic since 1992. He won it by about 3 points after losing it by 16 points four years earlier and 22 points in 2016. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       4. What messaging lessons do Democrats take out of Tuesday?  There are very different candidates running in these elections. And they are likely to serve as different examples over the next year of how to run — or not — as a Democrat. For New York mayor, for example,  Zohran Mamdani has captured  the imaginations of progressives with his focus on affordability. But he's also become a lightning rod on the right for his criticisms of Israel and past tweets calling for defunding the police. He has since disavowed the idea of defunding the police and says safety is a top priority. How he does Tuesday — and, more importantly, how he governs, if he wins — could indicate whether Democrats nationally run with his message and style, or if they prefer the more reserved approach of their gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. Abigail  Spanberger in Virginia  is running on \"tradition\" and \"service,\" and Mikie  Sherrill in New Jersey  stresses her military credentials. But the truth is Democrats are in the wilderness, and there's no perfect way to run. First of all, candidates have to be authentic, true to themselves. Few will be able to replicate Mamdani's knack for using social media. And Mamdani can't invent being a CIA officer (Spanberger) or Navy helicopter pilot (Sherrill). What his campaign has exposed most is that a focus on affordability with a clear message and a lack of condescension toward a younger generation has been key for winning over younger progressives. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Of course, not everywhere is New York and progressives aren't a majority of voters. That's something Democrats, in particular, have to balance as the party has traditionally had a wider range of views and identities. 5. What will the elections mean for the shutdown?  The country is careening toward the longest government shutdown in American history. There is no real end in sight, but Tuesday's results may have an impact. Health care has been a major reason for this shutdown. Democrats want to extend subsidies before they expire at the end of the year so tens of millions of people don't see their premiums go way up. Republicans are refusing to negotiate until the government is reopened, but Democrats are skeptical they would negotiate in good faith at all. During the  longest shutdown in history in 2019 , polling clearly showed a majority blaming Trump for the shutdown. That put pressure on Trump to come to the table. But this time around, even though Republicans are getting  more of the blame , it's not as overwhelming as six years ago. And that has the two sides in a stalemate. Tuesday could shake that up, especially if there are definitive results in one direction or the other. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591497","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"14:43:00Z","title":"As SNAP benefits run dry, 'grocery buddies' are footing their neighbors' food bills","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — commonly known as food stamps — runs dry due to a government shutdown, nearly 42 million Americans face the threat of going hungry.

are footing their neighbors' food bills \n         By Juliana Kim \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 2:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         For Alicia Spradley, it all started with a quick prayer. Spradley from Chicago had seen the news that federal food aid was pausing at the start of November due to the government shutdown. With local food banks  already stretched thin , she worried that her neighbors might soon go hungry. So, on Monday night, she closed her eyes and asked, \"What can I do to help?\" A few hours later, she came across a post on a Facebook community group about becoming a \"grocery buddy\" — someone who buys groceries for a stranger or anyone at risk of losing their food benefits. Without hesitation, Spradley wrote her own callout, offering support. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said funding has run dry for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — better known as SNAP or food stamps — past October. For nearly 42 million Americans who rely on the assistance, that means their debit-like EBT cards are at risk of not being refilled this month. Some states have committed funding to help fill the gap, but it's unclear how long the support can last. On Friday,  a federal judge ruled  that the USDA must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going and ordered an update by Monday. It remains unclear how the Trump administration will respond. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to the limbo, there has been a wave of people nationwide on social media participating in an informal grocery buddy system until benefits are restored. Some \"buddies\" are sending gift cards, while others are shopping and dropping off groceries. In her neighborhood of Rogers Park, Spradley said more than two dozen people replied to her offer — some asking for help themselves, others pointing to friends or neighbors who need the support. \"I did not think that in just a short period of time that we would get that much interest,\" said Spradley, who also runs Plate & Pathways, a small nonprofit that works to combat food insecurity. SNAP is the largest anti-hunger program in the country. Most of its recipients are seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. Similarly, Spradley said many of the people who asked for her help were elderly or working families who struggled to find the time to visit a local food pantry. \"I'm glad that people have the courage to reach out and ask for help,\" she said. Hannah Coburn, a night-shift nurse in Spokane, Wash., felt the same way when she posted a callout on her private Facebook account. At first, most of the replies were from friends cheering on the idea. Then, a message popped up in her inbox: It was from an acquaintance she had met a few times at roller derby events. \"She said that it was really hard for her to reach out,\" Coburn said. \"It didn't even occur to me that she would be someone who would lose that.\" According to Coburn, the acquaintance said she had some money set aside for groceries but ended up using the funds for unexpected car repairs. Coburn's takeaway is that anyone could be relying on SNAP benefits and sometimes, the only way to find out who needs help is to offer it first. \" I hope that more people see that and get an idea of like, 'Oh, I could do something and maybe it could be helping somebody that I actually know,' \" she said. Others say they were motivated to step in because they had experienced financial hardship firsthand. Karie Fugett, an author from Dothan, Ala., said she grew up on food stamps and, later in life, faced periods of living in her car and not knowing where her next meal would come from. \"I am lucky right now to be able to afford groceries, afford my rent, all of that, but I haven't forgotten that in the past that wasn't the case and that people helped me,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Fugett is currently supporting two families on SNAP, totaling over $1,000. To do so, she said she plans to tap into funds that she saved to build her future house. \"I'll just figure out how to get that money back later,\" she said. \"I don't need it in this moment and other people need things in this moment, so that's a priority to me.\" Fugett also expressed frustration that families are at risk of going hungry as a result of lawmakers unable to reach an agreement to end the government shutdown. \"It's especially upsetting that it's because the people that we voted into office are not doing their job,\" she said. While grocery buddies offer immediate help, SNAP changes could cause long-term woes In North Carolina's Outer Banks, Micah Iverson, a project manager and musician, said he recently dropped off groceries for a single mother of four children in his community. The experience gave him a new perspective. \"I've never bought baby diapers before,\" he said. \"They're very expensive, in case you didn't know.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Iverson paid for the woman's groceries using a $300 gift card that he won at a trivia game. The night that he went to unload the bags into the woman's car, Iverson said they both were holding back tears. \" She kind of stopped me at the end and was like, 'I really didn't know what I was gonna do, so thank you,'\" he said. Although his gift card only lasted for one grocery trip, Iverson said he plans to check in and help out with groceries in a few weeks if SNAP remains stalled. \" We'll do this just until something changes,\" he said. The lapse in federal food and nutrition assistance isn't necessarily short-lived. Since the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July , SNAP has faced budget cuts and stricter eligibility rules. Starting this month, states must comply with new work requirements to qualify for the aid — a change that could leave  2.4 million people without benefits . Spradley in Chicago has been grappling with how to be a grocery buddy long-term. \" We're trying to figure this out as a community to make sure that we are not leaving anybody out and we are just coming up with things as we go,\" she said. Earlier this week, Spradley said she met with a mother who was panicking over how to feed her seven children this month. She handed the woman some cash — pooled from her wallet and donations — and what happened next surprised her. \" She's like, 'Anything that you know I can do to help you guys, let me know,'\" she said. \"And it just moves me because here is this person in need and they are still trying to be of service to the community.\" \n         \n         Correction \n         Nov. 1st, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misidentified Micah Iverson's job title. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5593446","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"The time change is a chance to reset your sleep schedule – especially for teens","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The switch from daylight saving time to standard time on November 2, 2025, presents a valuable opportunity for teens to adjust their sleep schedules by exposing themselves to more morning light, which helps reset their internal circadian clocks.

\n        \n        \n      \n\n         The switch from daylight saving to standard time offers a reprieve for those who need more sleep. Clocks fell back an hour on Sunday morning and many people may have enjoyed an extra hour of slumber. Going forward, this change means darker evenings and brighter mornings — and you can take advantage of that morning light to reset your sleep schedule. This can be especially helpful for teenagers who get chronically little sleep. Three out of four high school students don't get enough shut-eye,  according  to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dragging groggy teens out of bed in the morning, or forcing them off their screens and into bed at night can be frustrating for parents. Sleep doctors say a little better understanding of the adolescent biology of bedtime can help your teen sleep more. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sleep drive and circadian clocks More than other age groups, teens have to fight to stay on a schedule that doesn't match their biology. One reason is our internal 24-hour clock, the circadian clock, which you can think of \"as the conductor of an orchestra of many clocks throughout the body,\" says  Stephanie Crowley , a chronobiologist at Rush University in Chicago.. At the start of puberty, this orchestra of clocks decides — hey, I want to stay up reeeeally late. This changes again around our late 20s but for teens it means they often just don't feel sleepy as early. Then there's the homeostatic sleep drive, which is the other major biological mechanism that regulates sleep. It doesn't do teens any favors either. The sleep drive tracks how long you've been awake and tells your body when to shut down. But this physiological process slows down in teens, so they get tired more slowly, explains Crowley. \"You can think about it as a pressure cooker,\" she says. \"So that pressure for sleep to begin just kind of grows much more slowly in the more mature adolescent.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       School schedules and pressures Even experts in sleep medicine struggle with this aspect of parenting, says  Dr. Sanjay Patel , a sleep medicine physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and father to 15-year-old twins. Patel says he and his wife do the best they can to help their daughters get quality rest. For example, the high school sophomores don't have their phones in their bedrooms at night, nor are they allowed to sleep past 8:00 am on weekends since this can throw off their weekday schedule. \"I think that parents and teens need to just be involved in trying to point out how this is affecting them day to day, because otherwise it's just nothing changes,\" he says. But there's nothing Patel can do about his daughters' school day starting at 7:28 am, a time that doesn't align with their biology. School start times are a big problem, but after school demands on teens also steal their sleep, says  Mary Carskadon , a sleep researcher at Brown University. Teens' schedules are packed with extracurriculars, parttime jobs, and homework. Carskadon says all of this contributes to pervasive sleep deprivation. It's why she gets annoyed when people disparage teens for moodiness or poor impulse control since these behaviors are hallmarks of poor sleep. \"I mean, they're really blaming the victim,\" she says. For teens to get better rest, Carskadon advocates for the schools to start later and give less homework. And she says extracuriculars shouldn't be allowed to drag far into the evening. \"We have to think full circle,\" says Carskadon, noting that public health issues like the teen  suicide rate  and  car accidents  might be mitigated if adolescents had better rest. Another systemic change Carskadon, Crowley, and Patel want is an end to daylight saving time and to remain on standard time throughout the year. This would increase exposure to morning light, which is a critical environmental cue that it's time to wake up, and could help teens adapt their circadian clocks to an earlier schedule. Sleep strategies to try at home Sleep doctors recommend several strategies parents can use to help teens. For one, remind teens that quality rest allows them to excel in athletics or academics, says  Dr. Rafael Pelayo , who works with adolescents at Stanford Medicine's Sleep Medicine Center. He also recommends letting them do something they enjoy when they first wake up. For example, if a kid's a gamer, then power up the Xbox at 7:00 am, and, he says, tell them: \"The earlier you wake up, the more time you can play the video game. And then you get light into your eyes.\" Don't send kids to their bedrooms as a punishment, Pelayo says, because that creates a negative association with the area where they sleep. And parents should model healthy sleep behaviors for their teens, which includes no late-night snacking or doom scrolling. On the weekends, many teens catch up on missed rest by sleeping in hours past their weekday alarm. Crowley says that this causes a sort of jet lag as it shifts a teen's internal clock by 45 or 50 minutes in just two days. An hour or so of extra rest is fine, but Crowley agrees with Patel that it's best to get up at about the same time every day — even Saturdays. And Crowley's research has found that, unfortunately, long naps can exacerbate the problem because it weakens the homeostatic sleep drive by causing teens to feel tired even later. Crowley recommends capping naps at 30 minutes. A big challenge a lot of teens face is they just don't feel tired at night, though Crowley says the recent change to standard time is a chance to transition into a better schedule. Say you usually go to bed at midnight. Maybe tonight, turn off the lights at 11 p.m. It will probably still feel like midnight to your body, but you'll wake up with an extra hour of rest. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594773","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"03:55:00Z","title":"Smith's homer in 11th lifts Dodgers over Blue Jays 5-4 to become first repeat champion in 25 years","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a historic and emotionally charged Game 7 of the 2025 World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in an 11-inning thriller, marking their first repeat championship in 25 years and the first repeat title in the National League since the 1975–1976 Cincinnati Reds.

to become first repeat champion in 25 years \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 3:55 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         TORONTO — In a World Series for the ages that went back and forth again and again, Will Smith delivered the biggest swing of all for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Smith connected in the 11th for the first extra-inning homer in a winner-take-all title game, and Miguel Rojas became the first player to hit a tying home run in the ninth inning of a Game 7. On a roller-coaster night of see-sawing emotions, the Dodgers outlasted the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 Saturday to become the first repeat champion in a quarter century. \"You dream of those moments,\" Smith said after the 4-hour, 7-minute thriller. \"I'll remember that for forever.\" In the type of dramatic Game 7 that kids conjure in backyards, the Blue Jays led 3-0 on Bo Bichette's third-inning homer off Shohei Ohtani and 4-2 before Max Muncy's eighth-inning solo homer off star rookie Trey Yesavage. Toronto was two outs from its first championship since 1993 when Rojas, inserted into the slumping Dodgers lineup in Game 6 to provide some energy, homered on a full-count slider from Jeff Hoffman and stunned the Rogers Centre crowd of 44,713. \"I've cost everybody in here a World Series ring,\" Hoffman said. Rojas hadn't homered since Sept. 19. \"I had a conversation with my wife,\" he said. \"She told me something big was waiting for me.\" World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto escaped a bases-loaded jam in the bottom half, and Toronto reliever Seranthony Domínguez stranded three Dodgers runners in the 10th. Smith, who hit a go-ahead homer in Game 2, sent a 2-0 pitch from Shane Bieber into Toronto's bullpen in left field, where it bounced into the seats and gave the Dodgers their first lead of the night. Running between first and second, Smith raised his arms in triumph. \"He hung a slider,\" Smith said. \"I banged it.\" Bieber, the 2020 AL Cy Young Award winner, was making his first relief appearance since 2019. \"He was looking for it and I didn't execute,\" he said. Of course, there had to be even more drama in just the sixth winner-take-all Series game to go extra innings. It matched the Marlins' 3-2 win over Cleveland in 1997 as the second-longest Game 7, behind only the Washington Senators' 4-3, 12-inning victory against the New York Giants in 1924. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. doubled leading off the bottom of the 11th and was sacrificed to third. Addison Barger walked and Alejandro Kirk hit a broken-bat grounder to shortstop Mookie Betts, who started a title-winning 6-6-3 double play. It was only the second double play to end a Series, after the Yankees turned one in 1947 against the Dodgers. \"I thought we had chances to sweep them,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \"Going back to the beginning of the Series when people were calling it David vs. Goliath, it's not even close.\" Smith set a Series record by catching 73 innings. Betts earned his fourth title in the finale of baseball's 150th major league season, the first that began and ended outside the United States. In the Dodgers bullpen for the last game of his decorated 18-year career, Clayton Kershaw lost track of the outs. \"When he hit the double play, I thought the run scored and it was tied,\" he said. \"I thought I had the next batter.\" Los Angeles and its $500 million roster overcame a 3-2 Series deficit on the road. The Dodgers became the first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees won three in a row, and the first from the National League since the 1975 and '76 Cincinnati Reds. With their ninth championship and third in six years, the Dodgers made an argument for their 2020s teams to be considered a dynasty. Dave Roberts, their manager since 2016, boosted the probability he will gain induction to the Hall of Fame. \"To do what we've done in this span of time is pretty remarkable,\" Roberts said. \"I guess let the pundits and all the fans talk about if it's a dynasty or not.\" After throwing 96 pitches in a Game 6 win Friday, Yamamoto tossed 43 more over 2 2/3 innings for his third win of the Series. He finished the postseason 5-1 with a 1.45 ERA. \"Before I went in, to be honest, I was not really sure if I could pitch up there to my best ability,\" Yamamoto said through a translator. \"But as I started getting warmed up ... I started making a little bit of an adjustment, and then I started thinking I can go in and do my job.\" This Series produced the World Series' first pinch-hit grand slam, its first complete game in a decade, an 18-inning Game 3 featuring Shohei Ohtani reaching base nine times, six outs on the bases and Freddie Freeman becoming the first to hit two walk-off homers, the first back-to-back homers opening a game, Yesavage striking out a rookie-record 12 just six weeks after his debut, and the first game-ending double play in which an outfielder had a putout or assist. \"That game had every single thing you could possibly have,\" Freeman said. \"Just an absolutely incredible game, incredible Series.\" Los Angeles used all four of its postseason starting pitchers, with Yamamoto joined by Ohtani and Glasnow (2 1/3 innings each) and Blake Snell (1 1/3 innings). Bichette, eyes bulging, put Toronto ahead in the third with a 442-foot drive off Ohtani, the two-way star pitching on three days' rest after taking the loss in Game 4. Los Angeles closed to 3-2 on sacrifice flies from Teoscar Hernández in the fourth off 41-year-old Max Scherzer, just the fourth pitcher to start multiple winner-take-all Game 7s, and Tommy Edman in the sixth against Chris Bassitt. Andrés Giménez restored Toronto's two-run lead with an RBI double in the sixth off Glasnow, who relieved after getting the final three outs on three pitches to save Game 6 on Friday. There was so much more to come. In a Series filled with key defensive plays, Rojas stumbled in the ninth while fielding Daulton Varsho's one-out, bases-loaded grounder off Yamamoto. Rojas managed to throw home for a forceout as Smith kept his foot on the plate to beat Isiah Kiner-Falefa, who had taken an unusually short 7.8-foot lead off third. Ernie Clement then flied out to center fielder Andy Pages, who had just come off the bench for defense. Pages sprinted 121 feet and made a jumping, backhand catch on the left-center warning track as he crashed into left fielder Kiké Hernández. Then with the bases loaded and one out in the 10th, Pages grounded to shortstop, where Giménez threw home for a forceout. Guerrero fielded a grounder to the right side and tossed to Domínguez covering first, just beating Hernández in a call upheld upon video review. Visiting teams have won five straight World Series Game 7s after home teams won nine in a row from 1982 to 2011. While the Dodgers were sprayed with silver confetti and they celebrated, the Blue Jays pondered how close they came in falling short. Eyes were red and voices cracked amid the sobbing. \"I've been crying for like probably for an hour,\" Clement said long after the final out. \"I thought I was done with the tears.\" In the midst of the celebration, Freeman already looked ahead to the big, bad Dodgers taking on the rest of baseball again in 2026. \"The Yankees are three-time back-to-back,\" he said, \"so we get to use that same narrative next year.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594754","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-05:00","title":"UK police detain 2 suspects after train stabbings leave 9 people with life-threatening injuries","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mass stabbing attack occurred on a London-bound train traveling from Doncaster to King's Cross station, which stopped in Huntingdon, eastern England, on Saturday.

         Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 1:57 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LONDON — Ten people remained in hospital on Sunday, nine of them with life-threatening injuries, after a  mass stabbing attack  spread fear and chaos on a London-bound train in eastern England, British police said. Two suspects were in custody and police said they were working to find a motive. Details of the attack were sketchy. Bloodied passengers spilled out of the long-distance train when it made an emergency stop on Saturday in the town of Huntingdon, where dozens of police waited, soon after multiple stabbings were reported onboard. Two people were arrested by armed officers at the station. Police have not identified the suspects or disclosed a motive, but said counterterror police are supporting the investigation. Defense Secretary John Healey told Sky News that \"the early assessment is that this was an isolated incident, an isolated attack.\" British Transport Police said in a statement that \"10 people have been taken to hospital with nine believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries. \"This has been declared a major incident and Counter Terrorism Policing are supporting our investigation whilst we work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident,\" it added, The police force said that \"Plato,\" the national code word used by police and emergency services when responding to what could be a \"marauding terror attack,\" was initiated. That declaration was later rescinded but no motive for the attack was disclosed. \"We're conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,\" Chief Superintendent Chris Casey said. \"At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.\" The attack took place as the train from Doncaster in northern England to London's King's Cross station was about halfway through its 2-hour journey and approaching Huntingdon, a market town a few miles northwest of the university city of Cambridge. Passenger Olly Foster told the BBC he heard people shouting \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone,\" and initially thought it might have been a Halloween prank. But as passengers pushed past him to get away, he noticed his hand was covered in blood from a chair he had leaned on. Emergency services, including armed police and air ambulances, responded quickly as the train drew into Huntingdon. The attack appears to have been contained swiftly after the train arrived at the station, and police officers wearing forensic suits, with a police dog, could be seen on the platform. Cambridgeshire Constabulary, the local police force, said officers were called at 7:39 p.m. on Saturday to the scene, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of London. Police were at the station within minutes. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his \"thoughts are with all those affected\" after the \"appalling incident.\" Paul Bristow, the mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, said he had heard of \"horrendous scenes\" on the train. London North Eastern Railway, or LNER, which operates the East Coast Mainline services in the U.K., confirmed the incident had happened on one of its trains and said there would be major disruption on the route until Monday. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5535648","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Declining Population Will Make It Even Harder to Care for Elders","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing crisis in elder care in the United States, driven by longer lifespans and fewer children, which makes it increasingly difficult for families to care for aging relatives.

     The declining population will make it even harder to care for elders \n         By Kristin Wright, Marisa Peñaloza \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON, D.C. — Maurice White, 75, and Renee DeVigne, 68, are among the millions of family caregivers in the U.S. whose lives center around caring for aging loved ones. The Washington, D.C. couple has gone to extraordinary lengths, into their own retirement years, to take care of family elders. They've cared for White's mother Evelyn White in their home for 25 years. The retired teacher turned 104 in October. She's one of the last of their elders they will care for. \"There have been 12,\" said DeVigne. \"His father, my mother, and other aunts, uncles, grandparents.\" The couple also helps care for DeVigne's dad, who lives in a memory care facility. While people are living longer, they're also having fewer children,  according to the United Nations . In the U.S., this population shift means caring for parents, grandparents, and other relatives could become even more challenging with fewer family members to pitch in. The caregiving industry is already experiencing a workforce shortage. The   decline in the birth rate  may reshape how we think about caring for the oldest Americans. Multigenerational living Maurice White and DeVigne say they know many families can't keep loved ones at home for various reasons. Some are juggling the demands of jobs and parenthood. White retired early — 20 years ago — and the couple doesn't have children. Some families may not have enough space in their homes. White built an apartment in their basement for his mother. He says their culture as a Black family plays an important role in their decision to provide care at home. \"I do think that African-American families have more of a tendency to do that, many because of money, but more just because of the family connection,\" he said. \"This is my mom. We put her to bed every night and say prayers with her.\" According to  Pew Research Center , about 26% of Black and Hispanic Americans, and 24% of Asian Americans lived in multigenerational households compared to 13% of white Americans in 2021. And the  Bureau of Labor Statistics  says from 2021-2022, 45% of Black elder care providers were taking care of a parent. For Hispanics or Latinos, that same figure was about half. Ai-jen Poo is Executive Director of Caring Across Generations and President of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. She says the U.S. is nearing a tipping point with families overwhelmed by caregiving demands. \"We've kind of taken this model of care where you're on your own and you're expected to shoulder and manage it as an individual or as families alone,\" she said. \"We've taken this model to its very limit and we're all at the edge of the cliff looking down and wondering what to do next.\" White and DeVigne took care of his mother Evelyn without assistance until she started needing more support a couple of years ago. Then, they hired home health aide Selisa Sutton. \"I'm like family. I call her my auntie,\" said Sutton, 52. Evelyn was out for mile-long walks. \"She was bathing herself, brushing her teeth, getting herself dressed, she'd ride her bike, we'd go to the senior citizen center everyday!\" But this summer, everything changed. Evelyn had a stroke. She was in the hospital for nine days and then started short-term rehab at Knollwood Life Plan Community, a senior living community in Washington, D.C. Workforce shortages and rising cost of care Knollwood is among many care facilities that have had to navigate the strain of workforce shortages. Beverly Morgan, a registered nurse and director of Sales and Marketing at the center says she's concerned about these shortages because it's projected to grow worse nationally. \"The shortage was an issue 10 years before the pandemic. Then, you had this horrific pandemic that took a large portion of people out of the system,\" she said. The Trump Administration's immigration policies are also expected to   deepen the strain .   Immigrants make up  more than a fourth of professional direct long-term care workers. The median cost of a home health aide for 40 hours a week was more than $68,000 a year in 2023, according to  KFF , an independent health policy research, polling and news organization headquartered in the D.C. area. The median annual price tag for a private bedroom in assisted living exceeded $64,000. Assisted living support at Knollwood starts at about $89,000 a year. Families typically must pay out-of-pocket or use long-term care insurance for both types of care. Congress has made cuts to Medicaid, as more than 700,000 aging adults, people with disabilities, and those with chronic conditions are   on waitlists  to receive Medicaid home and community-based care in dozens of states. \"If we're living an average of 20 years longer … we've got to re-imagine a system of care and a culture of caregiving,\" said Poo. Human connection is key  Maurice White and Renee DeVigne's advice for people who want to care for loved ones at home is to learn as much as possible about their elders' needs and resources.    \"Research, research, research,\" said White. \"You try to do your due diligence to gather your facts and learn and ask questions,\" said DeVigne. \"I try to surround myself with people who know more than I do.\" Over the years, the couple has done workshops on spirituality and self-care. They say they've also incorporated meditation and other techniques to promote mental and emotional well being. DeVigne says the family's prayers were answered. After weeks of rehab, Evelyn White returned home. \"We're proud of you, Mom, because you've worked very hard,\" said DeVigne. \"It's hard to do rehab in the best of times, but at 104, you're an inspiration to us all.\" Evelyn says she's grateful for her life, and all the care and love she gets from her son and daughter-in-law. They say, over all these years, she has passed down to them her philosophy on life. \"Being nice to everyone and being appreciative of the things that are done for you,\" said White. Since returning home, her family says she has gotten positive reports from her doctors. White is rebuilding some strength in physical and occupational therapy, and she's back at the senior center. The family is reflecting on their experience at Knollwood in the facility-care system. It has given them new perspective and made them think differently about the future. White and DeVigne say they're still figuring out what type of care and care setting they want for themselves. The one thing they know they need and want is human connection. \"I've always said I'd stay in my house until the day I died,\" said White. \"But it dawned on me, you can be isolated all the time. I think that's one of the things that's helped mom, she has never been isolated. We keep her going and it made a difference. It kept her alive!\" The couple's hope is that the country can solve the caregiving crisis and be ready for shifts in the population. They imagine a day when families can afford care, the professional workforce is valued with better wages, and elders get the care they deserve. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96215","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00-05:00","title":"Trump threatens military action in Nigeria over Christian persecution claims","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump, on November 1, 2025, threatened to launch military action in Nigeria and halt all U.S. aid, citing allegations that the Nigerian government is failing to protect Christians from persecution.

Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africa's most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\" Nigeria's population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough. Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions. \"The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,\" Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. \"Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.\" Nigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592332","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:07:00-04:00","title":"Photos: Food banks scramble to get ready as SNAP funding deadline looms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) faces a critical funding shortfall, with 42 million people at risk of losing access to food by Nov. 1 due to the failure to refill EBT cards.

      By Meg Anderson \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A few years ago, Noah Cox noticed something about some of the people he represented in court. They struggled to communicate, think logically or problem solve. \"I wanted to know their account of what happened, and I'd ask them questions. And many of them would struggle with a basic explanation,\" says Cox, a lawyer in the Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office. \"It seemed like they were having challenges related to some sort of intellectual ability.\" What Cox was seeing was indicative of a broader trend: Studies show people with  intellectual and developmental disabilities  are overrepresented in the nation's prisons and jails. He set out to break that pattern, forming a team within the public defender's office known as the neurocognitive disorder team. It's a pioneering effort built on the premise that prison is not always the right place for people with these types of disabilities. 'A cycle of being involved in the system' There are many reasons why someone might experience a cognitive impairment, including conditions such as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Down Syndrome, a traumatic brain injury, or an intellectual disability, which can limit learning and everyday tasks. But many of Cox's clients were never diagnosed with any sort of disability. That doesn't surprise Leigh Anne McKingsley, senior director of disability and justice initiatives for The Arc, a nonprofit that advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. \"Often the disability goes unrecognized,\" McKingsley says. \"They could have gone through their school system not ever really passing much, but it never got documented.\" She says it can be easy for people like this to fall through the cracks. That can lead to trouble. Compared to the general population, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are  more likely to be the victims of violent crimes . But that can go in the other direction, too. \"Often people with intellectual disabilities are misunderstood, and that can lead to this cycle of being involved in the system,\" McKingsley says. A person with this kind of impairment may not understand consequences or be able to discern who's a friend and who isn't. They can be highly suggestible, McKingsley says, and more easily led during a police interrogation. \"They go into a system that doesn't address their disability. They probably come out much worse and more likely to commit more crime or get involved with people that will,\" she says. 'I wasn't aware' Jimmy is 56, and a native of East LA. He's wirey, with tattoos on his neck and glasses that are a little too big for his face. NPR is not using his last name because he and his family worried about the stigma of his criminal record. For as long as he can remember, he has been getting in trouble – with family, with teachers, with the police. \"I wasn't aware of anything, that anything was even wrong,\" he says. \"It took me a while to understand things.\" Jimmy has been homeless, struggled with substance abuse, and been in and out of prison most of his life. He came to Cox's office on a burglary charge. It was a third strike, meaning he already had two violent felonies on his record and would now face a harsher sentence. \"I remember meeting Jimmy,\" Cox says. \"He was trying very hard to tell me something that was very important to him. But I could not understand what he was trying to say.\" Cox asked the judge to appoint a neuropsychologist to evaluate Jimmy. His initial testing showed weak cognitive skills, and an IQ low enough to indicate impairment. \"It became apparent that this was somebody who had a developmental disability, who had not been identified when he was young,\" Cox says. 'They were actually trying to help' Cox, along with a small team of paralegals, interns and social workers, wanted to make the argument that a diversion program, an alternative to prison, would be more appropriate for Jimmy. Being diagnosed with a developmental disability, defined as beginning in childhood, would make Jimmy eligible for California's regional centers, a network that provides support to people with these conditions. Access to such support could improve his chances at diversion. So the team gathered as many records as they could, and interviewed Jimmy's family to get a sense of his childhood. \"They were actually trying to help him. And it was very new to us,\" his sister Sylvia says. Sylvia has always known something was different about her brother. He was late to crawl and speak. He couldn't remember how to adjust the bathtub water temperature. He struggled in school. She says he started getting in trouble with police before he even hit his teen years. \"I think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy for him. The more he was labeled bad, I think the more he became bad,\" she says. After all the interviews and tests, Jimmy was diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability, one he'd had since he was a child. He was 54 years old. 'I'm not frustrated anymore' Skeptics of diversion say they can be too lenient on offenders. But Ricardo Garcia, the public defender who leads the LA County office, says if done right, it can address a person's underlying issues, whether they're related to mental health, substance abuse, or a cognitive disorder. \"You give them purpose and you teach them the skills for self-determination,\" Garcia says. \"It's not telling individuals how to live their life better. It's showing them options so they become aware and can decide for themselves with all the best information available to live the life that most people want to live.\" Jimmy is now a third of the way through his two-year diversion plan. He lives in a group home, attends therapy, and most days he comes to LA's Ladera Park as part of a day program that works with adults with disabilities. His days are looking a lot different than they used to. \"I go to my therapy. I come to this program. I'm busy all the time,\" Jimmy says. \"All I can say is that it offers more than prison has to offer me, because I've just changed my life completely. I don't even use drugs anymore. I'm not homeless anymore. I'm not frustrated anymore. I've traded in my life for a new one.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office has an unusual unit, a team dedicated to representing people who have cognitive disabilities. It's built on the premise that prison is often not the right place for someone with this type of impairment. NPR criminal justice reporter Meg Anderson has the story. MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: A few years ago, Noah Cox started to notice something about many of the people he was representing in court. NOAH COX: I wanted to know their account of what happened. And I'd ask them questions. ANDERSON: Cox is a lawyer in the LA County Public Defender's Office. COX: And many of them would struggle with a basic explanation. And it seemed like they were having challenges related to some sort of intellectual ability. ANDERSON: What Cox was seeing was indicative of a broader pattern. Studies show people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are overrepresented in the nation's prisons and jails. Those are conditions that limit learning and reasoning, like Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. Without support, a person with this kind of impairment might have trouble keeping a job, living independently, knowing who's a friend and who isn't. Once they're behind bars, they're in a system that isn't built for them. They might come out worse off. Cox wanted to disrupt that cycle. COX: Our team is often the first time that somebody is accurately diagnosed. It is sad to me that a lot of my clients at age 30, 40, 50 are being diagnosed for the first time by the criminal legal system. ANDERSON: It's one of the only public defense teams of its kind in the country, partly, Cox says, because it takes a lot of resources to do this kind of work, which brings us to Jimmy (ph). We're not using his last name because he and his family worried about the stigma of his record. JIMMY: I'm 56 years old. I was born and raised in East LA. ANDERSON: Jimmy is wiry, with tattoos on his neck and glasses that are a little too big for his face. For as long as he can remember, he's been getting in trouble with family, with teachers, with the police. JIMMY: I couldn't control myself. I wasn't aware of my sicknesses. I wasn't aware of anything, really - you know? - that anything was even wrong, you know? ANDERSON: He has been homeless and struggled with drug abuse, and he's been in and out of prison most of his life for various crimes. Cox remembers the first time Jimmy came to his office on a burglary charge. COX: He was trying very hard to tell me something that was very important to him. But I could not understand what he was trying to say. ANDERSON: It was his third strike, meaning he already had two violent felonies on his record. Now he could face a much harsher sentence. After some initial testing by a neuropsychologist... COX: It became apparent that this was somebody who had a developmental disability who had not been identified when he was young. ANDERSON: Cox, plus a small team of paralegals, interns and social workers, wanted to make the case that a diversion program - an alternative to prison - would be a better fit for Jimmy, and that would be easier with a diagnosis. So the team gathered as many records as they could and interviewed Jimmy's family to get a sense of his childhood, including his sister Sylvia (ph). SYLVIA: They were actually trying to help him. And it was very new to us. ANDERSON: Sylvia always knew something was different about her brother. He was late to crawl, late to speak. He couldn't do his paper route on his own. He struggled in school. She says he started getting in trouble with the police before he even hit his teen years. SYLVIA: I think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy for him. The more he was labeled bad, I think the more he became bad. ANDERSON: After all the interviews and tests, Jimmy was diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability. SYLVIA: We always knew it. So it was very validating. ANDERSON: That diagnosis made Jimmy eligible for disability services in California. After a lot of discussion with his family, Jimmy chose to seek diversion in his burglary case, and the prosecutor and judge approved. On a sunny day in LA's Ladera Park, Jimmy is going through his workout routine. JIMMY: I do my pushups right here, like, 50. ANDERSON: Yeah. JIMMY: And you feel it burn, you know? ANDERSON: He comes to this park almost every day with a program that works with adults with disabilities. Lately, his days are looking a lot different than they used to. He lives in a group home, goes to therapy. He's a third of the way through his two-year diversion. JIMMY: All I can say is that it offers more than prison has to offer me, you know? Because I'm - just changed my life completely. I don't even use drugs anymore. I don't - I'm not homeless anymore. I'm not frustrated anymore. I'm just - I traded in my life for a new one. ANDERSON: Each time he got out of prison, he felt like he'd take one step forward, then three steps back. Now with a lot of support, he's viewing his life as a clean slate.

A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the White House to use contingency funds to pay for those benefits. But it was unclear how that decision would correspond with  a separate decision  by a judge in Massachusetts telling the administration it had until \"no later than Monday\" to come up with a way to use emergency funds to pay for aid. The impasse over funding the government means that the nearly 1 in 8 U.S. residents who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to buy groceries may be facing at least a temporary lapse in benefits. Following Friday's decisions, President Trump said he had directed government lawyers to find a way to pay for SNAP, and that he instructed them to seek further clarity on the rulings. He cautioned, however, that even with immediate guidance, benefits \"will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.\"  SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the  country's largest anti-hunger program . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general are suing the federal government to keep the payments flowing, arguing the benefits cannot legally be cut off. The Trump administration says it's not legal to extend the benefits using emergency funds — though the administration extended benefits during a shutdown in the first term. As congressional gridlock continues,  states are exploring what they can offer their residents  who've just lost their food aid. Eyes turning to food banks   Food bank administrators are warning that the loss of November SNAP benefits could lead to a public health crisis. Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, likens it to the recession 17 years ago and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end,\" he said. \"When [those] happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food.\" More than 21% of New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits, the highest rate in the nation. People are  turning to food banks to help fill in the assistance gap , but administrators caution they aren't designed to act as a safety net for a government program. \"It's very daunting,\" Riggs told NPR. \"SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network.\" Central Texas Food Bank CEO Sari Vatske said shutdowns aren't like other food crises. \"In a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need,\" she said. Businesses that partner with grocery retailers and restaurants to take surplus or near-expired food and sell it at a heavy discount, like Too Good To Go and Flashfood, are trying to reach people affected. Flashfood CEO Jordan Schenck said the organization has seen a spike in downloads in the last few days. \"That started as [the SNAP cliff] really became more prevalent in the media. We've definitely seen more traffic,\" Schenck told NPR. The view from Capitol Hill   One month into the shutdown, there is no concrete off-ramp. The Senate left D.C. on Thursday for the weekend, ahead of two major pain points of the shutdown coming into sharper relief on Saturday: the SNAP cliff, and the start of open enrollment for health insurance plans sold on the exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act. Health care has been at the center of Congressional Democrats' shutdown strategy. They have demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to  extend the enhanced subsidies , which were boosted during the pandemic. They are set to expire at the end of the year. If nothing changes, Americans who purchase healthcare via the exchange could see their  premiums skyrocket . At a Thursday town hall with Maryland Democrats, including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, Democratic constituents urged the party to hold the line. \"I think they should hold out as long as possible,\" said Maryland voter Christina Thompson. \"It's clear whose shutdown this is. Republicans hold all the leverage and all the cards. And if we back out now, then we're just showing again the party has no backbone.\" Republicans have maintained throughout the month-long shutdown that Democrats must first vote alongside them to fund the government, before addressing the health care subsidies. The typically subdued Senate Majority Leader John Thune R-S.D.,  reproached Democrats  on the floor Wednesday after they tried to pass a measure that would fund SNAP and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). \"This isn't a political game,\" Thune said, raising his voice. \"These are real people's lives we're talking about and you all just figured out 29 days that, oh there might be some consequences?\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95400","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:04:00-04:00","title":"They Were Promised a Lifeline to 'Graduate' from Poverty.

Then it was taken away \n         By Fatma Tanis \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 7:04 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PALABEK, Northern Uganda — Imagine if you were a refugee living at a makeshift settlement in a foreign country with no way to earn a steady income. Then someone promised you a life-changing opportunity: They'd give you a sum of money and a coach to help you turn it into a source of income. But just as you are about to receive that support, it gets canceled. That's what happened to some 8,100 South Sudanese refugees in Uganda this year. They were enrolled in a program with a bureaucratic name — Graduating to Resilience Scale Activity — and a simple strategy: a $205 sum for each participant along with coaching to start a small business. That may not seem like a lot of money, but in Uganda, the average annual income is $753. And in the Palabek camp, home to about 100,000 refugees, most people have no way to earn a living other than occasional farming work, at best making $2 a week. The camp is just around 30 miles away from the border with South Sudan, were a civil war and ethnic violence that began in 2013 led tens of thousands of people — many on foot — to flee to Uganda. New refugees continue to arrive every day as conditions in South Sudan remain unstable.  Before the Trump administration's aid cuts, the residents of the camp relied mainly on food or cash from aid groups to survive.   Last year the U.S. government awarded a $15 million grant to the nonprofit group  AVSI Foundation  to set up what's known as a \"Graduation Approach\" program serving the refugee and host communities. The goal was that in three years, the participants would ... graduate ... from extreme poverty and become self-supporting. In  past studies , similar programs with a onetime cash award plus coaching have produced a \"significant\" increase in the income of participants after 24 months.   In addition to the refugee households, some 3,500 Ugandans living in extreme poverty near the settlement were to participate. The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees in the area has been a strain for locals as they have had to share limited land, water, and firewood resources with refugees. While the refugees can get some help from aid groups, locals often are overlooked, and AVSI's program aimed to bridge some of that gap.  In February 2025   the grant to AVSI was abruptly nullified —  along with thousands of other programs  around the world — as part of the overhaul of foreign aid set in motion by the Trump administration. In the letters the administration sent out to non-profit groups like AVSI, it said the terminated programs were not aligned with U.S. national interests.  AVSI — founded in Italy in 1972 as the Association of Volunteers in International Service — had to lay off 140 local staff recently hired for the Palabek project, according to Rita Larok, the director of programs. As difficult as it was to let staff go, Larok says it was even harder to break the news to the participants, who saw the project as their only way to becoming self-sufficient. Their \"hopes and dreams [were] shattered,\" she says. The disappointment of the lost opportunity has reverberated through the settlement and local towns, says Ugandan official Fivi Akullu, the Refugee Desk Officer for the settlement.  \"If the U.S. government had a heart, actually, this [funding cut] should have been done phase by phase,\" she says. \"It was a very drastic decision to say this is it. No funding, no nothing.\" NPR reached out to the State Department for comment but did not receive a response. On a trip to Uganda, NPR interviewed some of the individuals affected by the cancellation. Akim Joseph Yanga: \"Let us be resilient\" Akim Joseph Yanga was excited about the cash and the coaching. The 63-year-old planned to buy as many as 5 goats — that's what $205 would cover — and start a small livestock business. He was counting on the program coach to help him figure out the logistics of the business and how to best use his skills to build it. The AVSI project gave people hope, says Yanga, who'd fled South Sudan in 2019 because of conflict.   And in the wake of the program's dissolution, he and other camp officials have seen signs of despair:   an increase in cases of violence that have required his mediation, including domestic violence and thefts of neighbors' chickens or goats. There have even been several suicide attempts, he says.  \"It is true that when our father, Donald Trump, started reducing the [foreign aid] budget globally. It affected us very seriously,\" Yanga says, adding that he calls the U.S. president \"father\" because he sees him as a provider to vulnerable people around the world. Yanga has been telling disappointed families in the camp not to lose hope.  \"My message to them is let us be resilient. God will not forget us. The Samaritans will come and help us.\" Santa Angwech: \"I was completely hopeless\" Santa Angwech, a 26-year-old single mom with three children, saw the AVSI program as a lifeline. In anticipation of growing a business with the program, she started making cassava chips to sell in the market from cassava she'd planted in front of her hut, with seeds she had received from aid groups.  More so than the money, she was looking forward to what the coaches would teach her: how to build the business, save money, grow additional crops and even how to deal with the gender-based violence that is part of camp life. In February, she received a text message from AVSI that the program had shut down. \"I was completely hopeless when I saw the message. \"The big question that I have is how you can solve my problems. That is the only thing I need, because if I know how to solve the problem, nothing will defeat me,\" Angwech says. She's not angry at the U.S. for its decision to cut aid.    \"You cannot be angry [at] somebody who refused to give you something because you are just a beggar,\" she says.  Instead, she prays that funding will flow again soon: \"If they do not help us? Where should we start from? What should we do? There is nothing.\" Okot Bosco: \"America benefits, but they don't know\" For Okot Bosco, 36, the new AVSI program was an opportunity he could only have dreamed of as a refugee at the camp — the former teacher had been hired as a coach to guide participants for the 3-year duration of the project. Now he's lost this job — and his hope of using his salary from AVSI to pay back a loan he'd taken from a local bank to build up a small shop selling basic household items.  He's now struggling with supporting his children and wife and has taken up farming work. Bosco believes that President Trump, in making these cuts, doesn't understand that not only do recipients of aid benefit — America, as the giver, does too. \"When you're in a problem and someone helps you, you will never forget that person.\" That philosophy is reflected in his own life. He was born in a displaced persons camp during the Sudanese civil war of the 1980s.  \"I grew up seeing this logo of USAID on the cooking oil can and food boxes — knowing that Americans are the people who can support us in food, education, in medicine, in everything,\" Bosco says. \"America benefits, but they don't know that they are benefiting. They benefit because the people trust them so much.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-store-fire-explosion-hermosillo-9d4f7ead04fbfaa435ff77cb0c1e3768","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:12:55+00:00","title":"Fire and Explosion at Waldo’s Store in Hermosillo Kills at Least 23, Injures 12","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly fire and explosion at a Waldo’s convenience store in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, killed at least 23 people, including children, and injured 12 others.

\n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. On a late autumn day, John Davis hiked through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley, surrounded by flaming red maple trees and yellow birch. A bird flushed noisily through the undergrowth. \"Look there, a ruffed grouse,\" he said, his delight obvious.     This place is an example of what Davis calls \"rewilding,\" which means the footprint of human activity has begun to fade.   \"It simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will,\" he said. \"Some of this was farmed as recently as the 1990s. Probably used for sheep pasture and certainly for logging. You're seeing old stone walls.\" Populations in many countries are beginning to age rapidly and gradually decline, in large part due to individuals choosing to have fewer children.   It's a trend that alarms many experts, and politicians, who say the fabric of whole communities could unravel, but many activists, researchers and economists also see big upsides. This part of New York state, Essex County, has  lost about 6% of its population  since 2010 due to out-migration and the declining birthrate.     Davis, who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, says the pivot toward fewer people is allowing landscapes like this one to heal. \"I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population, I believe we are too many and we consume too much,\" he said. \"We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people.\" Upsides: More choice and a huge decline in teen pregnancy The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged consumerism and accelerated climate change and the loss of wildlife habitat.  \"I love kids, we all love kids,\" Davis said. \"But if we could encourage small families, we'd have a better chance addressing not just the extinction [of species] and climate crisis, but also problems of poverty and inequity.\"  That hope is being tested, as the \"small family ethic\" championed by Davis and other activists arrives in much of the world.   Since the 1970s, researchers say family size dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman on average to roughly two,  according to the latest United Nations data .   Actual population decline has already begun in about half the G7 industrialized countries that make up much of the world's economic activity.   Every one of those countries, including the U.S. has  fallen below the so-called \"replacement rate\"  of births needed to maintain a stable population over the long term.   Without  large-scale immigration, the U.S.  will join the list of countries losing population in the coming decades. Experts say the trend is driven in large part by women choosing to delay having children, having fewer kids, and in many cases, deciding not become mothers at all. \"I just really wanted to do other things with my life,\" said Marian Starkey, who told NPR she and her husband opted not to have children.   \"Most of my friends here don't have children.  People have made the decision they also want to do other things with their lives than raise children.\"  Starkey works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of policies that support this shift toward smaller families and gradual depopulation.   According to Starkey, fewer people will mean a healthier environment, but she also thinks the trend is good news for humans.   \"The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, making sure all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in all parts of the world, especially for girls,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many experts are voicing deep concerns about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have relied for decades on steady growth will function as communities age and begin to decline.   \"I think this has huge implications for which we're not prepared as a society,\" said Martina Yopo-Díaz, a sociologist at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, who studies population loss,  in a July interview with NPR . \"Key social systems, from the economy to the labor market to pensions, are based on the principle that there will be new generations to replace the old ones. But now we see that that principle is no longer something that we can, you know, take as given.\" But NPR also found experts who who view this as a hopeful moment, part of a decades-long trend with benefits for the environment, families and women. Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, said fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier when free to decide for themselves if and when to have kids.   \"To have the number of children they want to have, and to have them at the right time in their lives, is certainly a benefit to couples,\" she said.   None of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR favor efforts that force people to have fewer kids, like China's infamous \"One Child\" policy, which ended in 2016. Instead they support access to reproductive freedom, family planning information, and contraception. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Goldin and other experts said the biggest single upside to the trend toward smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls.  Research shows delaying motherhood  and having fewer children  often leads to more education, more financial security  and better health.  \"The ability of women to decide how many children to have and when to have them, it's something that is a very positive development in the history of mankind,\" said Vladimíra Kantorová, the lead population scientist at the United Nations.   Kantorová points to the fact that much of the falling birthrate in the U.S. and around the world reflects a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. \"Adolescent child bearing has declined everywhere, so this is something that is really a success story,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Those who see advantages in this population shift generally agree that smaller families and declining birthrates will bring serious policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult in many areas.  One question is how to fund the social safety net and healthcare for rising numbers of elderly, when there are fewer young people. John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition.   \"If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated to figuring how a declining population could support its elders, we would achieve that goal,\" he said. \"I think we'd have a happier world, for people and wildlife.\"  \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The first time in modern history, the world's human population is expected to level off and then begin to shrink later this century. It is a trend that will pose a huge challenge as communities begin to age. But as part of our series Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing The World, we look today at what might be some of the benefits. NPR's Brian Mann has been speaking to thinkers and activists who welcome a planet with fewer people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: On a late autumn day, John Davis treks through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley - flaming red maple trees, yellow birch. Not so long ago, Davis says there were people here working this land. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) JOHN DAVIS: Some of this was farmed as recently as, I believe, the 1990s. We're seeing old stone walls. It was probably used for sheep pasture some and certainly for logging. MANN: This place is an example of what Davis calls rewilding. DAVIS: Simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will. MANN: This part of New York state, Essex County, has lost about 6% of its population since 2010 because of migration and the low birth rate. It's a trend happening in a growing number of regions in more and more countries. This kind of slow depopulation worries many economists and business leaders. But Davis, an environmental activist who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, thinks it's overdue. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) DAVIS: I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population. I believe that we are too many and that we consume too much. We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people. MANN: The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged everything from climate change to the loss of wildlife. Here's the fascinating thing. That small family ethic he mentioned, it's already here. Over roughly that same period, beginning in the 1960s, researchers say family size worldwide dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman, on average, to roughly two. In most countries, outside sub-Saharan Africa, population growth has slowed almost to zero, and in many areas, population decline is a reality. Marian Starkey's family is helping shape that trend. MARIAN STARKEY: I just really wanted to do other things with my life. MANN: Starkey says she and her husband decided not to have kids. She works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of this shift towards smaller families and gradual depopulation. Fewer people means a healthier environment, Starkey says. But she also thinks it's good for humans. STARKEY: The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, so making sure that all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in a lot of parts of the world, especially for girls. MANN: Now, again, NPR has spoken to a lot of experts deeply concerned about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have long relied on growth will function as communities age and begin to decline. But we also wanted to hear from people convinced this is a hopeful moment. Claudia Goldin is an economist at Harvard who thinks fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier making their own choices - when and if to have kids. CLAUDIA GOLDIN: To have the number of children that they would like to have and to have them at the right time in their lives is certainly a benefit to couples. MANN: It's important to say none of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR want policies that force people to have fewer kids. Instead, they support access to reproductive freedom and contraception. Goldin and other experts say the biggest single upside to this trend towards smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls. Research shows delaying motherhood and having fewer children can lead to more education, more financial security and better health. Vladimira Kantorova is the lead population scientist at the United Nations. VLADIMIRA KANTOROVA: It's something which is a very positive development in the history of mankind. MANN: Kantorova says much of the falling birth rate in the U.S. and around the world reflects one more positive, a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. KANTOROVA: So this is something which is really a success story. MANN: Even those who see big upsides in this population shift agree smaller families and declining birth rates will mean turbulence and policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult. One big question is how to fund the social safety net and health care for rising numbers of elderly when there are fewer young people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) MANN: John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges, but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition. DAVIS: If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated toward figuring out how a declining population can support its elders, we would achieve that goal. I think we'd have a happier world for people and wildlife. MANN: Most experts agree smaller families are here to stay. People who cheerlead lower population say it's time to lean into that change, planning and working to make sure the benefits outweigh the costs. Brian Mann, NPR News.

great-grandmother helped researchers unravel a dinosaur mummy mystery \n         By Bill Chappell \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 6:02 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         You might not think a paleontologist looking for 66-million-year-old fossils would need to ask a rancher about his great-grandmother's job in the Wyoming badlands. But that's what Paul Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago, did when he was trying to track down a historic site where a famous dinosaur mummy was found in 1908. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sereno's work, published in the journal   Science , brings new clarity about the appearance of the duck-billed  Edmontosaurus annectens , a massive herbivore from the Cretaceous period. Sereno and his team's painstaking work reveals the dinosaur's hooves and spiky tail in exquisite detail. They studied how a fragile clay template can create dinosaur \"mummies.\" But first they had to find them. \"It involved sleuthing archives and finding photographs from these original excavations that no one knew of, and then also talking to ranchers,\" Sereno says of the research. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Looking for a post office  Sereno was hunting for the spot where the famed collector Charles Sternberg discovered a dinosaur mummy in the rough terrain of eastern Wyoming. He managed to find historical photos and a note from Sternberg recounting his path to the site, back in the era of horse-drawn carriages. There were references to Warren, Wyo., — a town that, Sereno says, \"doesn't exist on any map.\" So, he asked around at nearby ranches. \"One of the ranchers had a great-grandmother that was the postmaster of Warren, Wyoming,\" Sereno says. In those days, the post office was on a ranch, he adds. \"And from that, I can calculate a distance to one of the mummies that were found in 1908,\" Sereno says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The area has come to be known as \"the mummy zone,\" where a very thick layer of river sand captured dinosaurs' bodies and preserved valuable information about them. As technicians removed grains of sand from the  Edmontosaurus  specimens, Sereno was fascinated by what they found. \"A mummy is actually a mask of the body, very thin, like the clay you'd put on your face to clean out your pores,\" he says of their specimens. \"And that's what's trapped in the sediment, and not a replacement of the actual skin.\" Vital details about the large dinosaur were captured in fragile clay templates, just one-hundredth of an inch thick. \"For once, we know what a large dinosaur looks like from head to toe,\" Sereno says. \"We've got the bill at the front end, the hooves ... and samples of everything in between, including the crest on the back, the spikes on the tail. We know it, and you could depict it, and it's accurate.\" \"With one exception,\" he adds. \"We don't know the color.\" The two specimens include an adult nicknamed \"Ed Sr.\" and a late juvenile dubbed \"Ed Jr.\" — \"the only juvenile dinosaur mummy ever discovered,\"  according to the university . \"The feet are beautiful\" Sereno's study quickly caught the eye of other experts on the duckbill dinosaur, including Clint Boyd, the paleontology program manager for the North Dakota Geological Survey. His agency has its own  Edmontosaurus  specimen (\"Dakota the Dinosaur Mummy\"), so I asked Boyd what he thinks of Sereno's study. \"The feet are beautiful,\" Boyd says, adding that the new study jibes with much of his agency's work. Both Boyd and Sereno say that some of the terminology in their field could confuse a layperson. They stress that these mummies are nothing like Egyptian mummies, for instance. And when they say  Edmontosaurus  had hooves, they warn not to think of   a horse hoof. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What they're talking about is a hoof like what you see on like a rhino, which absolutely that's what it looks like,\" Boyd says, describing a prominent nail in the front of fleshy pads. Boyd says that while Sereno's specimens are different from what he and his colleagues are working on, the new paper resolves important questions and will help drive new research. \"It's a very thorough study, which is great,\" Boyd says. \"We needed a very good baseline for understanding at least one set of dinosaur mummies in order to then have a reference point to start comparing back to other specimens. So this has been a very long-needed addition to the science.\" Kindling an interest in paleontology This isn't Sereno's first dinosaur rodeo. He's  made big discoveries before . His email address doesn't even use his name; instead, it just says, \"dinosaur.\" The mummy study closes a meaningful loop in Sereno's own life. He notes that the prize specimen that sparked his search, unearthed back in 1908, sits in the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York — and it was a visit to that spot, decades ago, that made a huge impact on a Sereno. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"That's when I decided to be a paleontologist,\" he says of standing next to that exhibit. \"Little did I know my career would end up taking me back to where that mummy was discovered by Charles Sternberg more than a century ago.\" Sereno has a message for young fans of dinosaurs and paleontology: \"If you're an enthused kid, thinking, maybe we found everything. No, we have not.\" Plenty of work remains to make new discoveries and solve more mysteries about how dinosaurs lived, he says. \"For the next two generations, we're going to be finding more things about the deep past and about dinosaurs and other creatures than ever,\" Sereno says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/detroit-michigan-halloween-terror-plot-fbi-patel-d4758edbde0b18c19ca7b38f9e836904","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:10:24Z","title":"FBI Director Kash Patel Faces Legal Challenge Over Alleged Halloween Terror Plot in Michigan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"FBI Director Kash Patel claimed that the FBI thwarted a potential terror attack in Michigan involving a group of young men aged 16 to 20 who allegedly discussed a violent Halloween-related attack in an online chat room, referencing 'pumpkin day' and possibly inspired by Islamic State extremism.

planning to carry out a terror attack on Halloween weekend . Announcing their arrests on Friday, Patel said more information would be coming soon, however the FBI and Michigan authorities have offered few details about the case. Spokespersons for the state and national FBI and the U.S. Attorney in Detroit did not immediately respond to messages Saturday. The investigation involved discussion in an online chat room involving at least some of the suspects who were taken into custody, according to two people briefed on the investigation who could not publicly discuss details. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The group allegedly discussed carrying out an attack around Halloween, referring to “pumpkin day,” according to one of the people. The other person briefed on the investigation confirmed that there had been a “pumpkin” reference. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); However, lawyer Amir Makled, who represents a man from the suburb of Dearborn who was still detained on Saturday, said federal authorities haven’t given him many details about the investigation but after reviewing the matter, he concluded that no terror event was planned.

the two leaders on Saturday agreed on a set of steps to expand their economic and other ties. Their one-on-one meeting came hours after they and other Asia-Pacific leaders wrapped up an annual summit in South Korea with a joint statement pledging stronger economic cooperation. The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the city of Gyeongju took place a day after Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to dial back earlier steps and de-escalate their trade war. During his meeting with Lee, Xi called for Seoul to work with Beijing to “practice genuine multilateralism,” according to Chinese state media, as he continued to position Beijing as the defender of the global trade order upended by Trump’s sweeping tariffs.

Their joint statement declared that the APEC leaders “acknowledge the global trading system continues to face significant challenge.” “We reaffirm our shared recognition that robust trade and investment are vital to the growth and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region,” it says.

The joint declaration said that APEC members remain committed to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, a 20-year growth vision adopted in 2020 that calls for a trade environment that’s “free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); APEC leaders discuss AI and population issues While the summit’s opening session on Friday focused on ways to boost trade and investment, Saturday’s meeting had cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and cultural industries on its agenda. Xi urged Asia-Pacific countries on Saturday to promote the “sound and orderly development” of AI in a way that is mindful of all of humanity’s well-being. He proposed the formation of a new global body called the World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, had quickly left South Korea after the agreement with Xi, leaving the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the APEC summit. The U.S. under Trump has stepped back from efforts to regulate AI and would be unlikely to join the group that China has proposed. APEC leaders also issued a statement Saturday calling for a coordinated approach to the changes brought by AI, which they described as a potential economic catalyst that also poses challenges. Another statement urged cooperation to address declining birth rates, aging populations and accelerated urbanization. On Friday, Xi told the summit that China would support global free trade and supply chain stability — an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump’s protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with the APEC summit, Xi said that “investing in China is investing in the future.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to promote regional economic integration.

captures life inside Chicago Public Schools \n         By Melissa Ann Pinney , NPR Staff \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Melissa Ann Pinney photographed the everyday moments of adolescence inside Chicago Public Schools during a seven-year artist residency. Her series  Becoming Themselves  portrays students, especially those marginalized and underrepresented, as they navigate identity, community and the many transformations of growing up. We interviewed Pinney about the making of her series and the stories behind some of her favorite images. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. What drew you to photograph inside Chicago Public Schools? I was invited by Artists in Public Schools, an organization that pairs artists for residencies in schools all over the city, to photograph Bell School and Ogden International Schools. It was an incredible opportunity to photograph and immerse myself in often overlooked communities of children and teens in Chicago. Since I was in my teens and photographing my own family, childhood and adolescence has been a focus of my work.  Girl Ascending , my 2010 monograph, explored the social lives and coming-of-age rituals of my daughter, Emma, her friends and teammates. The possibilities inherent in widening the scope of my work beyond these established personal connections was exciting. When you first started, what kinds of images or stories did you hope to capture? I'm interested in photography as a process, one of paying close attention to the richness and mystery already present in the everyday world. I capture what's happening in the moment, and the story reveals itself afterwards in contemplation of the work itself. This is an opportunity to make what I think of as real pictures — images that reward sustained and repeated viewings and eschew stereotype and cliché. I had no idea what to expect in the schools, but through trial and error, I found opportunities to make pictures as I became part of the school community. I never know what the students will do next — their beauty, their compassion and their conflicts are unrehearsed. The teens collaborate in the art-making by welcoming me into their world. My photographs are both documents of a time and place and works of art. References to contemporary culture, to history and to ideas of representation are all embedded in the pictures. When I began photographing students in three different Chicago public schools, I had no idea of what was to come — how the project would evolve and shift through an ongoing global pandemic, a renewed focus on systemic racial and gender inequities and rampant gun violence. Now it's a document of a historic time. How much time did you spend working on  Becoming Themselves ? This project is ongoing and still evolving since 2018, when I started photographing in Bell School.  In Their Own Light  was the first book of my early pictures from an elementary, middle and several high schools. In  Becoming Themselves,  I   focus solely on two high schools — Ogden International High School and Senn High School — between 2019 and 2025. What was the most challenging part of this project? It is very hard to witness the grief and ongoing trauma many students experience as part of their everyday lives, especially when we hear that a student in the community has been shot and killed. Tragically, eight students I photographed died that way. The trauma of gun violence reverberates everywhere. What's the story behind one of your favorite photographs? With her My Little Pony leggings and arms loaded with jewelry, Lizzie Williams clearly stood out in the hallway crowded with students at their lockers gathering their coats and bags. I introduced myself and asked if Lizzie wanted to make a portrait. We went to the old gym for its brilliant light and huge south-facing windows. In the midst of working out Lizzie's pose and position, the boys basketball team starting running laps around the gym, casting shadows onto the wall where Lizzie stood. At first I was annoyed by this unexpected disruption, but I soon realized that, far from an unwelcome distraction, the shadows suggest another level of mystery and complexity. I'm grateful for serendipity! The DePaul University Art Museum added this photograph and six others from the project to their permanent collection last spring. A class of Senn students, many of whom are represented in the photographs, took a field trip to the museum to see the works. Were there any moments that surprised you during the process? Many moments surprised me. One day early last fall, a student I hadn't met before asked me to take his picture. I was happy to do so and we found a place by the windows with some light. When I looked through my lens, I suddenly recognized Axle, a student I'd first met two years before, when he transferred to Senn. I had photographed him several other times. Axle had transformed himself radically with a new short hair cut and different style of dress. I am always surprised and moved when a student tells me that the project made a positive impact on their life. Travion Williams, at Ogden International High School, said he was shy, self-conscious and unsure of himself when we made his portrait in 2019. Travion's portrait was one of the 84 portraits installed on panels in the school's front lobby in the summer of 2020. Classes would be completely online that fall, but outdoor sports were still allowed. When the cross country team started practicing, Travion discovered that his friends and teammates recognized and admired him. It changed the way he saw himself. It's rewarding when I'm told by a student that my work is important to them. As my ties to the community have deepened — I've come to understand the meaning this project holds for me and for the students themselves, who tell me they feel truly \"seen\" by participating in the project. The students have profoundly affected the ways I understand the lives of others; my relationships now transcend school to include family events, parties and baby showers. I couldn't have predicted the strong connections I would develop with some of the students, who keep in touch even years after they've graduated. When I brought Sophiat Agboola a print of her portrait, she told me it was inspiring. Surprised, I asked in what way it was inspiring and to whom — I couldn't guess. Sophiat said she had occasionally been made fun of for wearing her natural hair; her portrait had given her the confidence to do so. Of course, the pandemic surprised me. And the fact that a project I expected to last one year could still be challenging and rewarding after seven was a complete surprise, too. Do you have any memorable anecdotes or encounters from your time in the schools ? I photographed Jakolbi Lard only once, at prom in 2019, drawn by the broken heart he had shaved in to his hair. In January 2022, I learned that Jakolbi had been shot and killed. Jakolbi's death and the passage of time bring a different perspective to the broken heart shaved into his scalp. Now I see the wings formed by the mirror frame behind Jakolbi's back. Jakolbi's mother, Patricia Lard, told me that rather than being heartbroken, he was the heart-breaker. She brought Jakolbi's daughter, Jamyah, to an exhibition that included Jakolbi's portrait in 2023. She believes that exhibiting Jakolbi's portrait honors his life. Ms. Lard thanked me for \"... seeing in her Sun (sic) what the world did not.\" Has working in schools changed how you think about education or childhood? The students have a lot more agency than kids in my generation or even my daughter's generation did. These students are free to define themselves through their chosen teams and clubs, their dress, sexual orientation, pronouns and sometimes taking on a new name. There's a freedom in the acceptance and allowance for difference I see and a closeness in the physical camaraderie between many of the students. I started reading the news more closely when I began this project. CPS (Chicago Public Schools) and the CTU (the Chicago Teachers Union) are frequently in the headlines. It's clear that Chicago's past is linked to its present by a history of events affecting the city in housing, education, racial and gender equity and immigration. All of these issues flow through the permeable wall between the city and the public schools. What do you hope viewers take away from seeing these images? I hope these pictures encourage a deeper consideration and appreciation of the radiant young people in our public schools that goes far beyond the stereotypes. I intend these portraits to honor and commemorate those who are vulnerable and often underrepresented. Melissa Ann Pinney is an artist based in Chicago.

(AP) — People across the country formed long lines for free meals and groceries at food pantries and drive-through giveaways Saturday, after monthly benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, were suddenly cut off because of the ongoing government shutdown . In the New York borough of the Bronx, about 200 more people than usual showed up at the World of Life Christian Fellowship International pantry, many bundled in winter hats and coats and pushing collapsible shopping carts as they waited in a line that spanned multiple city blocks. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches. Mary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her SNAP payments. She said she usually splits her roughly $200 a month in SNAP benefits between herself and her two adult sons, one of whom has six children and is especially dependent on the assistance. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “If I didn’t have the pantry to come to, I don’t know how we would make it,” Martin said.

McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the government to report back by Monday on how it would fund SNAP accounts. McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The delay in SNAP payments, a major piece of the nation’s social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Rev. John Udo-Okon said “people from all walks of life” are seeking help now. “The pantry is no longer for the poor, for the elderly, for the needy. The pantry now is for the whole community, everybody,” Udo-Okon said. “You see people will drive in their car and come and park and wait to see if they can get food.” In Austell, Georgia, people in hundreds of cars in drive-through lanes picked up nonperishable and perishable bags of food. Must Ministries said it handed out food to about 1,000 people, more than a typical bimonthly food delivery. Families in line said they worried about not getting SNAP benefits in time for Thanksgiving. At a drive-through food giveaway at the Calvary Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, SNAP recipient James Jackson, 74, said he is frustrated that people are being hurt by decisions made in Washington and lawmakers should try harder to understand challenges brought by poverty and food insecurity. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “If you’ve never been poor, you don’t know what it is to be poor,” Jackson said. “I hope that it turns around. I hope that people get their SNAP benefits, and I hope we just come together where we can love each other and feed each other and help each other.” While there is typically a long line for Calvary Baptist Church’s drive-through events, the Rev. Samuel L. Whitlow said, the walk-in food pantry has seen increased demand recently with roughly 60 additional people showing up this week. And in Norwich, Connecticut, the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry had 10 extra volunteers working Saturday to help a wave of expected newcomers, making sure they felt comfortable and understood the services available. Besides groceries and hot meals, the site was providing pet food, toiletries and blood pressure checks. “They’re embarrassed. They have shame. So you have to deal with that as well,” director Jill Corbin said. “But we do our best to just try to welcome people.” ___ Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut.

The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough. Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.

This term, Trump has been a frequent flier \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 11:31 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         With the government shutdown dragging into its second month and growing more painful by the day, President Trump is spending the weekend in Florida. Saturday he's golfing. On Friday night, he hosted a glitzy gathering at his Mar-a-Lago resort, where guests dressed in sequins, fedoras, feathers and long pearl necklaces. The Great Gatsby-inspired theme for the event was \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.\" This isn't an isolated trip for the president. He has spent nearly two full weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began. There are  missed paychecks  for federal workers,  travel disruptions  and SNAP food assistance is  at risk for millions  of Americans. The White House and Republicans in Congress blame Democrats in the Senate for refusing to support a short-term funding bill that would reopen the government. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"They've lost their minds,\" Trump said of Democrats from Air Force One on his way to Florida. \"All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it.\" Trump spent less than 24 hours in Washington, D.C. this week. Most of the week,  he was in Asia , on a three country trip that started in Malaysia. He was greeted there by a brass band and brightly clothed dancers. Trump got in on it too, doing his signature  Trump dance , swaying with clenched fists. This lengthy foreign trip, Trump's second time overseas during this shutdown, marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a planned trip to Japan during the government shutdown so he could stay at the White House for talks with Republicans who controlled both the House and Senate. \"We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating … trying to see if we could find a way to resolve it,\" said Leon Panetta, who was Clinton's chief of staff at the time. \"Because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down. That, unfortunately, is no longer the case.\" During a lengthy shutdown in 2013, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If the shutdown continues, I won't go,\" Trump said. The shutdown continued. And he didn't go. Back then, though, Trump was talking about negotiating. He was trying to get border wall funding added to a government funding bill. \"Look, this is really something that should be bipartisan,\" Trump said as that shutdown dragged on. \"And we'll see if it is. I hope it is.\" 2019 versus 2025 That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days. He traveled to: Iraq to greet the troops around Christmas Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the dignified transfer of Americans killed in an attack in Syria Camp David in Maryland for a day The U.S.-Mexico border to make the case for border wall funding New Orleans to speak to the American Farm Bureau There were no visits to Mar-a-Lago resort. This time is quite different. Since the start of the shutdown on October 1, Trump has seemingly made no adjustments to his travel plans and normal routines. His travels have included: Two trips to Florida Golfed twice at his course near Washington, D.C. Israel and Egypt to mark the signing of the Gaza ceasefire agreement Stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea during a six day trip Not counting his golf outings in Virginia, Trump spent all or part of 14 days outside of Washington during the first 31 days of the shutdown. Republicans say there is nothing to negotiate until the government reopens Just before Trump returned to the White House from Asia, Vice President JD Vance held a press conference to reassert the administration's position. \"We are not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking,\" he said. There would be no negotiations until Democrats vote to reopen the government. \"We need five more reasonable Democrats to put the American people first and reopen the government. That's all that we're asking,\" Vance said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And it isn't just Trump. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives was away the entire month of October. The Senate has voted 13 times on the same funding bill, failing each time because of a lack of support from Democrats. Senators went home for the weekend on Thursday, with many of them encountering flight delays related to the shutdown. Democrats, who in the past have supported bills like the temporary funding measure Trump and Republicans are insisting on, say they want to negotiate. But, so far Republicans are sticking with their position that there is nothing to negotiate until the government is open. \"Trump can behave however he wants in this situation,\" said Doug Heye, who was deputy chief of staff to a top house Republican during the 2013 government shutdown. \"Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, 'we've done our job, Democrats step up and do yours.' To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging.\" Also, he said, Trump clearly isn't all that concerned with political risk from looking like he isn't engaged in ending the shutdown. Even if Trump keeps teasing a 2028 run  for an unconstitutional third term , the president  is governing like he has nothing to lose, said Heye. \"He is YOLO [you only live once] and he is going to do what he wants, wherever he wants and he is going to push the boundaries as far as he can, because whatever he talks about, he's not going to be on the ballot again,\" said Heye. But Panetta, who served in congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently. He says what's happening now is an abdication of a basic responsibility to govern. \"We've elected these people and they're not there. They've left Washington. They're going on trips,\" said Panetta. \"They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this.\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel as good for the country. \"While Democrats flail, President Trump won't stop delivering historic wins for our country while simultaneously finding creative ways to pay our troops and reduce the suffering as a result of Democrats' far-left priorities,\" Kelly said of Trump's Asia travels. NPR's Sam Gringlas, Saige Miller and Anusha Mathur contributed to this report.   \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   President Trump is in Florida today. That wouldn't be particularly notable, except there is a government shutdown that is creating more and more real-world consequences, including that impending lapse in SNAP benefits. This is not an isolated trip for the president. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump has spent nearly two weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began October 1. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When President Trump arrived in Malaysia earlier this week, he was greeted by a brass band and dancers. Trump got in on it, too, as described in this color commentary that went out on the White House video feed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: In rare, lighthearted moment, President Donald Trump has joined the Malaysian dancers, moving to the cheerful rhythm of the ensemble. KEITH: It was the start of a weeklong trip to Asia that included stops in three countries, but it also marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a trip to Japan during a shutdown. Republicans controlled Congress at the time. Leon Panetta was Clinton's chief of staff. LEON PANETTA: We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating with both Speaker Gingrich and majority leader Bob Dole because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down. KEITH: During the 2013 shutdown, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the shutdown continues, I won't go. KEITH: The shutdown continued, and he didn't go. That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days, and there were no visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. This time is quite different. During the monthlong shutdown, Trump has gone to Florida twice, golfed at his club in Virginia,and visited the Middle East and Asia - 13 days on the road so far with more to come. The White House position on negotiating is different now, too. Vice President Vance spoke to the press yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JD VANCE: We're not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking. KEITH: He said Republicans won't negotiate with Democrats until they vote to reopen the government. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives has been gone all month. The Senate voted 13 times on the same funding bill and failed each time without enough Democratic support. Democrats say they want to negotiate. Doug Heye was a House Republican aid during the 2013 government shutdown, and he doesn't fault the president for leaving now. DOUG HEYE: Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, we've done our job - Democrats, step up and do yours. To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging. KEITH: But Leon Panetta, who served in Congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently. PANETTA: They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this. KEITH: White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel, saying he secured massive investments in the U.S. economy.

Carney also confirmed that he apologized to the president during a dinner at the the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because Trump was “offended.” Ontario’s television advertisement that aired in in the U.S. criticizes Trump’s tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S. President Ronald Reagan . The ad upset Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%. When asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, “Well, you saw what came of it. It’s not something I would have done.” Ford is a populist Conservative while Carney is a Liberal.

Ohtani allowed three runs and five hits in 2 1/3 innings before he was replaced by left-hander Justin Wrobleski. Ohtani walked two and struck out three. He had plenty of velocity, throwing three pitches at 100 mph or above, but not a lot of control. He struck out six and walked one in his Game 4 start, when he threw 93 pitches in a 6-2 loss. Ohtani irked the Blue Jays with lengthy delays before warming up in the first and third innings. He was on base to end the top of the first and made the last out in the top of the third, and each time it took about 4 1/2 minutes before he was ready.

He singled to center off Toronto’s Max Scherzer to begin the game, moved to second on a ground ball and advanced to third on a fly ball but was left stranded when Mookie Betts grounded out. Ohtani is the first starting pitcher with a hit in a winner-take-all World Series game since 1975, when Bill Lee and Don Gullett each got hits. With a one-out single in the fifth, Ohtani became the second player in World Series history with multiple hits in a winner-take-all game he pitched in, joining Cardinals right-hander Dizzy Dean (1934). He added a walk in the seventh. Ohtani’s only prior outing on three days’ rest was on April 21, 2017, when he allowed two hits over seven innings and struck out 11 in a 2-0 win over Kansas City. His start at Boston on April 17 was cut short by a rain delay after two innings and 31 pitches. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Starting Ohtani made more sense than using him in relief. Under a rule adopted for the 2022 season , pitchers who start games in the batting order can remain in the game as a designated hitter after leaving the mound. If Ohtani would start the game only as a DH and then would take the mound, the Dodgers would lose their DH and pitchers would have to bat in that slot if Ohtani was relieved. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-heating-assistance-liheap-winter-7bcec80a167bd01f442d6dabe1149b71","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:31:45+00:00","title":"Funding Delays in LIHEAP and SNAP Threaten Millions Amid Federal Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the federal government shutdown enters its fifth week, millions of low-income households across the United States are facing urgent heating and food insecurity due to delayed funding for key safety net programs. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps over 5.9 million households pay for heating and cooling, is experiencing major disruptions, with states like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Kansas, and New York delaying payments due to the lack of federal allocations. Retirees and vulnerable populations, such as Jacqueline Chapman and Mark Bain, are particularly at risk, as they rely on LIHEAP for heating oil and other utilities. While electric and gas providers can be regulated to avoid disconnections, fuel delivery companies—common in the Northeast—cannot be required to continue service without financial backing.

(AP) — Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk. “I feel like I’m living in scary times. It’s not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn’t too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74. Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes. With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown , now in its fifth week. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.

Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes. “These are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,” Wolfe said. “And I can’t point to a similar time in recent history where we’ve had this.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); States are warning applicants about a funding delay LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades. States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data. While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet. Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary. Minnesota’s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state’s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients’ heating bills until the shutdown ends. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities. Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves. “The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, blamed the federal shutdown and the delay in LIHEAP payments on congressional Democrats and said the Trump administration is committed to reopening the government. “Once the government reopens, ACF will work swiftly to administer annual awards,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within HHS. The spokesperson did not directly answer whether the timing could be affected by the administration’s earlier decision to fire workers who run the LIHEAP program . Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states’ program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available. “Once you’ve fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Low-income families face mounting obstacles Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections. Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast. “If you’re a heating oil dealer, we can’t tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you’ll get your money back,’” Wolfe said. Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago. “I remember the first winter before I knew about this program. I was desperate. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. “I was calling around to my social services people to find out what I could do.” He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter. Bains said he can “get by” if he does not receive the help this year. “I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

this weekend, turning a conference of the nation’s leading Jewish Republicans from jubilation over a tenuous ceasefire in the Middle East into a clarion call to stem the spread of anti-Jewish voices within the party. The emerging schism was laid bare by a prominent conservative think tank president’s defense of talk show host Tucker Carlson’s controversial decision to welcome a far-right activist with antisemitic views onto his podcast Thursday, and Carlson’s hesitation to challenge some of his views. It prompted nearly every speaker who took the podium at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual conference in Las Vegas to call for rooting out anti-Jewish elements in the GOP. Still, the meeting’s proceedings sent a clear signal that the Republican Party has work to do to reconcile views within its ranks about the path forward for Israel in its relationship with the United States, its staunchest ally. But the voices speaking from the podium Friday and Saturday were united in their condemnation of antisemitism. “We are at this point in what I consider sort of the early stages of an undeclared civil war within the Republican Party, as it relates to Israel, and antisemitism and the Jewish community,” Republican Jewish Coalition leader Matthew Brooks said in an interview with The Associated Press. Dispute erupts over whether GOP has pivoted Brooks and the dozens of other speakers who condemned antisemitism within the GOP from the stage before an audience of about 1,000 in the Venetian Resort ballroom in Las Vegas set an ominous tone that cut into the air of celebration many had anticipated over the October ceasefire. Brooks had planned to fold some of his concerns into the three-day, annual conference of Republican Jewish elected officials, fundraisers, media personalities and activists. But comments made just before the meeting by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts denying the conservative group was “distancing itself” from Carlson — a former Fox News host and powerful voice on the right — after his podcast hosted Nick Fuentes prompted a sudden pivot. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Fuentes has said the Holocaust was exaggerated, and that he believes in a global Jewish conspiracy. Carlson has espoused a white supremacist ideology called the “great replacement theory,” which says people of color are replacing white people and that Jews are furthering the change. The video of Roberts’ comments sparked outrage from some Heritage staffers, senators and conservative activists. But they also reflect increasing skepticism toward Israel and of Jews among some on the right, complicating GOP efforts to cast the Democratic Party as antisemitic. For months The Republican Jewish Coalition has been uneasy about Carlson, who has criticized U.S. support for Israel in its war with Hamas and has come under fire for his own far-right views. One is his opposition to Christian Zionism, the belief that some evangelical Christians interpret the Bible as promising the land of Israel eternally to the Jews, thus viewing Israel as belonging to the Jewish people. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Brooks had named others for contributing to the schism, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and conservative social media figure Candace Owens. “And it’s really going to be our challenge going forward to combat that before it has a chance to grow and metastasize in the Republican Party,” Brooks told the AP. That challenge was met by a steady chorus from the podium. “Sadly, we’re seeing antisemitism on the fringes of our own party,” Tennessee Rep. David Kustoff lamented. Republican Rep.

But even as he injected humor, the South Carolina Republican downplayed the threat Fuentes and others pose to the GOP. “You can sit in a basement with weird people and say weird things. It’s a free country, right?” he added. “But if you ever run for office as a Republican, and you embrace this weird s(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk), we’re going to beat your brains out.” Fuentes, who is 27, has 1 million followers on the social media platform X, and his following is generations younger than Graham, who is 70. Brooks said the leak of a series of TeleGram text messages from National Young Republican leaders in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont praising Hitler, joking about gas chambers and other atrocities, which was published last month by Politico, is a symptom of the division he and the coalition are trying to contain. Perhaps that is why dozens of college-age Jewish Republicans attended the conference, cheekily waving red signs emblazoned with “Tucker is not MAGA,” a reference to President Donald Trump’s Make-America-Great-Again mantra, during Florida Congressman Randy Fine’s presentation. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); There was joy at the event, notably over the release of Israeli hostages, many held for more than two years since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, prompting two years of brutal retaliation in Gaza. “I’m sure many of you have spent the last few weeks watching with joy and tears the joyful of Israel’s resilient heroes, reuniting with their loved ones,” said Norm Coleman, a former Minnesota Senator and chairman of the coalition’s board. “It has been a deeply emotional time for all Jewry.” And the testimonials to Trump came from nearly all speakers, praising the Republican president for his role in brokering the ceasefire that resulted in the returned hostages. When an image of Trump was cast on screens in the ballroom, the audience rose in cheers to hear his recorded 5-minute address to the group, in which he declared, “No one has been a greater friend to Israel than Donald J. Trump.” But even enthusiasm over his role was tempered by questions about the terms of the ceasefire, which required Hamas to disarm, disband and have no role in the future of Gaza. Several coalition members saw it as unlikely to hold, especially in light of Israel’s renewed strikes in Gaza after it claimed Hamas had violated the ceasefire terms by firing on Israeli soldiers. Board member Bobby Schostak of Michigan suggested a lasting peace was possible but would take years. “I think we’re some distance away from that,” he said. Coleman was even more grim, suggesting that Hamas still must be completely eradicated. “If they are still part of the equation,” he said. “I think it’s going to be very difficult to hold.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/us-military-strike-drug-smugglers-caribbean-44e98087294f015dc77e17025ecbb5e8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"03:51:28+00:00","title":"U.S. Military Carries Out Lethal Strike in Caribbean Sea Targeting Alleged Drug Smugglers","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military has conducted at least 15 strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September 2025, targeting vessels operated by U.S.-designated terrorist organizations involved in narcotics smuggling.

(AP) — The U.S. military has carried out another lethal strike on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday. Hegseth in a social media posting said the vessel was operated by a U.S.-designated terrorist organization but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike. It’s at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September. “This vessel—like EVERY OTHER—was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth said in a posting on X. The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes. Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels , relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); U.S. lawmakers have been repeatedly rebuffed by the White House in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed.

built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, is threatening Jamaica with catastrophic damage due to its slow movement, extreme rainfall, and powerful winds.

urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/tropical-storm-melissa-soon-a-hurricane-brings-death-floods-to-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:03:42+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa rapidly intensifies, threatening major Caribbean flooding","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa has rapidly intensified into a major hurricane with sustained winds of 120 km/h, threatening the Caribbean region.

millimetres (39.4 inches) of rainfall over a 24-hour period ending late on Monday in parts of Hue and Hoi An.\n\nVietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said the volume of rainfall in Hue marked the highest ever for a 24-hour period since the country started its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue

offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated the northern Caribbean, causing at least 34 deaths across Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even

Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees.

It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' refers to a hurricane named Melissa making landfall in Jamaica, described as a 'storm of the century,' but no specific details, entities, or events are provided in the text to support the content.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/hamas-rejects-us-accusation-it-looted-aid-trucks-in-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"15:02:35Z","title":"Hamas rejects US accusation it looted aid trucks in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas has rejected U.S. Central Command’s claim that it looted aid trucks in Gaza, calling the accusation fabricated and politically motivated.

rejects US accusation it looted aid trucks in Gaza\n\nHamas has denied accusations by the US Central Command (CENTCOM) that the Palestinian group looted aid trucks in the Gaza Strip.\n\nCENTCOM had published drone footage that allegedly showed an aid truck being looted in the enclave. It said in a statement that the drone observed suspected Hamas operatives looting the truck that was travelling as part of a humanitarian convoy in northern Khan Younis on October 31.\n\nOn Sunday, Hamas called the United States’ accusations “unfounded” and “part of an attempt to justify the further reduction of already limited humanitarian aid, while covering up the international community’s failure to end the blockade and starvation imposed on civilians in Gaza”.\n\n“All manifestations of chaos and looting ended immediately after the withdrawal of the [Israeli] occupying forces, proving that the occupation was the only party that sponsored these gangs and orchestrated the chaos,” it added.\n\nHamas said more than 1,000 Palestinian police and security forces had lost their lives and hundreds were wounded while trying to provide protection for humanitarian aid convoys and ensure that assistance reaches those in need.\n\nIt affirmed that none of the international or local institutions, nor any driver working with the aid convoys, has filed any report or complaint about looting by Hamas.\n\n“This clearly demonstrates that the scene cited by the US Central Command is fabricated and politically motivated to justify blockade policies and the reduction of humanitarian aid,” it said, blaming the US for failing to document the ongoing Israeli attacks following the ceasefire agreement that killed 254 Palestinians and wounded 595.\n\nCENTCOM said that the MQ-9 aerial drone was flying overhead to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.\n\n“Over the past week, international partners have delivered more than 600 trucks of commercial goods and aid into Gaza daily. This incident undermines these efforts,” it said in the statement.\n\nHamas said the average number of aid trucks entering Gaza daily does not exceed 135, while the rest are commercial trucks bearing goods that Gaza’s population cannot afford “despite our repeated calls to increase the number of humanitarian aid trucks and reduce commercial shipments”.\n\n“The US adoption of the Israeli narrative only deepens Washington’s immoral bias and places it squarely as a partner in the blockade and the suffering of the Palestinian people,” it said.\n\nThe ceasefire took effect on October 10 under US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan.\n\nPhase one of the deal includes the release of the captives in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The plan also envisages the rebuilding of Gaza and the establishment of a new governing mechanism without Hamas.\n\nSince October 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 68,500 people and wounded over 170,600 across Gaza."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1347","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:28:18+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,347","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of November 2, 2025, the Russia-Ukraine war has reached its 1,347th day, marking more than three years of sustained military conflict.

‘welcomes US assistance’ to fight ‘terrorism’ after Trump’s threats\n\nNigeria says it would welcome assistance from the United States in fighting armed groups as long as its territorial integrity is respected after US President Donald Trump  threatened military action  in the West African country over what he claimed was persecution of Christians there.\n\nIn a social media post on Saturday, Trump said  he had asked the Department of Defense to prepare for possible “fast” military action in Nigeria if Africa’s most populous country fails to crack down on the “killing of Christians”.\n\nA spokesperson for Nigeria’s presidency, Daniel Bwala, told the Reuters news agency on Sunday that the country would “ welcome US assistance as long as it recognises our territorial integrity”.\n\n“I am sure by the time these two leaders meet and sit, there would be better outcomes in our joint resolve to fight terrorism,” Bwala added.\n\nIn his post, Trump said the US would immediately cut off all assistance to the country “if the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians”.\n\nEarlier, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu pushed back against claims of religious intolerance and defended his country’s efforts to protect religious freedom.\n\n“Since 2023, our administration has maintained an open and active engagement with Christian and Muslim leaders alike and continues to address security challenges which affect citizens across faiths and regions,” Tinubu said in a statement.\n\n“The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n\nNigeria, a country of more than 200 million people, is divided between the largely Muslim north and mostly Christian south.\n\nArmed groups have been engaged in a conflict that has been largely confined to the northeast of the country and has dragged on for more than 15 years. Analysts said that while Christians have been killed, most of the victims have been Muslims.\n\nWhile human rights groups have urged the government to do more to address unrest in the country, which has experienced deadly attacks by Boko Haram and  other armed groups , experts say claims of a “Christian genocide” are false and simplistic.\n\n“All the data reveals is that there is no Christian genocide going on in Nigeria,” Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian humanitarian lawyer and analyst on conflict and development, told Al Jazeera. This is “a dangerous far-right narrative that has been simmering for a long time that President Trump is amplifying today”.\n\n“It is divisive, and it is only going to further increase instability in Nigeria,” Bukarti added, explaining that armed groups in Nigeria have been targeting both Muslims and Christians.\n\n“They bomb markets. They bomb churches. They bomb mosques, and they attack every civilian location they find. They do not discriminate between Muslims and Christians.”\n\nEbenezer Obadare, a senior fellow of Africa studies at the Washington, DC-based Council on Foreign Relations, agreed and said the Trump administration should work with Nigerian authorities to address the “common enemy”.\n\n“This is precisely the moment when Nigeria needs assistance, especially military assistance,” Obadare said. “The wrong thing to do is to invade Nigeria and override the authorities or the authority of the Nigerian government. Doing that will be counterproductive.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/israeli-air-strike-kills-four-in-lebanon-straining-fragile-ceasefire","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:25:16+00:00","title":"Israeli air strike kills four in Lebanon, straining fragile ceasefire","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli air strike in the Lebanese town of Kfarsir killed at least four people and wounded three, targeting a vehicle with a guided missile.

defence pact to expand joint military drills and deepen security cooperation in a move widely seen as a response to China’s growing assertiveness in the region, most notably in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nPhilippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr and Canadian Defence Minister David McGuinty inked the Status of Visiting Forces Agreement (SOVFA) on Sunday after a closed-door meeting in Manila.\n\nMcGuinty said the deal would strengthen joint training, information sharing, and coordination during humanitarian crises and natural disasters.\n\nTeodoro described the pact as vital for upholding what he called a rules-based international order in the Asia-Pacific, where he accused China of expansionism. “Who is hegemonic? Who wants to expand their territory in the world? China,” he told reporters.\n\nThe agreement provides the legal framework for Canadian troops to take part in military exercises in the Philippines and vice versa. It mirrors similar accords Manila has signed with the United States, Australia, Japan and New Zealand.\n\nChina has not yet commented on the deal, but it has frequently accused the Philippines of being a “ troublemaker ” and “saboteur of regional stability” after joint patrols and military exercises with its Western allies in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire waterway, a vital global shipping lane, thereby ignoring a 2016 international tribunal ruling that dismissed its territorial claims as unlawful. Chinese coastguard vessels have repeatedly used water cannon and blocking tactics against  Philippine ships , leading to collisions and injuries.\n\nTeodoro used a regional defence ministers meeting in Malaysia over the weekend to condemn China’s declaration of a “ nature reserve ” around the contested Scarborough Shoal, which Manila also claims.\n\n“This, to us, is a veiled attempt to wield military might and the threat of force, undermining the rights of smaller countries and their citizens who rely on the bounty of these waters,” he said.\n\nTalks are under way by the Philippines for similar defence agreements with France, Singapore, Britain, Germany and India as Manila continues to fortify its defence partnerships amid rising tensions with Beijing."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/humanitarian-disaster-worsens-across-sudan-after-rsf-takes-over-el-fasher","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"15:40:49+00:00","title":"Humanitarian disaster worsens across Sudan after RSF takes over el-Fasher","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The humanitarian crisis in Sudan continues to worsen following the Rapid Support Forces' (RSF) seizure of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur.

intention of ending the civil war amid ongoing violence and killings in North Darfur’s el-Fasher.\n\nInternational aid agencies called on Sunday on the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to facilitate increased entry of aid while a  roadmap by mediators  has failed to produce a ceasefire so far.\n\nA week after the paramilitary force seized el-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, after an 18-month siege and starvation campaign, the situation remains catastrophic.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians are still believed to be trapped in the final major city in the western region of Darfur to fall to the RSF while  thousands more are unaccounted for  after fleeing el-Fasher.\n\nOnly a fraction of those who fled on foot from el-Fasher have made it to Tawila, a town roughly 50km (30 miles) away.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera from Tawila, an official with a France-based aid agency said only a few hundred more people have turned up in the town over the past few days.\n\n“Those are very small numbers considering the number of people who were stuck in el-Fasher. We keep hearing feedback that people are stuck on the roads and in different villages that are unfortunately still inaccessible due to security reasons,” said Caroline Bouvard, Sudan country director for Solidarites International.\n\nBouvard said there is a “complete blackout” in terms of information coming out of el-Fasher after the RSF takeover and aid agencies are getting their information from surrounding areas where up to 15,000 people are believed to be stuck.\n\n“There’s a strong request for advocacy with the different parties to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach these people or that at least we can send in trucks to bring them back to Tawila.”\n\nMany of the  people who have managed to survive  numerous RSF checkpoints and patrols to reach Tawila have reported seeing mass executions, torture, beatings and sexual violence. Some were abducted by armed men and forced to pay a ransom on pain of death.\n\nMany more have been forcibly displaced to the al-Dabbah refugee camp in Sudan’s Northern State. Some have been there for weeks.\n\nReporting from the camp, Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said over the past few days, more displaced people have poured in from el-Fasher, exacerbating the humanitarian situation.\n\nPeople are in need of food, clean water, medication and shelter as many are sleeping out in the open. Thousands more could turn to the camp as well as other surrounding areas over the coming days as people flee the slaughter by RSF fighters.\n\nThe United States, Saudi Arabia,  United Arab Emirates  and Egypt, as mediators, have all condemned the mass killings and called for increased humanitarian assistance.\n\n“The RSF must stop engaging in retribution and ethnic violence; the tragedy in El Geneina must not be repeated,” the US Department of State said in a statement on Saturday in reference to the  massacre of Masalit people  in West Darfur’s capital.\n\n“There isn’t a viable military solution, and external military support only prolongs the conflict. The United States urges both parties to pursue a negotiated path to end the suffering of the Sudanese people,” it said in a post on X.\n\nUS lawmakers have also called for action from Washington in the aftermath of the el-Fasher takeover by the RSF.\n\nRepublican Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Friday called for the US to officially designate the RSF as a “foreign terrorist organisation”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/trump-to-host-syrias-al-sharaa-for-talks-at-white-house-envoy-says","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"08:42:40+00:00","title":"Trump to host Syria’s al-Sharaa for talks at White House in November","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is set to host Syria’s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, at the White House in early November 2025, marking the first visit by a Syrian president to the US capital in over 80 years.

We want to establish a very strong partnership between the two countries.”\n\nEarlier, the US news website Axios quoted Tom Barrack, the US envoy to Syria, as saying al-Sharaa is expected to sign an agreement to join an international US-led alliance against the ISIL (ISIS) group during his visit.\n\nAl-Sharaa, who seized power from Bashar al-Assad in December, has been seeking to re-establish Syria’s ties with world powers that had shunned Damascus during al-Assad’s rule.\n\nHe met Trump in Saudi Arabia in May in what was the first encounter between the two nations’ leaders in 25 years.\n\nThe meeting, on the sidelines of Trump’s get-together with the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, was seen as a major turn of events for a Syria that is still adjusting to life after the more than 50-year rule of the al-Assad family.\n\nAl-Sharaa also addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n\nHe once led Syria’s offshoot of al-Qaeda. A decade ago, his anti-Assad group broke away from the network and later clashed with ISIL. Al-Sharaa also once had a $10m US reward on his head.\n\nSyria’s president had joined fighters battling US forces in Iraq before entering the Syrian war. He was even imprisoned by US forces there for several years.\n\nThe US-led coalition and its local partners drove ISIL from its last stronghold in Syria in 2019.\n\nAl-Sharaa’s planned visit to Washington, DC, comes as Trump is urging Middle East allies to seize the moment to build a durable peace in the volatile region after Israel and Hamas last month began implementing a ceasefire and captives exchange. That agreement aims to bring about a permanent end to Israel’s two-year war in Gaza.\n\nThe fragile ceasefire continues to hold, but the situation remains precarious.\n\nSyria and Israel are in talks to reach an agreement that Damascus hopes will secure a halt to Israeli air strikes on its territory and the withdrawal of Israeli troops who have pushed into southern Syria."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/2/live-hamas-continues-search-for-captives-remains-as-israel-blocks-aid?update=4078316","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:15:34+00:00","title":"People return to concrete wasteland as Israel blocks Gaza rebuilding effort","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Gaza, residents are returning to a concrete wasteland as Israel continues to block reconstruction efforts, leaving civilians to face severe shortages of food, water, and medicine.

2025-10-23T15:45:13+00:00\n\nTitle: Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/2/live-hamas-continues-search-for-captives-remains-as-israel-blocks-aid?update=4078334","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:15:34+00:00","title":"People return to concrete wasteland as Israel blocks Gaza rebuilding effort","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early November 2025, Palestinians in Gaza continue to face dire humanitarian conditions, including shortages of food, water, and medicine, as they fear a resurgence of full-scale Israeli bombing.

the Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine said on Sunday that four people, including two children aged 11 and 14, were killed in a Russian air attack on Saturday that set ablaze a shop.\n\nUkrainian officials also said Russian jets bombed a number of trucks and other vehicles in the southwestern Odesa region, killing two people and wounding three.\n\nIn Kherson oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said one person was killed and two injured after Russian forces launched drone, artillery, and air attacks on more than 20 settlements.\n\nA ballistic missile, which local authorities believe was an Iskander-M model with a cluster warhead, landed in the suburbs of Mykolaiv, killing a 20-year-old man and injuring 19 other people, including two children.\n\nIn the front-line Zaporizhzhia region, Governor Ivan Fedorov said one civilian was killed, three injured, and homes were damaged after Russian attacks targeted 18 settlements.\n\nThese attacks also left tens of thousands of residents without power. Fedorov said nearly 60,000 people faced power outages, adding that emergency crews will undertake repairs as soon as the security situation allows.\n\nUkraine’s national energy operator, Ukrenergo, announced scheduled rolling blackouts across the country, which it said were a result of “massive Russian missile and drone attacks on energy facilities”.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine also  launched attacks  on Russian troops and infrastructure. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its air defences intercepted 164 Ukrainian drones, including 39 over the Black Sea and 26 over Crimea, overnight.\n\nUkraine’s military intelligence claimed its forces had dealt a “serious blow” to Russia’s military logistics by launching strikes on the Koltsevoy pipeline in the Moscow region, which spans 400km (250 miles) and supplies gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries.\n\nIt said all three fuel lines were destroyed near the Ramensky district. There was no comment from Moscow.\n\nOn the northeast shore of the Black Sea, a Ukrainian drone attack struck the town of Tuapse, with Ukrainian media reporting that a tanker and an oil terminal pier were hit.\n\nThe two sides also remain engaged in a major battle over the  city of Pokrovsk  that is key to Moscow’s campaign to control the entirety of the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nRussia claimed on Saturday that it killed a number of  Ukrainian special forces  landing by helicopter in the city, while Ukrainian army authorities rejected the notion that they were encircled in the area.\n\nRussian media also claimed on Saturday that two pro-Russian hacker groups have breached six major Ukrainian insurance firms, obtaining personal data on senior political and military officials as well as millions of customers."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39+00:00","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by four environmental NGOs — Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies — reveals that 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel projects have been launched globally since 2021, defined as facilities emitting over one billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetimes.

‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021\n\nTwenty-eight new “carbon bomb” projects have launched across the globe over the past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/2/live-hamas-continues-search-for-captives-remains-as-israel-blocks-aid?update=4078504","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:15:34+00:00","title":"People return to concrete wasteland as Israel blocks Gaza rebuilding effort","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As winter approaches, Palestinians in Gaza face worsening humanitarian conditions, including shortages of food, water, and medicine, due to Israel’s continued blockade that prevents rebuilding efforts.

Hegseth says\n\nThe United States and China have agreed to set up military-to-military channels to “deconflict and deescalate any problems” following the “historic”  meeting  between the countries’ leaders, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, according to the US defence secretary.\n\nIn a statement on X on Saturday, Pete Hegseth said he and his Chinese counterpart, Minister of National Defence Dong Jun, made the decision following a phone call the night before.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Beijing.\n\nHegseth said the pair, who also met in Malaysia following the Trump-Xi summit in South Korea, “agree that peace, stability, and good relations are the best part for our two great and strong countries”.\n\n“Admiral Dong and I also agreed that we should set up military-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate any problems that arise,” he added.\n\nExperts have long advocated direct military contacts between the two superpowers, whose navies operate extensively in the Asia Pacific, saying the hotlines were the best way to avoid unintentional escalation.\n\nHowever, such contacts have remained irregular as tensions between the two nations ebb and rise.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a US-based think tank, said in May that most of the more than 90 communications channels between the US and Chinese governments went dormant during Trump’s first term as US president, from 2017 to 2021.\n\nChina went on to cut the few links with the US military in 2022, under the administration of the US’s then-president, Joe Biden, when the then-speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, visited Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as its province.\n\nThe development was followed by a series of close encounters between the Chinese and US militaries in the contested South China Sea as well as in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThese included the  US military accusing  a Chinese fighter jet of crossing in front of a US surveillance flight over the South China Sea in May 2023, in what it called an “unnecessarily aggressive maneuver”. Days later, in June that year, the US military said a Chinese Navy destroyer sailed across the path of a US destroyer in another “unsafe” manoeuvre.\n\nBeijing, at the time, said the US was to blame, and accused its rival of deliberately “provoking risk” by sending vessels near its shores.\n\nThe tensions eased following a meeting between Biden and Xi in November 2023, with the two leaders also  agreeing to resume  high-level military-to-military communications.\n\nThe CSIS said in May that such communications have been “limited” since Trump’s return to office in January this year. It also noted that the US and China have no crisis management channels, further increasing the risk of escalation, as Trump also ratcheted up a trade war against Beijing.\n\nTrump and Xi, in their meeting in South Korea on October 30, took several steps to lower the temperature, including the US president easing the tariff rate on Chinese goods from 57 percent to 47 percent.\n\nTrump also said that China had agreed to keep the supply of rare earth metals flowing. However, no deal was announced on the sale of TikTok to US investors or on possible plans to sell Nvidia’s advanced semiconductor chips.\n\nTrump also announced that he would travel to China in April, and said Xi would come to the US soon after.\n\nHegseth met Dong, the Chinese defence minister, the day after the Trump-Xi summit, on the sidelines of the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Malaysia.\n\n“I highlighted the importance of maintaining a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific and emphasized U.S. concerns about China’s activities in the South China Sea, around Taiwan, and towards U.S. allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific,” he said in a post on X following the meeting.\n\nThe “United States does not seek conflict, it will continue to stoutly defend its interests and ensure it has the capabilities in the region to do so”, he added.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of National Defence said that Dong had told Hegseth that the reunification of China and Taiwan is an “unstoppable historical trend” and urged the US to exercise caution in both words and actions on the Taiwan issue.\n\nIt quoted Dong as saying that China was committed to peaceful development while resolutely safeguarding its national security interests.\n\n“It possesses the full capability to respond calmly to any infringements or provocations,” the statement added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2910-02-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, from public health (HPV vaccine rollout in Pakistan, misinformation claims about Tylenol and autism in the US), climate change (mosquitoes spreading into Iceland), AI-related risks (misinformation, data privacy, infrastructure outages), environmental threats (Forever Chemicals), and geopolitical tensions (US-China trade and tariffs).

2025-10-26T05:51:09+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti\n\nHurricane Melissa  has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba in late October 2025, killing around 50 people in Jamaica and at least 31 in Haiti.

Caribbean after battering communities in Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba for days, leaving a trail of devastation that killed about 50 people.\n\nThe hurricane smashed into Jamaica with enormous force on Tuesday as a Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black River.\n\n“Everything is gone,” said Michelle Barnes as she and her 13-year-old daughter secured their portion of handouts from local food establishments that were giving away their goods, many of which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down.

Wrexham toddler eats books, toys and doorframes due to disorder\n\nMany parents wish they had eyes in the back of their head when their toddlers start reaching for things they shouldn't, but for Jess Harry, it seems nothing is off limits for her son Junior.\n\nThe mum-of-two first became aware that he liked to try and eat inedible items when he licked the Velcro in his tactile books as a baby.\n\nSince then, the 21-month-old has \"scoffed\" sand \"by the handful\" and eaten playgroup rugs as well as furniture all over his home, including his own cot.\n\nIt wasn't until September that Junior received a diagnosis of  pica  - a condition where a person repeatedly craves and eats non-edible items with no nutritional value.\n\n\"Even if nothing is available to him he'll seek it out, he will find something,\" said Jess, from Brymbo, Wrexham.\n\nThe 31-year-old had to pull Junior out of nursery because he was eating \"a disgusting amount of sand\".\n\nJess admits the ridiculous nature of the situations Junior sometimes finds himself in - but said there was a serious side too.\n\nJess had to move Junior into a metal toddler bed after he started eating his wooden cot, but this meant he could get out in the night and he chewed his door frame.\n\nThis led to him having lead in his blood as \"the old layers of paint have got lead in\".\n\nJunior is now in a travel cot or playpen until the problem is resolved and Jess raised the issue of lead paint with her housing association, Clwyd Alyn, but said she wasn't taken seriously and no action was taken.\n\nClwyd Alyn said repair work was scheduled to be carried out at the property and it would \"continue to liaise with the family and swiftly act on appropriate guidance about how to deal with this situation going forward\".\n\nThere's a variety of textures that Junior goes for, but Jess said wood and cardboard were his current obsessions.\n\nHe and his brother Jack, seven, like playing with Hot Wheels but Jess has to keep Junior's in a plastic tub after he bit through the basket they got for his toy cars.\n\nOn one trip to the supermarket to pick up a blind, Jess was walking out of the shop with Junior and \"by the time we got to the car he'd chewed through the box the blind was in\".\n\n\"It takes literally seconds. I know it sounds unbelievable.\"\n\nJess had never heard of pica but, following a suggestion by a play leader, their health visitor requested blood tests that revealed iron deficiency - one of the possible causes of pica - and Junior was able to get a diagnosis.\n\nLiquorice root is one \"safe alternative\" the family use to tempt Junior towards more edible fare.\n\nIt seems to work because it's \"literally a stick\" but isn't suitable for when he's playing as it could be a choking hazard.\n\nAnother recent swap is Weetabix, which mimics the dry, crunchy texture Junior favours.\n\n\"He cannot be left alone. If I leave him in the living room, which is a Junior-safe zone apart from the walls, there's still something that he does, or goes for,\" Jess said.\n\n\"I just think, what next? I joke and say I need to live in an empty shipping container.\"\n\nJess said Junior was \"really fussy food-wise anyway\", making alternatives difficult, but hopes she can \"reason with him a little bit\" when he gets older.\n\nThe National Pica Advisory Service , which offers specialist training and advice, said it had supported 250 families since it was established in 2023.\n\nIt stressed pica could be fatal, citing the cases of  21-year-old James Frankish  and  19-year-old Owen Garnet .\n\nThe organisation has drafted guidelines for health, social care, housing and education services for assessing, diagnosing and supporting people with pica, with the aim of getting these formally adopted.\n\nJess wishes more people knew about the condition so she didn't have to keep repeating herself, could access more support and feel less alone.\n\n\"Someone will invite you to the park and I feel like I'm just making excuses all the time but I know that I might as well stay home, because it's more stressful for me to be in the park.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw42j29lqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"16:34:04.044+00:00","title":"Louvre jewellery heist carried out by petty criminals, Paris prosecutor says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major jewellery heist at the Louvre museum in Paris on 19 October 2025, involving theft of items worth €88 million, was carried out by petty criminals from the impoverished Seine-Saint-Denis area, not organised crime.

\"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".\n\nShe said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.\n\nOn Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was

papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jw1xxz7lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"03:16:22.776+00:00","title":"How to cope with loneliness in your first year of university","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Many first-year university students, including Robert Medhurst, Alisha Miah, and Christina Aaliyah Davis, report feeling isolated during their early months due to social media comparisons, lack of initial social connections, and cultural mismatch—such as Alisha’s discomfort with drinking.

in your first year of university\n\nRobert Medhurst spent most of his freshers' week looking at social media, reading posts about other students' fun nights out.\n\n\"I was just in bed,\" Robert recalls, describing the week as the loneliest time of his life.\n\nRobert's flatmates didn't go out much, and his course didn't feel very sociable.\n\nDespite putting himself out there by going to taster sessions for various societies, he couldn't find his people.\n\n\"I started to lose my confidence,\" he says. \"I felt like people didn't want to be friends with me, or they didn't like me.\"\n\nInitially, Robert had no intention of going to university and had a job offer for after sixth form. But then he saw his friends living it up as students on Instagram and Snapchat.\n\n\"When you've got to get up for work on Thursday at 9:00 and you see someone's been out on Wednesday night, you do start thinking the grass is greener,\" Robert says.\n\nSick of the FOMO, and wanting to keep his career options open, Robert decided to apply to Nottingham Trent to study business. He chose the university because of its reputation for student life: \"I did so much research to make sure I was confident in my choice.\"\n\nBut in a matter of days, Robert was considering dropping out.\n\n\"Social media makes it worse,\" he says of those early months of his first year, explaining that other people's posts about student life can make it feel like \"everyone's getting along, but I'm not\".\n\nIn a TikTok video, Robert posted about feeling lonely during freshers' week. The comments section was flooded with other students sharing similar experiences.\n\nTV shows and social media can glorify the idea of student life. Lots of people come to university with high expectations for what they think could be the best years of their lives: living with their friends, going on nights out, studying a subject they love, and getting stuck in with a new sport or hobby.\n\nBut for some, the experience isn't what they expect.\n\nSome students come to university with \"rose-tinted glasses\", says Lauren Howard, who manages counselling services at the University of Bradford.\n\nIn a poll of freshers in their first week at Swansea University, students' biggest concern was fitting in and feeling included, says Joanne Parfitt, the university's associate director of transition and progression.\n\nAnd in a survey by market research agency Cibyl, 17% of students said they had no friends at university and 37% said they worried daily or weekly about making friends.\n\n\"[New students] find it quite daunting because if you've left school or sixth form, you have your friendship groups that you have to leave,\" Ms Parfitt says. \"For some, it's an opportunity to start again and create a new identity. But for many, it's really daunting.\"\n\nAlisha Miah's TikTok feed was full of videos of girls having fun while living together in student houses - having movie nights and picnics, going on trips together.\n\nBut when Alisha moved from London to Sheffield in September 2024 to study journalism, she found freshers' week \"overwhelming\" because of how much alcohol it involved.\n\nAlisha doesn't drink and had never been clubbing before.\n\n\"I did spend a lot of freshers' week in my room,\" she says. \"I just felt a bit alienated.\"\n\nThis continued over Alisha's first few months at university. \"I felt anxious when socialising,\" she says. \"I also feel I didn't put myself out there enough.\"\n\nLike Robert, Alisha considered dropping out or switching courses, but decided not to because she felt she was at university to study, not to make friends.\n\nIn a 2025 survey of more than 10,000 undergraduate students by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) and the charity Advance HE, 29% said they had considered dropping out.\n\nThe most common reason, was their mental and emotional health, followed by financial concerns.\n\nAs new students navigate trying to make friends, living away from family and potentially budgeting for the first time, \"it's difficult to imagine a more challenging time\", says Mrs Howard, from the University of Bradford.\n\n\"Anxiety about all of these different things is massively common, and normal.\"\n\nThough Christina Aaliyah Davis enjoyed her time studying medicine at Newcastle University, she says it wasn't the \"utopia of friendship\" her family told her it would be.\n\n\"It was almost like there was this pressure to see university as this magical, friendly place where everyone is singing and dancing together,\" the 24-year-old doctor says.\n\nWhen she was in sixth form, she dreamed of having dinners with her university flatmates and hosting Halloween parties. But Christina wasn't very close to her first-year flatmates and sometimes felt lonely.\n\n\"I felt like I missed out a little bit,\" she says.\n\nWith time, Robert, Alisha and Christina all found their feet and developed friendships.\n\nAlisha made friends through her course and through TikTok, while Christina felt happier once she was able to move in with friends after her first year.\n\nFor Robert, now 24 and in his final year, it was joining his university's drama society and getting a part-time job at a bar that helped him make friends. He also enjoyed volunteering at freshers' week in his second and third years, helping new students settle in.\n\nRobert's advice to first-year students struggling to socialise is to just \"get out of your room\" and go to club and society taster events until you find one you enjoy. And he recommends continuing to turn up, even if it feels a bit awkward at first.\n\n\"After a few weeks of consistently showing up, people recognise your face,\" Robert says, \"you recognise theirs, and you start making friends\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvee260n8eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"16:47:30.481+00:00","title":"ACA open enrollment begins with spike in healthcare premiums","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act marketplace begins, Americans face potentially skyrocketing healthcare costs due to the expiration of tax credits.

2025-11-02T00:45:10.673+00:00\n\nTitle: Devastation on repeat: How climate change is worsening Pakistan's deadly floods\n\nRescuers and relatives searched knee-deep in water for the body of one-year-old Zara. She'd been swept away by flash floods; the bodies of her parents and three siblings had already been found days earlier.\n\n\"We suddenly saw a lot of water. I climbed up to the roof and urged them to join me,\" Arshad, Zara's grandfather, said, showing the BBC the dirt road where they were taken from him in the village of Sambrial in northern Punjab in August.\n\nHis family tried to join him, but too late. The powerful current washed away all six of them.\n\nEvery year, monsoon season brings deadly floods in Pakistan.\n\nThis year it began in late June, and within three months, floods had killed more than 1,000 people. At least 6.9  million were affected, according to the United Nations  agency for humanitarian affairs, OCHA.\n\nThe South Asian nation is struggling with the devastating consequences of climate change, despite emitting just 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTo witness its effects, the BBC travelled from the mountains of the north to the plains of the south for three months. In every province, climate change was having a different impact.\n\nThere was one element in common, though. The poorest suffer most.\n\nWe met people who'd lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones – and they were resigned to going through it all again in the next monsoon.\n\nMonsoon floods started in the north, with global warming playing out in its most familiar form in Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nAmid the high peaks of the Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush, there are more than 7,000 glaciers. But due to rising temperatures, they are melting.\n\nThe result can be catastrophic: meltwater turns into glacial lakes which can suddenly burst. Thousands of villages are at risk.\n\nThis summer hundreds of homes were destroyed and roads damaged by landslides and flash floods.\n\nThese \"glacial lake outbursts\" are hard to warn against. The area is remote and mobile service poor. Pakistan and the World Bank are trying to improve an early warning system, which often doesn't work because of the mountainous terrain.\n\nCommunity is a powerful asset. When shepherd Wasit Khan woke up to rushing waters, with trailing chunks of ice and debris, he ran to an area with a better signal. He began warning as many villagers as he could.\n\n\"I told everyone to leave their belongings, leave the house, take their wives, children and elderly people and get away,\" he told BBC Urdu's Muhammad Zubair.\n\nThanks to him, dozens were saved.\n\nThe danger took a different form in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nIn Gadoon, the BBC found hundreds of villagers digging through piles of rocks with their bare hands.\n\nA cloudburst had caused a flash flood early in the morning, a local official said. That happens when a sudden updraft in humid, moist air leads to a heavy and localised burst of rain. The current washed away several homes and triggered a landslide.\n\nMen from neighbouring villages rushed over to help, which was invaluable – but not enough. The excavators the villagers desperately needed were trapped in flooded roads, some blocked by massive rocks.\n\n\"Nothing will happen until the machines arrive,\" one man told the BBC.\n\nThen a silence suddenly blanketed the area. Dozens of men stood still in one corner. The bodies of two children, soaked in dark mud, were pulled from under the rubble, and carried away.\n\nScenes like this played out across the province, with rescuers delayed due to uprooted trees and major infrastructure being destroyed. A helicopter carrying aid crashed in the bad weather, claiming the lives of all crew on board.\n\nIn villages and cities, millions have settled around rivers and streams, areas prone to flooding. Pakistan's River Protection Act - which prohibits building within 200 ft (61m) of a river or its tributaries - was meant to solve that issue. But for many it's simply too costly to settle elsewhere.\n\nIllegal construction makes matters worse.\n\nClimate scientist Fahad Saeed blames this on local corruption and believes officials are failing to enforce the law. He spoke to the BBC in Islamabad, next to a half-built, four-storey concrete building as big as a car park - and right by a stream that he saw flood this summer, killing a child.\n\n\"Just a few kilometres from parliament and still such things happen in Pakistan,\" he says, visibly frustrated. \"It's because of misgovernance, the role of the government is to be a watchdog.\"\n\nFormer climate minister Senator Sherry Rehman, who chairs the climate committee in Pakistan's Senate, calls it \"graft\", or simply \"looking the other way\" when permissions are given for construction in vulnerable areas.\n\nBy late August, further south in the province of Punjab, floods had submerged 4,500 villages, overwhelming \"Pakistan's breadbasket\", in a country that can't always afford to import enough food.\n\nFor the first time, three rivers - the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab - flooded simultaneously, triggering the largest rescue operation in decades.\n\n\"It was the most important anomaly,\" said Syed Muhammad Tayyab Shah, the chief risk officer for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).\n\nIn Punjab's capital, Lahore, the impact on wealthier and poorer communities was stark. The gated community of Park View City was inundated by the Ravi river, making its prized streets impossible to navigate. Residents of luxury homes were forced to evacuate.\n\nSurveying the damage, two local men, Abdullah and his father Gulraiz, were convinced water would be drained soon, thanks to the area's property developer Aleem Khan, a federal minister.\n\n\"No problem, Aleem Khan will do it,\" Gulraiz told the BBC.\n\nBut for residents in the poorer neighbourhood of Theme Park, the floods were crushing. One officer told the BBC they kept having to rescue people who swam back to their homes when the water levels dropped, desperate to salvage whatever they could. But then the water would rise, leaving them stranded.\n\nWe saw one man returning from his house, an inflatable donut resting on his hip.\n\nSome residents were moved to tents provided by the Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan. Sitting outside in the summer heat, Sumera was weeks away from giving birth. She was extremely thin.\n\n\"My doctor says I need two blood transfusions this week,\" she said as she tried to keep hold of her toddler, Arsh.\n\nNearby, Ali Ahmad was balancing a small kitten he rescued from the floods on his shoulder. The boy was one of the few who had a mattress to sleep on.\n\nBy the end of monsoon season, the floods had displaced more than 2.7 million people in Punjab, the UN said, and damaged more than one million hectares of farmland.\n\nFurther south in Multan district, always hit hard by floods, the scale of the humanitarian crisis became even clearer, with tents lining dirt roads and highways.\n\nAccess to healthcare was already a challenge in rural areas of Pakistan, but once the floods hit, the challenge was unbearable for many women we met.\n\nBBC Urdu's Tarhub Asghar met two sisters-in-law, both nine months pregnant. A doctor had warned them they weren't drinking enough water. They raised a bottle to explain. The water was completely brown.\n\nSome are trying different solutions.\n\nArchitect Yasmeen Lari has designed what she calls \"climate-resilient houses\" in dozens of villages. In Pono, near Hyderabad, women showed the BBC huts they'd built themselves - a large circular building on wooden stilts. Dr Lari calls it their training centre and says families can move their belongings there and shelter.\n\nBut Dr Lari argues building an entire village on stilts would be unfeasible and too expensive. Instead, she says her designs ensure the roofs don't collapse, and that by using natural materials such as bamboo and lime concrete, the homes can be rebuilt quickly by the villagers themselves.\n\nPakistan has reached a point where \"it's not about saving buildings; it's about saving lives,\" she says.\n\nThis is the reality for Pakistan. All the climate scientists and politicians the BBC spoke to warn of an increasingly worrying future.\n\n\"Every year the monsoon will become more and more aggressive,\" Syed Muhammad Tayyab Shah at the NDMA said. \"Every year, there will be a new surprise for us.\"\n\nAs the country faces the growing and ever-changing challenges posed by climate change, in which the poorest are often the worst affected, there is one refrain from people returning to homes likely to flood next year: \"I have nowhere else to go.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1rnnd5gjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"23:39:02.052+00:00","title":"Tourism to Xinjiang booms as China gives the region a makeover","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the dramatic rise in tourism to Xinjiang, China, from a region once considered dangerous and politically unstable to a rapidly expanding destination for both domestic and international visitors.

her friends were perplexed.\n\n\"They couldn't understand why I'd visit a place that back then was considered one of China's most dangerous areas.\"\n\nOne of her friends pulled out of the trip and started \"ghosting\" her on WeChat, said the 35-year-old Chinese national, who did not want to reveal her real name.\n\n\"She said her parents forbade her from going anywhere near Xinjiang and did not want to engage further.\"\n\nAnna went anyway, and returned this June. But it had changed, she says.\n\n\"Xinjiang was as beautiful as I remember it, but there are far too many tourists now, especially at the major attractions.\"\n\nFor years, Xinjiang had bristled under Beijing's rule, sometimes erupting into violence, which kept many domestic Chinese tourists away. Then it became infamous for some of the worst allegations of Chinese authoritarianism, from the detention of more than a million  Uyghur Muslims  in so-called \"re-education camps\", to  claims of crimes against humanity , by the United Nations.\n\nChina denies the allegations, but the region is largely cut off to international media and observers, while Uyghurs in exile continue to recount stories of terrified or disappeared relatives.\n\nAnd yet in recent years Xinjiang has emerged as a tourist destination – within China and, increasingly, outside of the country. Beijing has pumped in billions of dollars to develop infrastructure, help produce TV dramas set in its unusual landscapes, and has occasionally welcomed foreign media on carefully orchestrated tours.\n\nIt has been repackaging the controversial region into a tourist haven, touting not just its beauty but also the very local \"ethnic\" experiences that rights groups say it is trying to erase.\n\nStretched across China's north-west, Xinjiang borders eight countries. Located along the Silk Road, which fuelled trade between the East and West for centuries, some of its towns are packed with history. It is also home to remote, rugged mountains, majestic canyons, lush grasslands and pristine lakes.\n\n\"The views exceeded my expectations by miles,\" says Singaporean Sun Shengyao, who visited in May 2024 and describes it as \"New Zealand, Switzerland and Mongolia all packed into one place\".\n\nUnlike most of China which has a Han majority, Xinjiang mostly has Turkic-speaking Muslims, with the Uyghurs being the largest ethnic group. Tensions escalated throughout the 1990s and 2000s as Uyghur allegations of marginalisation by Han Chinese spurred separatist sentiments and deadly attacks, which intensified Beijing's crackdown.\n\nBut it is under Xi Jinping that the Chinese Communist Party has begun tightening control like never before, sparking allegations of the forcible assimilation of Uyghurs into Han Chinese culture. On a visit in September, he hailed the region's \"earth-shattering\" development and called for the \"Sinicisation of religion\" – the transformation of beliefs to reflect Chinese culture and society.\n\nMeanwhile investment has been pouring into the region. Some 200 international hotels, including prominent names like Hilton and Marriott, are either already operating or planning to open in Xinjiang.\n\nIn 2024, the region welcomed some 300 million visitors, more than double the number in 2018, according to Chinese authorities. Tourism revenue from Xinjiang grew about 40% over this period to reach 360 billion yuan ($51bn; £39bn). In the first half of this year, some 130 million tourists visited the region, contributing about 143bn yuan in revenue.\n\nWhile foreign tourism has been growing, the vast majority are domestic visitors.\n\nBeijing now has an ambitious target: more than 400 million visitors a year, and tourism revenue of 1 trillion yuan by 2030.\n\nSome people are still scared to go. Mr Sun says it took him a while to gather friends for a trip in May 2024 as many of them saw Xinjiang as unsafe. The 23-year-old himself had a bout of the jitters, but as the trip continued, they vanished.\n\nThey started off in the bustling streets of the regional capital, Urumqi. They then spent eight days on the road with a Chinese driver, travelling through mountains and lush steppes, which left Mr Sun in awe.\n\nIt is common for drivers and tour guides in Xinjiang to be Han Chinese, who now make up about 40% of the region's population. Mr Sun's group did not interact extensively with local Uyghurs, but the few they managed to strike up conversations with were \"very welcoming\", he says.\n\nSince he has returned, Mr Sun has become somewhat of an advocate for Xinjiang, which he says has been \"misunderstood\" as dangerous and tense. \"If I can inspire just one person to learn more about the province, I would have helped reduce the stigma by a little.\"\n\nTo him, the stunning sights he enjoyed as a tourist seem far removed from the disturbing allegations that put Xinjiang in global headlines. All he saw was evidence that Xinjiang remains highly surveilled, with police checkpoints and security cameras a common sight, and foreigners required to stay in designated hotels.\n\nBut Mr Sun was unfazed by that: \"There is heavy police presence, but that's not to say that this is a big problem.\"\n\nNot every tourist is convinced that what they are seeing is the \"real\" Xinjiang.\n\nSingaporean Thenmoli Silvadorie, who visited with friends in May for 10 days, says: \"I was very curious about Uyghur culture and wanted to see how different things may be there. But we were quite disappointed.\"\n\nShe and her friends were wearing hijabs and, she says, Uyghur food vendors had approached them saying they were \"envious we could freely wear our hijabs... but we didn't get to have very deep conversations\". They also weren't allowed to visit most local mosques, she adds.\n\nStill, the allure for foreign visitors is strong. China itself is a hugely popular destination, and Xinjiang has emerged as an \"untouched\", less commercialised option.\n\nA growing number of foreigners are \"approaching Xinjiang with open minds and a genuine desire to see and assess the truth for themselves\", China's state-run newspaper Global Times wrote in May.\n\nThe party has also been quick to promote content on Xinjiang by foreign influencers that aligns with the state's narrative. Among them is German vlogger Ken Abroad, who in one of his videos said he'd seen \"more mosques [in Xinjiang] than in the US or any countries in Europe\".\n\nBut others take a different view. Writer Josh Summers, who lived in Xinjiang in the 2010s, tells the BBC the city of Kashgar's Old Town was \"completely torn down, reimagined and rebuilt in a way that doesn't reflect Uyghur culture in any way\".\n\nAccording to a Human Rights Watch report from 2024, hundreds of villages in Xinjiang had their names - which were related to the religion, history or culture of Uyghurs -  replaced  between 2009 and 2023. The group has also accused authorities of  closing, destroying and repurposing mosques  in Xinjiang and across China to curb the practice of Islam.\n\nGrave rights violations have also been documented by other international organisations, including the UN. The BBC's reporting from 2021 and 2022 found evidence supporting the existence of detention camps, and allegations of sexual abuse and forced sterilisation.\n\nBeijing, however, denies all of this. Within the country, the party has been remaking the image of what was once seen as a troubled province to woo more domestic tourists. And it appears to be working.\n\nWhen Anna went for the second time, it was with her mother, who was eager to visit after watching a drama series set in the mountainous Altay prefecture in the north. The series, To the Wonder, was funded by the government and promoted on state media.\n\nAltay has plenty of fans on the Chinese internet. \"Who would have known that I'd wander into God's secret garden in Altay? At the Ka Nasi Lake, I finally understood what it means to be in paradise. This is a place where the romance of mountains, rivers, lakes and the seas are woven together in a single frame,\" reads one comment on RedNote.\n\nAnother says: \"At dawn, I watch from the guesthouse as the cattle graze the fields. Golden birch forests glow in the sunlight, and even the air seems wrapped in sweetness – such undisturbed beauty is the Altay I've always longed for.\"\n\nTravel agencies describe the region as \"exotic\" and \"mysterious\". It offers a \"magical fusion of nature and culture you won't experience anywhere else in China\", says one such agency, The Wandering Lens. The prices for these tours vary. A 10-day trip could set you back between US$1,500 and US$2,500 (£1,100-1,900), excluding flights.\n\nA typical itinerary for the north would include the Kanas National Park, with outings to alpine lakes and the popular five-coloured beach, and a visit to a Uyghur village where you can ride on carriages and spend time with a Uyghur family.\n\nThings get more adventurous in the south, where trips often include drives through the desert, various lake excursions, and a visit to Kashgar, a 2,000-year-old Silk Road city.\n\nVisitors share their itineraries online, complete with coloured-coded route maps and snaps of Uyghur delicacies, like the spicy stew, \"big plate chicken\", grilled lamb skewers, and wine made with horse milk. Some even mention \"hours-long performances that recreate the splendour of the Silk Road\".\n\nIf you search for Xinjiang on social media platforms RedNote and Weibo, as you'd expect, you get posts raving about its beauty and iconic architecture. There is no mention of the allegations that clash with this idyllic appeal.\n\nAt this time of the year, Chinese social media is awash with photographs of Xinjiang's poplar forests bathed in autumn's amber glow.\n\nThe Communist Party is \"selling its own version of Uyghur culture by presenting Uyghur people as tourist attractions\", says Uyghur-American Irade Kashgary who left the region in 1998.\n\n\"They are telling the world we're no more than dancing, colourful folk who look good on social media.\"\n\nWatching her hometown grow in popularity from across the Pacific, Ms Kashgary, the Uyghur activist, urges tourists to \"recognise the serious issues\" in Xinjiang.\n\n\"It's not my place to tell people not to visit, but they need to realise that what they experience there is a whitewashed version of [Xinjiang],\" she says.\n\n\"Meanwhile, people like me will never be able to go back because of our activism. It is far too dangerous... and yet, why can't I? This is my homeland.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c201xe61x0lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"00:07:32.538+00:00","title":"Molecule: The dangerous weight-loss drug that went viral on Russian TikTok","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Molecule, a weight-loss pill containing the banned substance sibutramine, has gone viral on Russian TikTok, with young people sharing their 'weight-loss journeys' and purchasing it online.

drug that went viral on Russian TikTok\n\nMolecule, a pill promising rapid weight loss, went viral on Russian TikTok earlier this year.\n\nYoung people's feeds started filling up with captions like \"Take Molecule and forget food exists\", and \"Do you want to sit in the back of the class in oversized clothes?\"\n\nClips showed fridges lined with blue boxes featuring holograms and \"Molecule Plus\" labels.\n\nThe orders began piling in, as teenagers shared their \"weight-loss journeys\" on social media.\n\nBut there was a catch.\n\nMaria, 22, had purchased the pill from a popular online retailer. She took two pills per day and, after two weeks, says her mouth dried up and she completely lost her appetite.\n\n\"I had absolutely no desire to eat, let alone drink. I was nervous. I was constantly biting my lips and chewing my cheeks.\"\n\nMaria developed severe anxiety and began having negative thoughts. \"These pills were having a profound effect on my psyche,\" she says.\n\nMaria, who lives in St Petersburg, says she wasn't prepared for such severe side effects.\n\nOther TikTok users mentioned dilated pupils, tremors and insomnia. And at least three schoolchildren are reported to have ended up in hospital.\n\nIn April, a schoolgirl in Chita, Siberia, needed hospital care after overdosing on Molecule. According to local reports, she was trying to lose weight quickly, in time for the summer.\n\nThe mother of another schoolgirl told local media her daughter was admitted to intensive care after taking several pills at once.\n\nAnd in May, a 13-year-old boy from St Petersburg needed hospital care after experiencing hallucinations and panic attacks. He had reportedly asked a friend to buy him the pill because he was being teased at school about his weight.\n\nThe packaging for Molecule pills often lists \"natural ingredients\" such as dandelion root and fennel seed extract.\n\nBut earlier this year, journalists at the Russian newspaper Izvestiya submitted pills they had purchased online for testing and found they contained a substance called sibutramine.\n\nFirst used as an antidepressant in the 1980s and later as an appetite suppressant, studies later found sibutramine increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes - while only slightly promoting weight loss.\n\nIt was banned in the US in 2010, and is also  illegal in the UK , EU, China and other countries.\n\nIn Russia, it is still used to treat obesity, but available only to adults and by prescription.\n\nPurchasing and selling sibutramine without a prescription is a criminal offence. But that hasn't stopped individuals and small businesses from selling it online - often in higher doses than legal medication - and without requiring prescriptions.\n\nThe unlicensed pills cost about £6-7 ($8-9) for a 20-day supply - much cheaper than recognised weight-loss injections like Ozempic, which on the Russian market sell for £40-160 ($50-210) per monthly pen.\n\n\"Self-administration of this drug is very unsafe,\" says endocrinologist Ksenia Solovieva from St Petersburg, warning of potential overdose risks, \"because we do not know how much of the active ingredient such 'dietary supplements' may contain\".\n\nRussians regularly receive prison sentences for purchasing and reselling Molecule pills. But it's proving difficult for authorities to get a grip on the drug being sold illegally.\n\nIn April, the government-backed Safe Internet League reported the growing trend involving young people to the authorities - prompting several major online marketplaces to remove Molecule from sale. But it soon began appearing online under a new name, Atom, in near-identical packaging.\n\nA law was recently passed allowing authorities to block websites selling \"unregistered dietary supplements\" without a court order - but sellers have been getting around this by categorising them as \"sports nutrition\" instead.\n\nOn TikTok, you can find retailers selling Molecule under listings that look like they are for muesli, biscuits and even lightbulbs. And some retailers aren't even trying to hide it any more.\n\nA few weeks ago, the BBC found Molecule listings on a popular Russian online marketplace. When approached for comment, the site said it had promptly removed any products containing sibutramine. But it admitted it was difficult to find and remove listings that didn't explicitly mention sibutramine.\n\nIf you do manage to get your hands on Molecule, it's hard to know exactly what you're getting - and it's unclear where the pills are being manufactured.\n\nThe BBC found some sellers with production certificates from factories in Guangzhou and Henan, in China. Others claim to be sourcing the pills from Germany.\n\nSome packets state they were produced in Remagen in Germany - but the BBC has discovered there is no such company listed at the address given.\n\nCertain Kazakh vendors selling Molecule to Russians told the BBC they bought stock from friends or warehouses in the capital Astana but couldn't name the original supplier.\n\nMeanwhile, online eating-disorder communities have become spaces where Molecule is promoted, with users relying on hashtags and coded terms to slip past moderation.\n\nMs Solovieva says Molecule is particularly harmful when taken by young people who already have eating disorders. For those in or near relapse, an easily available appetite suppressant can be seriously dangerous, she says.\n\nAnna Enina, a Russian influencer with millions of followers who herself has admitted using unlicensed weight-loss pills in the past, publicly warned her subscribers: \"As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder... the consequences will be dire. You'll regret it tenfold.\"\n\nTwenty-two-year old Maria suffered bad side effects, and is one of those who regrets it. After taking too many Molecule pills, she was sent to hospital.\n\nNow she discourages other young women and girls from taking the pills in weight-loss forums. She even reached out to one teenage user's parents to alert them.\n\nBut Molecule remains popular online.\n\nAnd every video that appears on Maria's TikTok feed is a reminder of the pills that made her sick."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjjdvx5r5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"03:49:34.973+00:00","title":"Zohran Mamdani - from rank outsider to possibly being New York's next mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Muslim and South Asian New York State Assemblyman, is poised to become the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, potentially the youngest in over a century.

mayor\n\nAs Zohran Mamdani walked the streets of the Upper East Side for a campaign event to greet early voters, he could barely walk a few steps without being stopped by his supporters.\n\nTwo smiling young women looked starstruck and told him they followed him on Instagram. The millennial Democratic nominee for mayor thanked them before posing with another young man who had readied his phone for a selfie.\n\nThrongs of press surrounded Mamdani and captured his every moment, like running into the street to shake hands with a taxi driver shouting \"we support you, man\".\n\nWith a comfortable lead in the polls, the 34-year-old is on the brink of making history when New Yorkers vote on Tuesday, as the youngest mayor in over a century and the first Muslim and South Asian leader of the city.\n\nA relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his rise, from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to New York State assembleyman and frontrunner to lead the biggest city in the US, a job which comes with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.\n\nThrough viral videos and outreach to content creators and podcasters, Mamdani has reached disaffected voters at a time when faith in the Democratic party among its own members is at an all-time low.\n\nBut there are questions over whether he can deliver on his ambitious promises and how a politician with no executive experience will handle the onslaught sure to come from a hostile Trump administration.\n\nThere is also the complicated relationship he has with his party establishment, as he becomes a national figurehead for left-wing Democrats.\n\nHe describes himself as a democratic socialist, which has no clear definition but essentially means giving a voice to workers, not corporations. He has promised to tax millionaires to pay for expanded social programmes. It's the politics of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with whom Mamdani has often shared a stage.\n\nTrump has threatened to withdraw federal funds if New Yorkers elect a \"communist\".\n\nMamdani has refuted that common attack line about his politics and during a daytime television interview he agreed with the host that he was \"kind of like a Scandinavian politician,\" only browner, he joked.\n\nVictory would be seen as a rejection of politics as usual by New Yorkers as they struggle with the cost of living - Mamdani's number one issue.\n\nHis main rival in Tuesday's vote is former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary.\n\nCuomo accuses Mamdani of an anti-business agenda that would kill New York. He says he has shown he can stand up to Trump but Mamdani calls Cuomo the president's puppet.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, mocks both of them. In the last debate, he said: \"Zohran, your resume could fit on a cocktail napkin. And Andrew, your failures could fill a public school library in New York City.\"\n\nMamdani's message has been laser-focused on affordability and quality of life issues. He has promised universal childcare, freezing rent in subsidised units, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.\n\nIt's a message that has landed with New Yorkers fed up with sky-high prices.\n\n\"I support him because I'm a housing attorney and I see how the cost of living just keeps going up and up and up,\" Miles Ashton told the BBC outside the candidates' debate earlier this month. \"We all want an affordable city.\"\n\nThe costs of the Mamdani agenda would be covered by new taxes on corporations and millionaires, which he insists would raise $9bn - though some, like the libertarian Cato Institute,  say his sums don't add up . He would also need the support of the state legislature and Governor Kathy Hochul to implement new taxes.\n\nShe has endorsed him but says she is against increased income taxes. She does, however, want to work with him to achieve universal child care, which is by far the biggest-ticket item on his agenda at $5bn.\n\nAs he rode the M57 bus across Manhattan to highlight his free buses plan, he told the BBC why his focus on affordability was the right approach in the Trump era.\n\n\"It's time for us to understand that to defend democracy, it's not just to stand up against an authoritarian administration. It is also to ensure that that democracy can deliver on the material needs of working class people right here. That's something we've failed to do in New York City.\"\n\nAmong New Yorkers who told the BBC they were not voting for Mamdani, doubts about him being able to pay for his agenda and his inexperience were two of the biggest factors.\n\nAfter Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June, Wall Street leaders were hardly celebrating. Some threatened to leave the city.\n\nBut there's been a noticeable shift since then - the mood is less panic, more collaboration. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon even said he would offer his help if Mamdani is elected.\n\nReal estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who has met Mamdani, says he is too inexperienced to lead the nation's largest city. He thinks his rent freeze plan would hurt tenants and his taxes on wealthy people will drive high earners away.\n\nHe does, however, support Mamdani's universal childcare plan, a provision he gives his own staff at his casino upstate.\n\nPart of the change in tone since the primary has been down to a concerted effort on Mamdani's part to meet his critics.\n\nOn 14 October, Alexis Bittar, a self-taught jewellery designer who grew his business into a global company, hosted Mamdani and 40 business leaders at his 1850s Brooklyn townhouse.\n\nThey were a mix of CEOs and business owners from financial, fashion and art sectors. More than half were Jewish and they were all either on the fence or opposed to Mamdani's candidacy.\n\nThere were questions about business, his management experience and how he would finance his agenda.\n\n\"I think he came across great,\" Mr Bittar told the BBC. \"The thing that's remarkable about him is he's incredibly equipped to answer them - and diligently answer them.\"\n\nPart of Mamdani's engagement with his critics has been a willingness to change his position.\n\nIn 2020, after the murder of black man George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, Mamdani called for the city to defund police and called the NYPD \"racist\". But he has since apologised and says he no longer holds those views.\n\nCrime is the number one issue for Howard Wolfson, who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and is now a Democratic strategist. He was present during a meeting last month between the mayoral hopeful and Bloomberg, who spent $8m during the primary race trying to beat him.\n\nWolfson told the BBC he will judge Mamdani on how the city is policed.\n\n\"I think it's great that he reaches out and is engaged, but I'm much more interested in how he's going to govern,\" he said. \"Public safety is really the prerequisite for success or failure.\"\n\nMany see Mamdani's pledge to ask the police commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on as a way to allay concerns he would be soft on crime.\n\nHe says he would maintain the current level of NYPD staffing and create a new department of community safety that would deploy mental health care teams instead of armed officers to non-threatening, psychiatric calls.\n\nOne position Mamdani has stood firm on is his criticism of Israel and lifelong support for Palestinian rights.\n\nIt represents a break from the Democratic party establishment and could be a deciding factor for many voters in a city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel.\n\nHe sparked outrage during the primary process when he refused to condemn the term \"globalise the intifada\". But after Jewish New Yorkers expressed their unease to him, telling him they felt unsafe on hearing it, he said he discouraged others from using it.\n\nA letter signed by more than 1,100 rabbis cited Mamdani as it condemned the \"political normalisation\" of anti-Zionism. Jewish voters are largely split between Mamdani and Cuomo in polling.\n\nBrad Lander, the city's comptroller, or financial chief, who teamed up with Mamdani in the Democratic primary to endorse each other's candidacy against Cuomo, says many Jewish New Yorkers like him are very enthusiastic about Mamdani.\n\nHe is a mayoral candidate deeply committed to keeping everyone safe, regardless of religious beliefs, Lander told the BBC.\n\nSumaiya Chowdhury and Farhana Islam of the group Muslims for Progress have canvassed for the mayoral hopeful.\n\nMs Islam said that, while they are all excited that he could be New York's first Muslim mayor, he doesn't need to lean on his identity for support.\n\n\"His policies speak for themselves and they alone are enough to make him popular.\"\n\nSince his primary win, the Islamophobia Mamdani faces has increased. He now has police security and, last month, a Texas man was arrested on charges of making terroristic threats against him. In one message, the man said \"Muslims don't belong here\".\n\nMamdani decided to deliver an address on Islamophobia after Cuomo laughed along to a radio talkshow host saying that Mamdani would cheer another 9/11-style attack.\n\nIn an emotional speech, he said he had hoped that by ignoring racist attacks and sticking to a central message, it would allow him to be more than just his faith. \"I was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.\"\n\nWhat may propel Mamdani to victory in liberal New York may not be a recipe for success nationally. And Democrats in Congress seem worried about the implications of his ascendancy as party tensions between moderates and progressives persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has not endorsed Mamdani, while his fellow New Yorker House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only endorsed him a few hours before early voting began.\n\nDemocratic strategists have said the problem posed by Mamdani for the party's establishment is that Trump and the Republicans already cast Democrats, no matter how moderate, as socialists. And it's a tactic that is thought to have landed with some effect among Cuban and Venezuelan voters in the 2024 election.\n\nJosh Gottheimer, the moderate Democratic representative of New Jersey,  told the Washington Post  he thought Mamdani had \"extremist views\" at odds with the Democratic party and that he feared Republicans will use the candidate as a kind of \"bogeyman\".\n\nAt a campaign event on the Upper East Side, Mamdani told the BBC how he plans to handle the intense scrutiny if he wins, pointing to the energy behind his candidacy.\n\n\"There is no doubt that there will be opposition as we see that opposition today, and what has allowed us to surmount the unbelievable amounts of money that has been spent against this campaign in the primary or the general, has been the mass movement that we have created.\"\n\nPaloma Nadera, 38, volunteering at the event, said the last time she had been this excited to vote had been for Barack Obama in 2008. Since then she's been disappointed by what she called the lack of bravery within the party.\n\n\"I feel like this race means so much to me because it's local. It's going to affect me, my family, my friends, everyone here in New York City.\n\n\"But it's also sort of sending a message, up the chain about what we want politics to start to look like on the Democratic side on a national level.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv11w8ez10o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"16:11:31.254+00:00","title":"Aid struggles to reach Jamaican towns devastated by hurricane","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five days after Hurricane Melissa, a category five storm with 185 mph winds, devastated western Jamaica, particularly affecting Westmoreland and St Elizabeth parishes, where homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods were destroyed.

by hurricane\n\nFive days after Hurricane Melissa pummelled into western Jamaica with record force, residents in devastated communities along the coast are still desperately waiting for help.\n\nMany of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return.\n\nThe government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds.\n\nThat is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days.\n\nLocal official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland.\n\nWestmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elisabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.\n\nA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history.\n\nPiles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction.\n\nOn Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill.\n\nA policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic.\n\n\"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".\n\nThose living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating.\n\nGary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\".\n\nHe sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next.\n\nWilliams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch.\n\nAnother woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"\n\nAbout 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world.\n\nJamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet.\n\nHe addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays.\n\n\"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X.\n\nJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies.\n\nBut that would only solve part of the problem.\n\nIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood.\n\n\"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\".\n\n\"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\".\n\nMorris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\".\n\n\"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish.\n\nEven then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch.\n\nThe people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances.\n\nSeated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".\n\n\"Can't give up. Not gonna give up,\" he said.\n\nIt is the same tone struck by Oreth Jones, a farmer sitting in the bed of his truck selling pears, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes – the last of his produce that was spared from the storm.\n\nOf his farm, he said: \"It's all wrecked. They all destroyed.\" But he quickly followed up with: \"We have to give God thanks we're alive.\"\n\nJones survived the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history while he was injured, wearing a homemade splint on his right leg from a fracture he suffered during a biking accident before Melissa hit.\n\nWhen asked about how the community will move forward, he said: \"Pray. Nothing else we can do. Nothing else.\"\n\nMeanwhile, foreign aid has now started entering into Jamaica.\n\nThe US State Department announced on Friday that its Disaster Assistance Response Team had arrived. And countries including the UK have also pledged millions in aid relief funds and emergency supplies."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz8de5p57o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"01:52:56.119+00:00","title":"Football Manager has finally added women's teams - I put the game to the test","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Football Manager 26, set for release on 4 November 2025, marks a radical transformation of the long-running franchise, featuring women's football with 40,000 players from 14 leagues, a completely redesigned user interface, and a new tactics system allowing dual strategies.

finally added women's teams - I put the game to the test\n\nThe most recent edition of the Football Manager game was played by a mind-blowing 20 million people.\n\nBut last year a new game wasn't released, for the first time in its 20-year history.\n\nThat's due to significant delays as its studio, Sports Interactive, made massive changes to refresh the series.\n\nUsually, minor tweaks and features are added in new versions.\n\nBut what's coming in Football Manager 26 - when it finally releases on 4 November - is closer to a complete rewrite of everything that came before.\n\nSome of the new features are ambitious, to say the least.\n\nIt will be the first game ever to feature women's football, including around 40,000 players from 14 leagues.\n\nAnd the user interface - the system you click through to sign players, read news and get to the football - has been remade.\n\nEssentially, it is no minor update.\n\n\"This isn't a continuation,\" series boss Miles Jacobson told me. \"This is a new game - the start of the next 20 years.\"\n\nHe even admitted it wasn't perfect, and said fixes would be needed.\n\nAnd let's be blunt - as the public beta test nears its end, there are a lot of people online who are frankly furious with many of these changes.\n\n\"The user interface sucks,\" reads one angry comment. \"They ruined my favourite game,\" reads another.\n\n\"New leadership is needed,\" reads a third.\n\nSpeaking of the leadership, Jacobson accepted this game could impact his future at the studio.\n\nAfter last year's cancellation, he told me Football Manager 26 simply needed to be a hit.\n\n\"You live and die by your decisions,\" he said. \"If it was the wrong decision then I'm not going to be here in a year's time.\"\n\nSo what is it - a bold new step for one of the best-selling gaming franchises in history, or a colossal misfire akin to Ange Postecoglou's 39-day stint in charge of Nottingham Forest?\n\nFans of women's football will be relieved to know this is no half-measure.\n\nI played through a few seasons as Liverpool in the Women's Super League and was pleasantly surprised by just how well-integrated women are into the game.\n\n\"It's been four years of sweat and tears,\" Sports Interactive's head of women's football research Tina Keech told me.\n\n\"This is the biggest database in women's football in video games. We've had to go out and do some real hard work to find this accurate data.\"\n\nShe explained getting the stats of individual players' careers isn't as simple as Googling it - back in the day, clubs weren't so diligent about keeping records.\n\nBut Football Manager, of course, is not just a database.\n\nOn the pitch, it benefits from new graphics, based on work with women's footballers in the motion capture studio, and a perhaps unlikely source: VAR.\n\nPlayers' movements in real life have been captured by the tech and turned into animations in the game.\n\nWomen's football provides its own unique challenges to the series.\n\nLike in the real world, budgets are much tighter even for the top teams, so you need to be more careful how you spend your money.\n\nFor example, I mindlessly appealed against a failed work permit application to sign an international player - an irrelevant sum to a top men's team - only to discover this had wiped out a solid chunk of my transfer budget.\n\nIt all felt like playing Football Manager on hard mode, which was a welcome challenge.\n\nBut for those of us looking for a way to make the game a bit easier, Keech gave us the inside track on the game's first ever female wonderkids - young footballers who haven't yet hit the big time but who have significant potential.\n\nShe told me about two players in particular who can be signed immediately and have the potential to become star players - as long as you have the money.\n\n\"Felicia Schröder, I think there were quite a few WSL [Women's Super League] clubs looking at her in the summer, she's out in Sweden, scoring goals for fun,\" Keech said. \"And then Trinity Armstrong, who's out in the US and is supposed to be a really impressive centre-back.\"\n\nIt's the football matches themselves which have faced the biggest changes.\n\nIn previous versions, you didn't have much to do between watching the highlights. You could follow the text at the bottom of the screen, but most people just twiddled their thumbs and waited.\n\nBut that's all changed - now, you see a small visual representation of what's happening with dots on a screen, harking back to how the game looked in the 00s.\n\nVisually, it's lots of fun, with new camera angles which better reflect how football plays out on the telly.\n\nAnother massive new feature - and I appreciate this one is really for the football nerds out there - is an overhaul of the tactics system.\n\nPreviously you would have one tactic and individual instructions for players. Now, you can set two different tactics at once - one for when your team has the ball, and one for when they don't.\n\nThese completely change the match experience for the better, and coupled with the new graphics, it's fair to say football has never been so much fun in Football Manager.\n\nI'll even admit to clapping my hands and spinning in my chair with excitement when Fūka Nagano blasted in a piledriver from 35 yards - which led to a bunch of staff at the studio gathering around to watch the replay.\n\nBut for all the bits that work, there are problems too. The game sometimes felt unfinished.\n\nI played a work-in-progress version of the game when I visited Sports Interactive in October, and since then, I've been playing a \"beta\" version. So it's possible some of these issues may be addressed by the time the game comes out.\n\nThe user interface has been the focus of dissent online, and not without good reason. When it works, it's great - but when you can't figure out how to do something, it's a chore.\n\nFans will say the old user interface had its problems, but we all knew how to use it - so why change it?\n\nThen there were the bugs. At various times, information displayed incorrectly, menus didn't pop up when I clicked on them, and once a player even seemed to forget to wear their kit in a match and played in a tracksuit instead.\n\nFor a lot of people, these aren't deal-breakers, and some may even sound quite petty.\n\nBut I'm only listing a few of the problems I encountered. There's no real excuse for all of the problems this close to the game's full release.\n\nAfter playing the game for quite a few hours, I was torn.\n\nYou have to reward the studio for the ambition. The matches are great, and women's football is an excellent addition.\n\nBut you can't manage national teams for men or women, only club teams, which seems ridiculous after England goalie Hannah Hampton's heroics this summer - though I've had it confirmed this will be added later as a free update.\n\nAnd on that point, the studio confirmed to me there will be only one paid extra, an editor that lets you change player's stats. There will be no flood of micro-transactions or season passes, as has become common elsewhere in the gaming industry.\n\nBut there are glaring bugs. As someone who's been playing since 2004, it's clear to me the user interface needs many more months of work.\n\nUltimately, the thing fans will want to know is: can you still be hooked by the new version of a game so addictive it has reportedly been cited in multiple divorce cases?\n\nAs I enter my fourth season in charge of Liverpool, following a genuinely devastating 1-0 defeat in the Uefa Women's Champions League final to Arsenal courtesy of a late Alessia Russo goal, my answer probably becomes fairly obvious.\n\nAll the changes take some getting used to, but that desire for just \"one more match\" hasn't gone away.\n\nDoes that mean you should get it? I don't know. But I do think the early social media critics should remember one thing that's been a fact of football for decades.\n\nFans calling for the manager to be sacked should often be careful what they wish for."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kp19ed78wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"08:20:00.918+00:00","title":"I blew the whistle on a massive tax fraud - and they sued me","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jas Bains, a former head lawyer at Solo Capital, exposed a massive tax fraud involving the cum-ex trade targeting Denmark, where funds were siphoned through manipulated dividend transactions.

met at airports in 20-foot limousines, and taken to places like the Atlantis hotel in Dubai or the Singapore Grand Prix. There'd be a hundred grand spent in the bar.\"\n\nIn 2013, Jas Bains was an ambitious young lawyer, enjoying the high life that came with working for an extremely profitable City hedge fund.\n\nToday, he is jobless and has lost most of his wealth, having spent years fighting legal battles and attempting to clear his name of association with a huge tax scam.\n\nThe irony, he says, is that he blew the whistle on the scam in the first place – only to find himself one of the targets of a £1.4bn lawsuit.\n\nHe is reflecting one month after  the case ended,  bringing to a close eight years of legal arguments and one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK.\n\nThe Danish tax authority was left licking its wounds, after failing to establish that a large group of defendants, including Mr Bains, were liable for huge losses it had suffered.\n\nIt all began in 2009, when a banker named Sanjay Shah established a London-based hedge fund called Solo Capital. It also had offices in Dubai. It was one of a network of funds, banks and legal outfits that were to become heavily implicated in  the so-called cum-ex trade.\n\nThis focused on transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend).\n\nThose involved exploited delays in processing the sale to create confusion over who actually owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. This tactic allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued.\n\nFrom the outside, it was complicated, but for those involved it led to ever bigger and more elaborate trades which ultimately cost taxpayers across Europe billions.\n\nIt initially became popular in Germany, before spreading to other countries including France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Solo Capital targeted Denmark, with the bulk of its cum-ex trades taking place from 2013 onwards.\n\nJas Bains joined the company in 2010, as its head lawyer, but went on to run the London office. At the time, Solo was \"a successful firm, making money in five or six different areas pretty well\".\n\nAnd making money meant enjoying the high life, with staff going on sprees to places like Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\n\n\"What I will say about Sanjay is he knew how to throw a party,\" he says.\n\n\"One time we were in the Ku De Ta club at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. He bought 20 bottles of vintage Dom Perignon champagne, and people were just spraying each other with the stuff.\n\n\"People have likened it to Wolf of Wall Street and such like.\"\n\nIt didn't end there. \"Sanjay organised private concerts in Dubai with Prince. A small room with him and his friends at three or four million dollars for an evening ... private concerts with Snoop Dogg.\"\n\nBy mid-2014, however, Mr Bains had fallen out with his boss and left the company for a competitor. At the time, the cum-ex transactions targeting Denmark were dramatically picking up.\n\n\"I was hearing from people who'd left Solo that Sanjay was doing some big trades in 2014, but look, I'd moved on, it didn't have much to do with me,\" he says.\n\n\"But then I heard, actually Sanjay made close to €100m in trades from Denmark in 2013, closer to €250m in 2014 and he was looking for a billion in 2015.\"\n\nAlarm bells were ringing.\n\n\"I thought this can't be right. It's not that I thought the trades were invalid or criminal in some way. It's just any country that has a billion Euros syphoned off it will scream bloody murder.\"\n\nSolo Capital wasn't the only company now targeting Denmark. Others were getting in on the act. Jas believed it was only a matter of time before the house of cards came tumbling down.\n\n\"I was quite confident I'd done nothing wrong, but I knew if this carried on and blew up in spectacular style, I was going to get pulled in,\" he explains.\n\nWith that in mind, in 2015, he decided to blow the whistle.\n\nHe contacted a Danish lawyer, who in turn put him in touch with the Danish police. He went on to spend two and a half years assisting them with understanding how the cum-ex scam worked.\n\nDanish prosecutors did not target Mr Bains. Their attention was focused firmly on Mr Shah. The 54-year-old was eventually extradited from Dubai to face fraud charges – and in December last year was  sentenced to 12 years in jail .\n\nIt was the heaviest penalty ever handed out in Denmark for a fraud case. He is currently appealing.\n\nBut when the Danish tax authority, Skatteforvaltningen (Skat), launched its huge case, seeking to recover its lost money, Mr Bains was one of the more than 100 individual and corporate defendants initially targeted - alongside Mr Shah.\n\nWith that lawsuit hanging over him it became out of the question for him to work as a lawyer, or to get a role in the City of London.\n\n\"It's impossible to get a job if you're being sued as part of a two billion dollar international tax fraud case,\" he says.\n\nHowever, in October, High court judge Mr Justice Andrew Baker threw out Skat's claims.\n\nAcknowledging that \"greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here\", he nevertheless concluded that Skat has failed to prove it was a victim of deception.\n\nThe authority's \"controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be non-existent,\" he said.\n\nThat seemed to echo a statement previously made by Mr Shah in a 2021 German TV interview, which was also cited in the ruling:\n\n\"Why would they pay out for years and years and then, after four years of payments they say, 'Oh, we made a mistake, or we were cheated'\", he said.\n\n\"If there's a big sign on the street saying 'please help yourself', then me or somebody else would go and help themselves.\"\n\nThere may still be an appeal. But for Mr Bains, the ruling provided some much-needed closure – and, he says, a chance to move on."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62065ynx5xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:43:30.996+00:00","title":"Pregnant Bella Culley 'toasts bread over a candle flame' in Georgian prison","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bella Culley, a 19-year-old British teenager, is currently imprisoned in Georgia after being charged with smuggling 12kg of marijuana and 2kg of hashish in her luggage at Tbilisi International Airport.

Culley 'toasts bread over a candle flame' in Georgian prison\n\nA British teenager - eight months pregnant and charged with drugs smuggling - is awaiting sentencing in prison in Georgia, South Caucasus. A payment of £137,000 by her family will reduce her sentence but what are the days like for Bella Culley, incarcerated 2,600 miles (4,180km) from home?\n\nSpeaking exclusively to the BBC, Bella Culley's mother reveals her daughter - now 35 weeks pregnant - has been transferred to a prison \"mother and baby\" unit.\n\nThis marks a significant change for the 19-year-old after five months in a cell in Georgia's Rustavi Prison Number Five, with only a hole in the ground for a toilet, one hour of fresh air daily, and communal showers twice a week.\n\nLyanne Kennedy says her daughter has been boiling pasta in a kettle and toasting bread over a candle flame but is now allowed to cook for herself and other women and children in the unit, and is learning Georgian.\n\n\"She now gets two hours out for walking, she can use the communal kitchen, has a shower in her room and a proper toilet,\" she says, describing the improved conditions since a transfer earlier this month.\n\n\"They all cook for each other,\" Ms Kennedy says. \"Bella has been making eggy bread and cheese toasties, and salt and pepper chicken.\"\n\nMiss Culley has been held in pre-trial detention since May, after police discovered 12kg (26lb) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lb) of hashish in her hold luggage at Tbilisi International Airport.\n\nSome accounts from inside the jail paint a stark picture of conditions.\n\nIn September, Georgian media widely published an open letter they said had been sent from prison by Anastasia Zinovkina, a Russian political activist sentenced to eight-and-a-half years on drug possession charges.\n\nMs Zinovkina, who insisted the drugs were planted on her, described the sanitary conditions as \"appalling\" and \"horrific\".\n\n\"One single bar of soap is used to wash hair, body, socks, underwear, and dishes,\" she wrote. \"If the soap runs out before the guards decide to give out a new one (which happens once every three months) then they simply don't wash.\n\n\"Toilet paper is provided once monthly, and only to those with no money on their prison account. Showering is permitted only twice weekly - on Wednesdays and Sundays - for 15 minutes.\n\n\"The girls who don't have slippers bathe barefoot or use shared slippers. They get fungal infections and pass them to each other.\"\n\nThe Georgian Ministry of Justice told the BBC in May that conditions in the prison had significantly improved since earlier monitoring reports by the Georgian Public Defender.\n\nUnder Georgia's new penitentiary code, which came into force in January last year, inmates \"have the right to fresh air at least one hour on a daily basis\", it said.\n\nIt also highlighted various reforms, including vocational education programmes, a digital university for distance learning, and improved healthcare through an online clinic.\n\n\"Georgian authorities put human-centered approach at the heart of the penitentiary reform to ensure the healthy management of prison system,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe ministry also said the UN sub-committee on prevention of torture visited the prison in October 2023 and \"did not express any concerns regarding the prison conditions, sanitary or issues related to out-of-cell activities/contact with outside world\".\n\nThe committee's report is confidential but the UN said at the time it encouraged the Georgian government to make it public.\n\nThe case has drawn attention to Georgia's strict approach to drug-related offences and its extensive use of \"plea bargaining\" to resolve criminal cases.\n\nGuram Imnadze, a criminal justice lawyer and drug policy expert based in Tbilisi, says in 2024 nearly 90% of drug-related crimes in Georgia were resolved in this way.\n\n\"Sentences are so severe that plea bargaining is in both sides' interests,\" Mr Imnadze explains. \"The main strategy from a defence perspective is to have plea bargaining as fast as possible.\"\n\nEarlier agreements typically result in softer conditions, with lower sentences and fines, he says.\n\nFor trafficking involving large amounts of drugs, Georgian law provides for sentences of up to 20 years or life imprisonment. Mr Imnadze says Miss Culley's case coincided with a new interior minister taking office, who made drug crimes a priority.\n\n\"What they want is to show the public right now what tangible results they have, and 12kg of marijuana is already a huge amount for public perception,\" he says.\n\nMiss Culley claimed she had been tortured and forced to carry the drugs but was warned she was facing 20 years in prison. But, for a \"substantial sum\", she could be released, she was told.\n\nBack in Tbilisi City Court last Tuesday, the teenager heard her family had managed to raise £137,000. Not the amount needed for her to walk free but enough to reduce her sentence significantly, to two years. She is due in court again on Monday to hear her final sentence.\n\nMs Kennedy says the family is doing everything they can to get her home \"where she should be\".\n\nMiss Culley's lawyer, Malkhaz Salakaia, has previously said that, once an agreement was reached, he would appeal to the President of Georgia to pardon the British teenager.\n\nMr Salakaia confirmed Miss Culley had pleaded guilty to bringing drugs into the country, flying from Thailand via Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, but said she was made to do so by gangsters who tortured her with hot iron.\n\nGeorgian police had launched a separate criminal investigation into her coercion allegations, he said.\n\nWhen the teenager landed in Tbilisi on 10 May, her luggage was immediately flagged by Georgian authorities and, although she attempted to explain to police that someone was supposed to meet her at the arrivals hall, they did not follow this up and charged her, he said.\n\nMr Salakaia says there is a provision in Georgian law for pregnant women, raising the family's hopes that the teenager could be released before giving birth.\n\n\"It is written in the law that when a child is born, the mother must be outside until the child is one year old,\" he says.\n\nMs Kennedy, who has been traveling back and forth between the UK and Georgia, says her daughter is getting on well with staff and prisoners and she had been able to take in baby clothes for her.\n\nHer daughter's full story \"will come in time\", she says.\n\n\"Until then we are just a family doing everything we can for my daughter and grandson.\"\n\nFollow BBC Tees on  X,   Facebook ,  Nextdoor  and  Instagram ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm277455158o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"16:46:12.204+00:00","title":"Delays at US airports as staff absences surge, aviation agency says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A surge in air traffic controller absences has caused significant delays and cancellations at major US airports, with half of the nation’s 30 largest airports affected.

salon in Walsall.\n\nBorn in nearby Wolverhampton, she is an established business owner and proud mum.\n\nBut she's also one of several Asian women in the West Midlands who tell the BBC they're now constantly looking over their shoulder. And she's terrified about her daughter leaving the house.\n\nThat's because within the space of two months and taking place only 10 miles (16km) apart, police have received reports of two racially aggravated rapes.\n\nEarly on 9 September, a Sikh woman in her 20s was raped on Tame Road in Oldbury.\n\nAnd on the evening of 25 October in the Park Hall area of Walsall, another Sikh woman who is also in her 20s was raped. A  32-year-old man named John Ashby has been charged .\n\nIn both cases perpetrators were unknown to their victims.\n\nAnother woman was assaulted with an  electrical stun device in Wolverhampton  on 27 October in what police said was a racially aggravated physical - but not sexual - assault.\n\nSukhvinder Kaur, the chair of trustees at Sikh Women's Aid, says the charity's helpline has been receiving more calls than usual from women who are fearful.\n\nOne woman, a single mother from Walsall with three daughters, asked the charity for a grant because she was worried about her daughters walking to school, as their route included the road where the Walsall attack occurred.\n\nMs Kaur said: \"There is a real sense of fear now - this isn't far-right narratives on the TV, it's not a social media thing, it is now coming on to our streets.\"\n\nWest Midlands Police said making the area \"a safer place for our communities, particularly women and girls is our priority\".\n\nThe force added it had also linked up with \"women's charities, female community leaders, community safety partners, independent advisory groups and local politicians to discuss women's safety\".\n\nSpeaking after  charges were brought in the case of the Walsall attack  last week, Ch Supt Phil Dolby said the force understood \"the fear and concern this attack has caused in our communities\".\n\nWe spoke to Asian women of different faiths in Birmingham and the Black Country who voiced concerns for their safety. Some said they had previously felt safe living here but were now scared of leaving their homes, or even being in the house alone.\n\nShabnam Ansari, a Muslim woman from Dudley, said: \"I wear a hijab so I've always been aware that I might be a victim of racism.\n\n\"But what happened in Oldbury and Walsall makes me feel like being brown is enough of a target to be physically and sexually abused.\"\n\nJazzy Kular, a 51-year-old teacher from Birmingham, said the rapes had made her afraid to open the door to strangers.\n\nCouncil worker Kavita Masawala, 41, from South Birmingham, added: \"As an Asian woman born and raised in Birmingham, hearing about these rapes is heartbreaking.\n\n\"We're in 2025 and still having to watch over our backs and be worried about our skin colour.\n\n\"I now have to think twice before going for a walk.\"\n\nMahsooma, a mother from Birmingham who didn't give her surname, visits Walsall's play areas and said she was unsure if she could take her children any more.\n\n\"I've never felt this way before,\" she said.\n\nBeauty salon owner Ravita has a global following of almost 30,000 on Instagram - of which many are Sikh women in the USA, Canada and Dubai.\n\n\"I've had followers from abroad reach out who can't believe what's happening,\" she said. \"[They feel] that sense of tension and stress and anxiety for their sisters here in the UK.\"\n\nAt home, the 45-year-old is scared for the safety of her daughter, who is about the same age as the victims in Walsall and Oldbury.\n\n\"We've said to our daughter: no more buses, we will pick you up from work,\" Ravita said.\n\nBut she wants to get the balance right as she is cautious of exerting too much control over her child. The recent incidents make her worry that some Asian households will get too strict with their daughters.\n\n\"As a mum, do I want my daughter out and about [right now]? Hell no,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd love to just wrap her up in cotton wool and keep her close, but we can't do that either because she has a life to live and rightfully should be able to do so.\"\n\nWhile women are considering how safe they feel on the streets and in their own homes, community organisations are debating whether to hand out rape alarms.\n\nSukhvinder Kaur says women have been feeling they have to recalibrate their entire lives and personal freedoms.\n\nDetails of help and support with sexual violence are available at  BBC Action Line .\n\nFollow BBC Birmingham on  BBC Sounds ,  Facebook ,  X  and  Instagram ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvvg337x8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"15:07:22.856+00:00","title":"What have eyewitnesses said about Huntingdon train stabbings?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eyewitnesses reported a violent mass stabbing on a LNER train traveling from Doncaster to London King's Cross, which made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire shortly before 20:00 GMT.

train stabbings?\n\nPassengers have described blood-covered seats and attempting to protect themselves with a bottle after a mass stabbing on a LNER train left 11 people injured and needing hospital treatment. Two remain in a life-threatening condition.\n\nPolice met the Doncaster-London King's Cross train as it made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire shortly before 20:00 GMT.\n\nAlistair Day, who was travelling back to Hertford having watched Nottingham Forest, was on the train when the attack happened - having narrowly missed his original connecting service.\n\nHe joined others and hid in the train's buffet carriage as a fellow passenger confronted a man with a knife.\n\n\"I was just by the buffet car. It was odd. I was at the end of the carriage. All these kids were running up and I thought it was like a prank - Halloween or students,\" he said.\n\n\"Then they're getting louder and louder any sorts of people with blood on them [appeared] and I thought, 'Oh, bloody hell, this is not good.'\n\n\"I saw a guy flailing out - a fracas with arms going everywhere. I didn't see him that well because there were people in front of him.\n\n\"My initial thought was I'm going to sit there and try and do something but I changed my mind.\n\n\"We all jumped up and everyone kept running but I was next to the buffet car and the guys in the carriage were trying to close up the shutters and everything.\n\n\"So I said, no, you've got to let us in here. So I jumped in there - there were about 12 of us in there.\n\n\"I was the first one in, so I was in the corner. A young woman who I spoke to afterwards was by the window and the guy was at the window with his knife trying to get in. Obviously we'd locked it by then.\"\n\nJoe, who was also travelling back from the  Nottingham Forest v Manchester United match , said the scenes were \"like something out of a movie\".\n\nThe 24-year-old, from Peckham in south-east London, said: \"I was texting my friends about my plans for that night and then people came rushing through from the carriage, running through, saying, 'You need to run, you need to run'.\n\n\"At first it didn't really register what was going on.\n\n\"And then quickly, I just dropped my stuff and I started running along with them.\n\n\"And then I looked back, and I could see this guy - he was quite a tall, black male, and he had a bloodied knife.\n\n\"You just looked around and there was blood just everywhere.\"\n\nJoe continued: \"We kept moving through the train. We could see him behind us coming through.\n\n\"The scariest thing was that I knew that because the stops at this stage of the journey are just Stevenage and King's Cross there's quite a lot of big distances between stops.\n\n\"So we had no idea how long we were going to be on the train for.\n\n\"The thing that was in my mind was we're running through this train now but what if we run out of carriages to run through? What if we reach the end of the train? What happens there?\n\n\"It all happened very quickly. I was just in a fight or flight mode really.\"\n\nSteve was on the King's Cross-bound train with his two children. The family were at the opposite end of the train to where the attack unfolded, but reflected on a \"nightmare scenario\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: \"We got on it [the train] about 19:10. We had just departed Peterborough, and then kind of an alarm went off, a kind of a soft alarm went off, which I heard before on the train.\n\n\"It said that, you know, an activation alarm has been activated in coach J.\n\n\"I didn't know what it was, but then we suddenly started seeing people massing at the end of the carriage by the door... I wasn't really sure what was going on.\n\n\"And then people started to get panicky.\n\n\"Someone said, there's been a stabbing. And then people started to move quite quickly down towards our carriage.\"\n\nHe continued: \"A woman came over the tannoy and said, 'we are aware there is an incident. Just keep yourself safe', which was scary to hear, because you didn't know what was going on.\n\n\"Then we pulled into a station. I think everybody assumed it was Stevenage, because that was the next scheduled stop.\n\n\"Everyone just started to kind of run and then pile off the train, and then everyone just, there's a bit of a panic, and everyone ran through the station forecourt.\n\n\"We ran out into the car park and ran up a hill and kind of out on to the road, and then we bumped into two or three young girls.\n\n\"We ran to someone's house, and we hammered on all the doors and pressed the buzzers, and we got in, and some very kind, early-elderly couple looked after us until it was safe to leave.\n\n\"The kids are very shaken up by it, but dealing with it very well.\"\n\nOlly Foster, a passenger on the train, told the BBC he initially heard people shouting \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone\", and believed it might have been a Halloween related prank.\n\nHe said within minutes, people started pushing through the carriage, and he noticed his hand was \"covered in blood\" as there was \"blood all over the chair\" he had leaned on.\n\nAn older man \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl, leaving him with a gash on his head and neck, Mr Foster said.\n\nPassengers around him used jackets to try to staunch the bleeding.\n\nHe added that the only thing people in his carriage could use against the attacker was a bottle of whiskey, leaving them \"staring down the carriage\" and \"praying\" that he would not enter the carriage.\n\nAlthough it lasted 10-15 minutes in total, Mr Foster says the incident \"felt like forever\".\n\nDescribing the scene when he got off the train, he said: \"There were three people bleeding severely. One guy was holding his stomach and there's blood coming from his stomach and going down his leg.\n\n\"He was going 'help, help, I've been stabbed'.\"\n\nThe train's only other scheduled stop before King's Cross was due to be at Stevenage.\n\nWren Chambers, who was due to get off in the Hertfordshire town, said they first became aware something was wrong when a man bolted down the carriage with a bloody arm, saying \"they've got a knife, run\".\n\nWren said they and a friend ran to the front of the train and saw a man who had collapsed on the floor.\n\nWren said they felt \"stressed and pretty scared\" once they knew what was happening, but they were eventually able to get off the train unharmed.\n\n\"There was quite a lot of blood on the train, there was some on my bag, some on my jeans,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"As soon as the train stopped and people got off most of them ran outside trying to get away from it, because we knew the attacker was still inside on the train.\"\n\nLondon Underground worker Dean McFarlane told the BBC that he saw the train pull into Huntingdon railway station at 20:00 with a passenger bleeding.\n\nHe said that on arrival, he saw multiple people running down the platform bleeding, with one man in a white shirt \"completely covered in blood\".\n\nHe said he grabbed people and told them to leave the station, and tried to assist passengers who he believed were having panic attacks.\n\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on  BBC Sounds ,  Facebook ,  Instagram  and  X ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0066ew7lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"23:44:10.043+00:00","title":"Trump remodels Lincoln bathroom in latest White House renovation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has unveiled a new bathroom renovation in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House, claiming it is historically appropriate with black and white marble and gold fixtures, in contrast to the 1940s art deco green tiles previously installed.

has unveiled renovations to the bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom, as his remodelling of the White House continues.\n\nTrump shared photos of the new bathroom on social media, saying it had been \"renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era\".\n\nHe claimed the new black and white marble is \"very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\".\n\nIt is the latest change Trump has made to the White House this year. In October, its East Wing was demolished to make way for his new multi-million dollar ballroom.\n\nThe bathroom is a part of Abraham Lincoln's office and cabinet room, which former President Harry Truman fixed up as a part of his massive renovation of the White House in the late 1940s.\n\nThe wallpaper of Lincoln's office and bedroom was once coloured in green and gold, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nAfter Trump's remodelling, it now features gold fixtures and accents for the sink, bathtub faucet and shower door, as well as a chandelier.\n\nThe White House said the renovation was privately funded at no cost to the taxpayer.\n\nThe US president's attempts to put his own stamp on the White House have prompted criticism from conservation groups and his political opponents.\n\nTrump previously said his ballroom addition to the East Wing would not \"interfere with the current building\". But in October, he said the \"existing structure\" had to be torn down.\n\nTrump said the ballroom construction was being fully funded by him and \"some friends of mine - donors\".\n\nConservationists argued Trump should have sought public review before making the changes, which they say would overwhelm the classical style of the White House.\n\nThe White House hit back at its critics, saying \"unhinged leftists\" were \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House - a bold, necessary addition\".\n\nOther changes to the White House include his decision in August to pave over grass in the Rose Garden with stone, transforming a lawn into a patio.\n\nTrump also added touches of gilded gold all over the Oval Office, including additional portraits framed in gold, gold-framed mirrors and a gold leaf for the presidential seal on the ceiling of the office.\n\nIn response to his latest bathroom renovation, the Democrats accused Trump of being more focused on remaking the White House than solving the government shutdown.\n\nCentral to the shutdown, which is now entering its second month, is a dispute over whether to extend health insurance subsidies.\n\n\"Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,\" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a post on social media.\n\nSpeaking at an event on Saturday, former US President Barack Obama said Trump has been \"focused on critical issues, like paving over the Rose Garden so folks don't get mud on their shoes and gold plating the Oval Office and building a $300m ballroom\" than resolving the shutdown.\n\n\"If you can't visit a doctor, don't worry. He will save you a dance,\" he added."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8675l25591o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:23:33.377+00:00","title":"Andrew to be stripped of his final military title by King, minister says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK government is removing Andrew Mountbatten Windsor's final military title, Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, at the request of King Charles III.

decades after playing the lead in Oliver! at the London Palladium.\n\nAs for Paddington: The Musical's star, Tom first met him two years ago.\n\nThe bear's design and technology waited in the wings while the cast and production were pulled together around it.\n\n\"You never forget when you first meet Paddington,\" Tom says, echoing a sentiment almost everyone involved tells Newsbeat with a

WW1 Bedfordshire soldiers’ graves identified in Belgium\n\nTwo British soldiers have been commemorated more than a century after they were killed fighting in World War One.\n\nThe graves of second lieutenants Esmond Kellie and Eric Hopkins of the Bedfordshire Regiment were recently identified by the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) \"War Detectives\" team.\n\nThe men both died in 1915 during the battle for Hill 60 near Ypres in Belgium, and were buried as unknown officers of the Bedfordshire Regiment after being identified by their uniforms.\n\nServices of re-dedication were held at Ypres, supported by serving soldiers from the Royal Anglian Regiment and attended by the men's relatives.\n\nAlexia Clark is a commemorations case worker at the MOD's Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre.\n\nShe attended both services in Ypres and said \"they are always really emotional occasions – although it's difficult to pin down the emotion\".\n\n\"It's the closest the families will ever get to a funeral, but at the same time we're closing the chapter on someone who's been missing for 110 years.\n\n\"It's sad but also joyful.\"\n\n2nd Lt Kellie was transferred to the 1st Bedfordshire Regiment in 1915.\n\nOn 19 April 1915 he was injured in the thigh while defending a trench at Hill 60, but was killed by a shell while being stretchered away.\n\nA letter sent home to his parents by Lt Col Griffith DSO described him as a \"most courageous and useful officer... very popular with all in the regiment\".\n\n2nd Lt Kellie was buried on Hill 60, but later moved to Railway Dugouts burial ground in West Flanders.\n\n2nd Lt Hopkins arrived in France in October 1914 and moved between battalions of the Bedfordshire Regiment.\n\nAt the time of his death in May 1915 he was attached to the 1st Battalion, who were engaged in the struggle for Hill 60.\n\nIn 1922, an unknown British Officer of the Bedfordshire Regiment was reburied at Bedford House cemetery.\n\n\"In the ensuing 110 years, they have lain as unknown officers,\" said Ms Clark.\n\nShe said members of the public had carried out research about who was buried in the graves, and submitted the details to the MOD.\n\nThe MOD then worked with the  Commonwealth War Graves Commission  (CWGC) to replace the headstone and arrange a service.\n\nDaniel Seaton, of the CWGC, said: \"It is always moving to be able to transfer a name from one of the Commission's Memorials to the Missing to a named grave in our care.\n\n\"More than a century after their deaths, this has now been possible for 2nd Lts Kellie and Hopkins, whose final resting places will continue to be tended to by the commission.\"\n\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on  BBC Sounds ,  Facebook ,  Instagram  and  X

Maybe some cookies for her grandchildren.\n\nBut on this Saturday, with the future of her federal food assistance benefits clouded by uncertainty, she moved cautiously through the store, America’s Food Basket, a look of worry on her face as she shopped with her daughter and young grandson. Ms. Duncan, 65, had $52 of her $289 monthly food benefit left, and little hope that her card would be reloaded on Sunday as scheduled.\n\nShe placed one can of pinto beans in her cart. “I think I have another can at home,” she said. Then she leaned in to study the jugs of canola oil on the shelf.\n\n“Oh, child,” she said softly to her daughter. “Does that say $6.49?”\n\n“That’s too much,” her daughter, Levitica Thomas, 46, replied.\n\nAcross the country, families like Ms. Duncan’s woke to another day of anxiety about how they would get their next meals in the weeks ahead. Federal courts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts issued rulings on Friday ordering the Trump administration to continue funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through the government shutdown. The regular budget for the program was set to run out on Saturday.\n\nPresident Trump, who had previously refused to tap emergency funds to continue the food benefits, said after the court rulings that his administration would do so. But he warned that the flow of benefits would be delayed as he sought further direction from the courts on how to “legally” comply, and as states resumed distributing the money.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And it was only after a federal judge intervened that President Trump signaled he could use the money for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.\n\nEven now, much remains unclear about whether or when poor families may receive their scheduled benefits. Still, the saga has laid bare the shutdown strategy at the White House, where Mr. Trump has been willing to shield only some Americans from the harms of a fiscal standoff that he has made no effort to resolve.\n\nIn what may become the longest federal stoppage in history, the president has frequently bent the rules of budget, primarily to reap political benefits or exact retribution. He has found new and untested ways to spare certain Americans, like the military, from the pain of the government closure, while claiming he has no power to help others, including low-income individuals who rely on benefits like SNAP.\n\nThe result is a shutdown unlike any other, one that has posed disparate and debilitating risks for those unlucky enough to depend on the many functions of government that Mr. Trump has long aspired to cut.\n\n“They are willing to hurt people at the bottom when they take care of their friends and priorities,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. But Mr. Trump said in a social media post on Friday that he would release the funds for SNAP only after the court clarified its ruling.\n\n“I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,” he said.\n\nAt the heart of Mr. Trump’s actions is a belief that the president possesses vast power over the nation’s spending, even though the Constitution vests that authority with Congress. Mr. Trump and his budget director, Russell T. Vought, have dismantled entire agencies, fired thousands of workers and canceled or halted billions of dollars in federal spending — all without the express permission of lawmakers.\n\nThe White House has pursued these cuts in a bid to shrink domestic spending to its lowest level in modern history, primarily by targeting federal climate, education, health, housing and research programs, and a bevy of initiatives that aid the poor. All the while, the administration has proposed pumping new money into the military and the various agencies that conduct mass deportations.\n\nIt is a fiscal vision that Mr. Trump outlined in his 2026 budget, which he released in the spring, and one that he has sought to advance in a series of unorthodox moves since the government came to a halt on Oct. 1.\n\nSoon after the shutdown began, the Trump administration began to shuffle around tens of billions of dollars to provide paychecks to military service members and law enforcement agents, including border officers. To do so, officials tapped a range of research, housing, procurement and legal funds, including money approved as part of the president’s recently enacted tax package.\n\nMany budget experts described these moves at the time as unusual, and potentially illegal, given federal law generally prevents the government from spending and transferring money in ways Congress did not permit. Mr. Vance, for his part, likened the budget scenario last week to a “leak,” adding the administration was doing everything in its power to “plug it with bubble gum.”\n\n“Why don’t the Democrats just stop this entire charade and reopen the government, so that we don’t have to try to make this thing work on a shoestring budget,” added Mr. Vance, who said the president had done “everything that he can” to stem the pain of the shutdown.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has offered no lifeline to the hundreds of thousands of workers across government who are furloughed. Instead, the Trump administration embarked on an effort to fire some of them, while aides threatened to deny out-of-work employees their automatic back pay once the shutdown concluded. It was Mr. Trump who signed the law in 2019 that would require the retroactive payments.\n\nThe push for mass firings punctuated Mr. Trump’s recent pledge to enact permanent cuts to “Democrat programs,” a term he has never clearly defined. Previously, though, the president has proposed to slash a wide range of anti-poverty initiatives — a set of benefits that Mr. Trump has allowed to languish during the current shutdown.\n\nDespite all of its work to reprogram the budget, the White House has not announced plans to move around money to sustain Head Start, which funds child care and education. It is now facing a shortfall, threatening local programs that serve about 65,000 children. The administration at one point considered staggering budget cuts for Head Start in the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nThe White House has similarly said little about the fate of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps poor Americans cover home heating bills. The administration had proposed in its latest budget to eliminate the initiative, which faces a shutdown funding shortfall with winter approaching.\n\nBut the biggest blow was set to arrive on Saturday, when funding officially ran out for SNAP, which serves one in eight Americans. That raised the risk that millions of low-income families would lose benefits absent a last-minute federal intervention.\n\nInitially, the Agriculture Department signaled that it would stave off an interruption to food stamps by tapping a set of emergency reserves, totaling about $5 billion — enough to provide at least partial payments. But the agency abruptly reversed course in late October, citing legal, technical and budgetary reasons for the change.\n\n“It is only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded,” Brooke L. Rollins, the agriculture secretary, told reporters on Friday.\n\nShe added that the emergency funding “doesn’t even cover, I think, half” of what would be needed to provision benefits this month.\n\nThe White House also refused to source funds from a second account with billions of dollars, comprised largely of tariff revenues. It declined to do so even though the administration had taken the same approach with another federal nutrition program during the shutdown.\n\nDemocrats in Congress quickly cried foul, framing the peril facing SNAP as the latest attempt by Republicans to starve a program they had already cut dramatically to help pay for their package of tax cuts this year. Believing the program to be saddled with waste, fraud and abuse, Mr. Trump imposed new work requirements on aid recipients, part of a series of changes that were expected to remove millions from SNAP.\n\nThe looming shutdown lapse also prompted cities, states, faith groups, nonprofits and others to file lawsuits, as they looked to spare millions of people from hunger and financial hardship. By Friday, two courts had found that Mr. Trump’s deputies had acted unlawfully, and one judge ordered the government to use its emergency funds to pay SNAP benefits this week.\n\nReacting to the news, Mr. Trump did not acknowledge that his administration could have tried to provision benefits sooner. But the president did call attention to his strategy of selective relief.\n\n“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,” Mr. Trump said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5q05v0q1xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:01:06.900+00:00","title":"Andrew fixed palace visit for firm with £1.4m deal with ex-wife","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew Mountbatten Windsor arranged a private tour of Buckingham Palace in June 2019 for Jay Bloom and Michael Evers, two businessmen linked to Pegasus Group Holdings, a failed cryptocurrency mining venture.

private tour of Buckingham Palace while the late Queen was in residence, for businessmen from a cryptocurrency mining firm which agreed to pay his ex-wife up to £1.4m, the BBC can reveal.\n\nJay Bloom and his colleague Michael Evers were driven through the palace gates in the former prince's own car after being collected from their five-star Knightsbridge hotel for the visit in June 2019.\n\nTheir company, Pegasus Group Holdings, which Mr Bloom co-founded, employed Sarah Ferguson as a \"brand ambassador\" for a crypto-mining scheme which would lose investors millions when it failed less than a year later.\n\nMr Bloom, an entrepreneur who had previously set up a failed Mafia-themed museum in Las Vegas, and Mr Evers, a former actor, were met by a greeter and escorted inside the palace.\n\nMr Evers told the BBC they then met the Queen, although Mr Bloom disputed this.\n\nBoth Mr Evers and Mr Bloom were invited by the then-prince to his Pitch@Palace event - a Dragons' Den-style business pitching competition - at nearby St James's Palace later that day, and they dined that evening with Andrew, Ms Ferguson and their daughter Princess Beatrice.\n\nMs Ferguson was working with Pegasus Group Holdings at the time of the palace visit, while she was Duchess of York, to promote plans to use thousands of solar power generators to mine Bitcoin at a remote site in the Arizona desert.\n\nBut the project ultimately failed with only 615 of the planned 16,000 generators acquired and just $33,779 (about £25,000) in cryptocurrency mined.\n\nIn April 2021, some investors took legal action, claiming millions of dollars of investor funds were unaccounted for. A tribunal awarded the investors $4.1m, but Mr Bloom is seeking permission to appeal.\n\nThe revelations add to growing questions about how Andrew and his former wife have funded their lifestyle, as well as long-standing concerns about their business connections and that the then-prince may have used his royal titles and connections for private gain.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Buckingham Palace announced that it was starting the formal process of  stripping Andrew of his royal titles  and that he would be losing his Windsor mansion, following intense criticism of  his links with the billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein .\n\nAndrew and Ms Ferguson did not respond to a detailed list of questions about their involvement with Mr Bloom and the crypto-mining venture.\n\nSarah Ferguson was paid more than £200,000 for her work for the company and a leaked contract reveals she was in line for a separate bonus worth £1.2m.\n\nShe also received a stake in the business, which proposed using solar generators to reduce the cost of the energy-intensive computer calculations needed to generate or \"mine\" the digital currency Bitcoin.\n\nHer contract stipulated that she required first-class travel, five-star hotels and the services of a professional hairdresser and make-up artist for the maximum of four \"networking events\" she would attend on the company's behalf.\n\nIt said she did not \"hold herself out as an expert on the solar industry\" and therefore accepted no responsibility for \"industry-related information or commercial assessments\" used as the basis for her statements promoting the company.\n\nSarah Ferguson first met the Las Vegas businessman Jay Bloom in May 2018 when she was at a convention in the city to promote one of her children's books.\n\nThe pair struck up a friendship and business relationship.\n\nPegasus documents would subsequently describe her role as to \"engage with the company's clients, investors and strategic relationships\" as well as involvement with the company's planned \"philanthropic activities\".\n\nFor Mr Bloom, it was an introduction to royal circles which would lead to visits to Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, a tour of Ms Ferguson and Andrew's home, the Royal Lodge in Windsor, and dinners with her and her family in at least four different countries.\n\nEight years before the duchess signed up to be a brand ambassador for Pegasus, Mr Bloom had hit the Las Vegas headlines, accused of missing payments and deceiving investors in connection with a \"mob experience\" exhibition in the city. Mr Bloom denied wrongdoing, fought investors' lawsuits and vowed to repay them.\n\nHe now had a new company, Pegasus, and ambitions to build a hotel and casino in Greece.\n\nIt was there in July 2018, while considering investing in the company, that Michael Evers, a former actor and reality TV star who had made money from cryptocurrency investments, first met Ms Ferguson.\n\nThe hotel and casino did not get built, but Mr Bloom had soon pivoted Pegasus to a new idea, one that was inspired by seeing a mobile solar power generator in use at the Las Vegas motor speedway in early 2019, according to filings in the later legal action brought by investors.\n\nMr Bloom and his co-founders hit upon a plan to use vast banks of these units to power a crypto-mining operation. The endeavour, the company estimated, would generate millions of dollars a month.\n\nIn March 2019, Ms Ferguson had dinner with Mr Bloom in Los Angeles. They had lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel a few days later as she helped him try to close a deal for Pegasus. One of her daughters stopped by during the meal.\n\nMr Evers was now working for Pegasus as well as being an investor. He said he and Mr Bloom were regularly in London over the following months as they explored taking Pegasus public on the AIM market - part of the London Stock Exchange for growing companies.\n\nHe said he got to know Ms Ferguson and her family and \"through all that, I met Prince Andrew [and] Princess Beatrice and a lot of their family\" who he described as \"really great people, really friendly\".\n\n\"We were there once a month for a week to two weeks at a time and every time the relationships just kind of grew stronger and stronger and they started offering tours of different places, I guess like behind the scenes or I don't know what you'd call it,\" Mr Evers said. \"And just wanting to introduce us to more and more people.\"\n\nAs well as a tour of the Royal Lodge, Andrew and his ex-wife arranged for the pair to visit Buckingham Palace on a day in June 2019 when it was closed to the public.\n\nThey were picked up from their Knightsbridge hotel by an official driver in a dark blue Range Rover used by Andrew and driven through the palace gates in the early afternoon.\n\nOnce inside they were taken through to the inner courtyard, where a female greeter was waiting to meet them. A video taken by the men from inside the car captured their arrival.\n\nA former Royal Household employee, who reviewed the footage, told BBC News that it was clear that palace security staff on the gate were expecting the vehicle.\n\n\"The ramp was dropped before they came out to speak to the driver,\" they said. \"That was the reception we'd expect if we were carrying a member of the Royal Family.\"\n\nWhat happened once they went inside is disputed by the two men.\n\nMr Evers said they had been told in advance that there would be an opportunity to meet the Queen. But once there, he said staff told him he was not allowed to take photos.\n\n\"They didn't want anyone knowing that we were meeting Elizabeth. And it was very, very brief, she was not doing super well, so it was more just like a hello and in passing. No touching or anything,\" he said.\n\nHe said it wasn't a formal meeting, \"it was just like a quick, 'hello, goodbye'\".\n\nThe Queen was in residence that day, with her published schedule including her regular weekly audience with the prime minister. The Palace was unable to confirm or deny whether the introduction with the two men took place.\n\nResponding to questions by email, Mr Bloom initially said he had decided just to visit the palace as a tourist. He subsequently said the only person he met at the palace was a \"staffer\".\n\nWhen challenged and presented with evidence from his own social media, which included footage of him being driven into the palace, and comments about spending time with Andrew, and there being \"pictures I can post, the pictures I can't, and then the stuff I couldn't take pictures of... lol\", Mr Bloom said he had misremembered.\n\nHe then admitted that he \"was in fact shown to Andrews [sic] office and did thank him for the car and for him and Sarah arranging the tour\".\n\nHe denied ever having met or been in the same room as the late Queen.\n\nMr Bloom made a second visit to Buckingham Palace in July 2019, photos show. On social media he made an apparently joking reference to \"meeting HRH\".\n\nTwo months later, Ms Ferguson was one of two celebrity guests - alongside the motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who says he has coached figures such as Serena Williams and Hugh Jackman - at a \"ground breaking\" for Pegasus's energy project launch in the Arizona desert.\n\nThey were flown in, with Mr Bloom, Mr Evers and others, in two black-and-gold helicopters and posed with gold-coloured spades and construction hats at the remote site of what Pegasus promised would become a multi-billion-dollar off-grid data centre.\n\nWith armed guards with AR-15 rifles and pistols standing nearby, Mr Bloom introduced Ms Ferguson at a press conference as a \"personal friend\".\n\nIn the short speech that followed, Ms Ferguson praised the company, saying she was \"so proud to be here\" and touted the potential philanthropic uses of the technology in Africa.\n\nThat October, a month before Andrew's fateful BBC Newsnight interview where he disastrously attempted to explain his connections to Mr Epstein, Ms Ferguson signed a contract agreeing to provide specific services for Pegasus.\n\nFor reasons that remain unexplained, the contract itself was with Alphabet Capital, a British company whose owner, Adrian Gleave, ran a number of caravan and holiday parks.\n\nA High Court ruling in London in 2024 has previously revealed that Ms Ferguson received more than £200,000 for her work for Pegasus from Alphabet Capital.\n\nAndrew has also received money from Alphabet, including £60,500 traced to Mr Gleave and his businesses, according to  court documents previously reported by the BBC .\n\nNeither Andrew nor Mr Gleave have explained why this money was paid.\n\nMr Bloom said he has never heard of Alphabet or Mr Gleave and there was no connection with Pegasus.\n\nA year after investing millions of dollars in the crypto solar scheme, some of its main investors became concerned about progress and began legal proceedings.\n\nIn 2023, judges from the Commercial Arbitration Tribunal in the US found in the investors' favour awarding them millions of dollars.\n\nJay Bloom has since mounted a number of legal challenges over the award in the Nevada courts.\n\nMr Bloom told BBC News that Pegasus emphatically disputed \"any allegations of misconduct\" and said they were \"addressing the clearly flawed arbitral findings through established legal processes\".\n\nAndrew and Ms Ferguson did not respond to the BBC's questions, including whether Ms Ferguson planned to repay money received for her Pegasus work to the company's investors.\n\nMr Evers said he regretted being involved with Pegasus. He said Mr Bloom was \"working very, very hard to get all the investors paid back\" but that he was frustrated to still be owed money himself several years later."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/opinion/democrats-liberalism-elections-crick.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-10","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"City Launches New Program to Combat Youth Unemployment","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to growing concerns about youth unemployment, the city council has launched the Bright Futures Initiative, a comprehensive program aimed at preparing young people for the workforce.

Does it need to be more populist? More moderate? More socialist? Embrace the abundance agenda? Produce more vertical video?\n\nThe answer is yes, yes to all of it — but to none of it in particular. The Democratic Party does not need to choose to be one thing. It needs to choose to be more things.\n\nIn two days, there will be elections for governor of New Jersey, for mayor of New York City and for governor of Virginia. Democrats are leading in all of these races. As of now, the RealClearPolitics polling averages show the Democrat up by about seven points in Virginia and about three points in New Jersey. These are not unusual leads in what have become reliably Democratic states. You can imagine a world where the violence and corruption of President Trump’s first nine months in office had led to a collapse in support for him and his party. We’ll see what Election Day brings. But we do not look to be in that world.\n\nThat’s all the more true if you look a year out, to the midterms. In the RealClearPolitics polling average, Democrats are leading by about 2.5 points when you ask Americans which party they want to see control Congress. At about this time in 2017, Democrats were up just over 10 points in the same average.\n\nThe news gets worse. To win the House back next year, Democrats will need to overcome the chain of redistricting Republicans are setting off across the country: Republicans have already redrawn the maps in Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas; they are seeking to do the same in Florida and Indiana, and they have others in their sights.\n\nThe Senate is even harder for Democrats: They will need to flip four seats in the 2026 midterms to win back control. That would mean defending seats in Georgia and Michigan, winning in Maine and North Carolina — no easy task — and then winning at least two seats in states that Trump won by 10 points or more, such as Alaska, Florida, Iowa, Ohio or Texas. That’s not some quirk of the 2026 Senate map. There are 24 states that Trump won by 10 points or more in 2024.\n\nAny enduring majority — any real power — will require Democrats to solve a problem they do not yet know how to solve: The number of places in which the Democratic Party is competitive has shrunk. When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Democrats held Senate seats in Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and West Virginia. How many of those states remain in reach for Democrats today?\n\nIn American politics, power is not decided by a popular vote. In the Electoral College, in the House of Representatives, and particularly in the Senate, it is apportioned by place. Democrats don’t just need to win more people. They also need to win more places. That will require a more pluralistic approach to politics. It will require the Democratic Party to see internal difference as a strength that requires cultivation rather than a flaw that demands purification.\n\nThink of it this way: If Zohran Mamdani wins the New York mayor’s race running as a democratic socialist in New York City and Rob Sand wins the Iowa governor’s race next year running as a moderate who hates political parties, did the Democratic Party move left or right? Neither: It got bigger. It found a way to represent more kinds of people in more kinds of places.\n\nThat is the spirit it needs to embrace. Not moderation. Not progressivism. But, in the older political sense of the term, representation.\n\nIn 1962, Bernard Crick, a political theorist and a democratic socialist, published a strange little book called “In Defense of Politics.” Politics, for Crick, was something precious and specific: It “arises from accepting the fact of the simultaneous existence of different groups, hence different interests and different traditions, within a territorial unit under a common rule.”\n\nThe fact of difference is not always accepted. There are other forms of social order, like tyranny or oligarchy, that actively suppress it. But to practice politics as Crick defines it is to accept the reality of difference — that is to say, it is to accept the reality of other people whose values and views differ deeply from yours.\n\nIn my favorite line from the book, Crick writes, “Politics involves genuine relationships with people who are genuinely other people, not tasks set for our redemption or objects for our philanthropy.”\n\nI love that. I think the path to a better politics — perhaps even a political majority — lives within it.\n\nThe endless fantasy in politics is persuasion without representation: You elect us to represent you, and where we disagree, we will explain to you why you are wrong. The result of that politics tends to be neither persuasion nor representation: People know when you are not listening to them. And they know how to respond: They stop listening to you. They vote for people who they feel do listen to them.\n\nI am not a pessimist on the possibility of persuasion. But I believe it is rare outside a context of mutual respect. And if I were to say where the Democratic Party went wrong over the last decade, it’s there. In too many places Democrats sought persuasion without representation, and so they got neither.\n\nA Democratic strategist who has conducted countless focus groups told me that when he asks people to describe the two parties, they often describe Republicans as “crazy” and Democrats as “preachy.” One woman said to him, “I’ll take crazy over preachy. At least crazy doesn’t look down on me.”\n\nThat echoes what I have heard from the kinds of voters Democrats lament losing. I feel as if I have the same conversation over and over again: Sometimes people tell me about issues where the Democratic Party departed from them. But they first describe a more fundamental feeling of alienation: The Democratic Party, they came to believe, does not like them.\n\nMany of these people voted for Democrats until a few years ago. They didn’t feel their fundamental beliefs had changed. But they began to feel like “deplorables.” They began to feel unwanted.\n\nWhen I’d push on the experiences they had — when I would ask which Democrats, who were they talking about — I often found they were reacting to a cultural vibe or an online skirmish as much or more than a flesh-and-blood party. But they had felt something change, and I knew they were right.\n\nSomething had changed. It had changed on the left. It had changed on the right. The structure of American life changed in a way that has made the genuine relationships of politics much harder. Instead of representing many different kinds of people in many different kinds of places, the parties now tilt toward the place in which the elite of both sides spend most of their time and get most of their information. The first party that finds its way out of this trap will be the one able to build a majority in this era.\n\nWhen I grew up, in a Republican county an hour south of Los Angeles, my family subscribed to The Los Angeles Times, and to the extent I heard political commentary, it was on local radio. Now The New York Times is, by subscribers, the largest news outlet in California, and a young, politically inclined kid will listen to podcasts like mine, or “The Daily” or “Pod Save America” or Ben Shapiro.\n\nTheir political sensibility will be less distinctly Californian and more relentlessly national. The same is true for someone in Montana or Kentucky or Texas or Illinois. For decades, we’ve been losing local media and migrating to national media. That means politics everywhere is losing its local character and reflecting national divisions.\n\nThen there’s the astonishing amount of money politicians need and the places they go to find it. In the 1970s, the Supreme Court decided money was speech. Campaigns became more expensive. Candidates often need a lot more money than what they can raise in their own states and districts. They seek support from political action committees that can spend more freely. That means exciting donors who are much further to the left or right than the public or winning over interest groups that seek their support on policy. Money can polarize and it can corrupt; either way, it pulls candidates away from representing their constituents.\n\nThat was all true when I moved to Washington to cover politics in 2005. Already, politics was becoming more polarized and more nationalized. But two years later, the iPhone was released. By 2013, more than half of American adults had a smartphone. In 2016, Twitter went algorithmic.\n\nWe all know this changed politics. But for all the words that have been spilled on it, we still miss how fundamentally it has altered the day-to-day work of politics. The work of political representation has always been bedeviled by an information problem: How do you know the people you are representing? How do you tell the people you are representing what you’ve done? Everyone working in politics had too little information. Now they have too much information. And it’s the wrong information.\n\nI cannot overstate how much this next dynamic has changed politics at every level: Before the advent of social media, everyone in politics was not talking to everyone else in politics all of the time. It wasn’t possible. People who worked in politics in different places had their own local political communities — if you did campaigns in Kentucky, it was not easy to be in constant contact with political operatives in California. Different jobs had their own professional communities. The political consultants were separate from the grass-roots activists who were separate from the Hill staffers who were separate from the think tankers who were separate from the journalists who were separate from the pollsters who were separate from the politicians.\n\nPeople talked to each other before social media. I am not saying they didn’t. There were conferences and lunches and phone calls and panel discussions. But they weren’t all talking to one another all at once, all of the time. And this affects even the people in politics who are not on social media because they are still operating in a professional community where their colleagues are shaped by it. Attention is the most valuable currency in modern politics, and these platforms are where it is traded. This is of course true on the right, where many of the president’s most consequential statements are delivered on the social media platform he owns. But it is also true on the left.\n\nSince the 2024 election, there has been a lot of talk on the Democratic side about the power of the so-called groups — the progressive advocacy organizations and nonprofits that have arguably pushed Democrats to the left. I’ve used that term before, but I think it’s imprecise.\n\nThe real thing we’re talking about here is what might be called the professional political classes. The groups that we’re talking about are downstream from the progressive professional political class. The people in them are the same people who staff or drive the other parts of progressive politics: One year you’re with a nonprofit, then you’re on a campaign, then you’re in the White House, then you’re back at a group. You’re followed on X or Bluesky by left-leaning journalists like me, by producers at MSNBC or breaking news reporters at Politico. It’s not a bunch of groups. It’s a professional community that exists largely online.\n\nAnd so that professional community’s culture and attention are governed not by its values or its goals but by the decisions of the corporations and oligarchs who own the social media platforms and design them to further their profits or their politics. The conversations pulsing across these platforms are shaped not by civic values but by whatever proves to keep people scrolling: Nuanced opinions are compressed into viral slogans; attention collects around the loudest and most controversial voices; algorithms love conflict, inspiration, outrage and anger. Everything is always turned up to 11.\n\nSocial media has thrown everyone involved at every level of politics in every place into the same algorithmic Thunderdome. It has collapsed distance and profession and time because no matter where we are, we can always be online together. We always know what our most online peers are thinking. They come to set the culture of their respective political classes. And there is nothing that most of us fear as much as being out of step with our peers.\n\nThis has affected the Democratic and Republican Parties in different ways. Let me start with the Democrats.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2024, Democrats moved sharply left on virtually every issue. They often did so arguing that they were finally representing communities that had long suffered from too little representation. This was what they were told to do by the online voices and professional groups that claimed to represent these communities.\n\nBut it went wrong. Democrats became more uncompromising on immigration and lost support among Hispanic voters. They moved left on guns and student loans and climate, and lost ground with young voters. They moved left on race and lost ground with Black voters. They moved left on education and lost ground with Asian American voters. They moved left on economics and lost ground with working-class voters. The only major group in which Democrats saw improvement across that whole 12-year period was college-educated white voters.\n\nIf you judged Democratic politics expressively — by what the people in it were saying — it stood in solidarity with the struggling and the marginalized as never before. If you judged it consequentially — based on what happened, who it attracted, the power it won or lost — it was breaking faith with those it had vowed to represent and protect.\n\nOnline, politics is expressive, and most political speech is aimed at those who already agree with the speaker. Offline, power is won and lost in elections. Winning elections means winning over voters who have no voice in the professional political world. Passing policy into law means building coalitions that include views and members who are held in very low esteem in the more ideologically pure world of online politics.\n\nFor instance, in 2010, Joe Manchin ran for Senate in West Virginia with this memorable ad:\n\nYes, that was Manchin shooting the cap-and-trade bill with a rifle. But 12 years later, Manchin was the key vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act — the single largest green energy investment in American history. Progressives hated negotiating with Manchin. But for everything they believed, it was so much better to have him there than to have a Republican in his seat. And Manchin’s ability to hold that seat was remarkable: In 2012, Mitt Romney won West Virginia by 27 points; in 2016, Donald Trump won it by 42 points.\n\nExpressively, Manchin was a constant irritant. Consequentially, he was the Democrats’ most remarkable overperformer. He made their Senate majority possible by winning elections no Democrat should have been able to win. But Manchin was loathed and protested against by progressives. In the end, he left the Democratic Party before retiring from the Senate in 2024.\n\nToday’s Democratic Party has taken forms of disagreement and difference it once held inside its coalition and pushed them outside its coalition. Republicans have helped, of course — as Democrats moved left, Republicans have beaten candidates holding both purple and red seats, where the Democratic Party’s brand has become toxic. But the culture changed on the Democrats’ side, too. To countenance compromise and differences on key issues began to be treated as betrayal, not as a necessary part of building power.\n\nIn 2010, when the Affordable Care Act passed, the crucial vote in the Senate came from Ben Nelson, a pro-life Democrat from Nebraska. There were, then, roughly 40 pro-life Democrats serving in the House. Reaching compromises across these disagreements was hard. But Democrats were able to pass Obamacare, which expanded reproductive health coverage and remains the greatest Democratic policy accomplishment of the 21st century. That same Democratic Party — with all its internal disagreements — had the votes to confirm Supreme Court justices who would and did protect Roe v. Wade. That Democratic Party was less lock step in its values but better able to turn those values into policy.\n\nI have been in a debate recently about whether Democrats should run pro-life candidates in red states in much the way that Republicans run pro-choice candidates like Susan Collins and Larry Hogan in blue states. Collins’s perceived moderation helps Republicans hold a Senate seat in an increasingly blue state. Hogan didn’t win his race, but he was the Republicans’ strongest over-performer in 2024.\n\nI was taken aback to hear people say, in response to this argument, that I just wanted to throw reproductive rights overboard. I have spoken before about my own family’s history with traumatic and dangerous pregnancies. That decision should not belong to the state. For that reason, I want a Democratic Party big enough and strong enough to protect reproductive rights. We cannot protect or restore reproductive rights if the coalition that cares about them cannot compete in more places.\n\nThat said, in most places, post-Dobbs, reproductive rights are one of the Democrats’ better issues. This is about a broader approach to politics. Competing in more places might mean representing views Democrats struggle with on immigration or guns or trade or crime or climate or trans rights. When those disagreements are inside the tent, commonality can be found across divides because people agree on other issues and trust one another in other ways. Manchin, despite being pro-life, voted to put Ketanji Brown Jackson on the Supreme Court.\n\nOne worry I have about Democrats right now is that they do not want to confront how much of the country disagrees with them.\n\nPolls show that the percentage of voters saying the Democratic Party is too liberal increased sharply between 2012 and 2024. The percentage of voters saying the Republican Party is too conservative fell during that same period. Even the violence and corruption of Trump’s second administration have not fully closed the gap: A September poll from The Washington Post and Ipsos found that 54 percent of voters thought the Democratic Party was too liberal and 49 percent thought the Republican Party was too conservative.\n\nI would like to believe that all the Democrats need to do to win back these voters is to embrace an agenda I’m already comfortable with: economic populism or abundance or both. But I don’t think it’s true. A study by the Center for Working-Class Politics found that in key Rust Belt states, when you attached the Democratic label to a candidate running on a populist platform, that candidate lost 11 to 16 points in support. That’s how Sherrod Brown, once one of the strongest economic populists in American politics, lost his Ohio Senate seat to a Republican car dealer who had to settle more than a dozen lawsuits for wage theft.\n\nThe problem with seeing either populism or abundance as the sole answer for Democrats is both of them assume that the public basically agrees with Democrats. In many places that’s true, and so that’s enough. But in other places it’s just not true: Across much of this country, voters don’t agree with the Democratic Party as they understand it, and more fundamentally, they believe the Democratic Party doesn’t agree with — or respect — them.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board recently looked at the members of Congress representing districts that the opposite party carried in the presidential election. Democrats in districts that went for Trump all emphasized their disagreement with and independence from the Democratic Party in various ways.\n\nJared Golden is a Democrat from Maine. In 2024, he edged out a victory in a district Trump won by nearly 10 points. No other Democrat in Congress — not one — has survived in such a pro-Trump district. There’s a lot of populism in Golden’s politics. There’s a lot of “let’s make government work.” And there’s a lot of moderation. Golden won with ads like this one:\n\nNow, in what strikes me as an absolutely insane turn of events, Golden is facing a primary challenge from a progressive candidate who says Golden’s independence has “disenchanted” Democrats in Maine. Instead of learning from Democrats like Golden — Democrats who are successfully representing voters who are otherwise moving toward Trump — some progressives want to purge them.\n\nAgain, I want to be clear that I am making something different from an argument for pure moderation: I do not think the Democratic Party should just move right.\n\nIt is good that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mamdani run as Democrats, and that Bernie Sanders has become a leader in the Democratic Party. It is good that you can be an out-and-out democratic socialist in today’s Democratic Party. When I got into politics, none of that was true. Back then, I used to criticize the Democratic establishment for how much it feared its own left. Then, you could barely call yourself a liberal. Today, you can run as a democratic socialist. That’s progress.\n\nBut what happened over the past 15 years is that the Democratic Party has made room on its left and closed down on its right. For all the talk of what the Democratic Party should learn from Sanders and Mamdani, there should be at least as much talk of what they should learn from Manchin or Golden or Marie Gluesenkamp Perez or Sarah McBride. The party should be seeking more, not less, internal disagreement.\n\nChanging a culture is harder than changing a policy. Moderating on this or that issue is more straightforward than finding ways to radiate respect and interest in people who disagree with you and people you’ve come to feel far away from. It’s the building of genuine relationships in politics, not the taking of positions, that’s the hard part.\n\nBut it’s also beautiful. It’s a privilege to do that work, not a concession. We are quicker to admit complexity and extend generosity when we see others as part of our community. Working to widen that circle of empathy — to widen our circle of belonging — is both morally and politically good.\n\nWhatever the problems are on the left, there’s something truly frightening brewing on the right. Paul Ingrassia, Trump’s nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, said on a text thread leaked to Politico that he had “a Nazi streak.” A separate text thread of young Republican leaders leaked to Politico had messages about sending enemies to the gas chambers and one saying, “I love Hitler.”\n\nIngrassia had to withdraw his nomination, but Vice President JD Vance dismissed coverage of the young Republicans’ messages as “pearl-clutching.” He said, “I really don’t want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke, telling a very offensive, stupid joke is cause to ruin their lives.” These were, it should be said, recent statements by adults who were vying for leadership in a political organization with official ties to the Republican Party.\n\nThen, while I was finishing up this essay, Tucker Carlson hosted Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who has spoken often of his admiration for Hitler, for a friendly two-hour chat — and Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation and a key architect of Project 2025, initially backed Carlson, complaining about the “venomous coalition” arrayed against him.\n\nThere is no rule of civic generosity or political practice that Trumpism hasn’t broken. And for many I know on the left, it’s led to a kind of political despair: Look at how extreme the right has become. Yet it has thrived. In this telling, Trump understands what the Democrats don’t: There are no rules anymore in politics. Nothing matters anymore except attention.\n\nBut a few things are wrong with that.\n\nFirst, Trump did moderate the Republican Party in crucial areas: Medicare, Social Security and trade.\n\nSecond, Democrats can’t win the way Trump and the Republicans do. This goes back to the problem of place: Trump and the Republicans lead a coalition built on overwhelming strength in rural counties. America’s place-based politics gives rural places disproportionate political power. Trump and the Republicans can hold power with a smaller coalition than Democrats can.\n\nAnd finally, Democrats shouldn’t want to win the way Trump’s Republicans do. This country could break. The abyss is dark and it is deep, and America, like other countries, has fallen into it before and can again. I see the simple fact of a free and fair politics as more of an achievement today than I did 20 years ago. I no longer take it, or the habits of citizenship or politics that preserve it, for granted. We cannot trust that providence or some innate exceptionalism protects us from calamity. It doesn’t.\n\nOver the past year, I have found myself obsessively reading histories of liberalism, looking for something, even though I didn’t know exactly what.\n\nIlliberalism is winning right now. But there is nothing unusual about that. By modern standards, virtually every past society was illiberal. That we now call them illiberal, that exclusion and domination and state suppression have been made strange enough to demand a label: That is the unlikely achievement.\n\nHow did liberalism do it? Because liberalism today feels exhausted to me. It does not feel up to this challenge. Did it fail us or did we fail it?\n\nFor most of my life, when I called myself a liberal I meant, basically, someone who believed in universal health care, the right to form a union, racial equality and Social Security. But in her book “The Lost History of Liberalism,” the Swedish historian Helena Rosenblatt shows that in its oldest forms, liberalism was built on a virtue that we rarely talk about today. “To the ancient Romans,” Rosenblatt writes, “being free required more than a republican constitution; it also required citizens who practiced liberalitas, which referred to a noble and generous way of thinking and acting toward one’s fellow citizens.”\n\nThe word “liberalitas” became “liberality,” and it was discussed and debated for nearly 2,000 years before liberalism became a part of anyone’s political vocabulary. Liberality came to mean something like, as Rosenblatt puts it, “demonstrating the virtues of a citizen, showing devotion to the common good, and respecting the importance of mutual connectedness.”\n\nIt flowered into religious tolerance when that idea was truly radical — when mainstream thought held that the violent persecution of heretics was an act of charity because it would keep others in the church. Liberality proposed a different way of relating across disagreement and division. It built toward liberalism’s great insight, what Edmund Fawcett, in his book “Liberalism: The Life of an Idea,” calls liberalism’s first guiding idea: “Conflict of interests and beliefs was, to the liberal mind, inescapable. If tamed and turned to competition in a stable political order, conflict could nevertheless bear fruit as argument, experiment, and exchange.”\n\nToday, political tolerance is harder for many of us than religious tolerance. Finding ways to turn our disagreements into exchange, into something fruitful rather than something destructive, seems almost fanciful. But there is real political opportunity — dare I say, a real political majority — for the coalition that can do it.\n\nI saw a poll a few weeks ago that struck me. It was from The New York Times and Siena University. It asked Americans what they thought the top problem facing the country was. No. 1 was the economy. That was what I expected. But No. 2 wasn’t immigration or inflation or democracy or climate change or even Trump. It was political division. In that same poll, 64 percent of the country said we’re too divided to solve our problems. They’re not wrong.\n\nRight now, the project of America feels, to many, impossible. And not just on the left. I hear it every time Vance or Stephen Miller speaks. I hear it when Trump says, “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them.” When I hear that, I hear something scary, but I also hear an opening, an opportunity: In the end, most Americans want America to work. They know we disagree with one another. They don’t want us to hate one another. These divisions exist not just in the country but also in our communities, in our families. They’re painful. They want politicians capable of making that problem better, not worse.\n\nI find I keep coming back to something Crick said. For him, what emerges out of politics is both beautiful and rare, “something to be valued almost as a pearl beyond price.” He writes that “The moral consensus of a free state is not something mysteriously prior to or above politics: It is the activity (the civilizing activity) of politics itself.”\n\nIn America — for all our sins, our injustice, our oppression — a freer state emerged through the practice of politics. It did not do so painlessly or bloodlessly. But it happened. It gave us confidence in ourselves and in our system. It showed what could emerge from genuine relationships with people who are genuinely other people, and it could again.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

She rushed home and packed a bag for her new twins — a book for baby footprints, matching outfits and beanies and blankets embroidered with their names. Then she jumped back in the car and raced down Interstate 390 to a small hospital 130 miles away in a rural corner of the state.\n\nWhen MaryBeth arrived at the maternity ward, she found her surrogate in a recovery room, tired but happy after a quick delivery. She asked to see the twins, and a nurse went to go find them. But before she returned, a different woman dressed in scrubs appeared and got in MaryBeth’s face. “What you did was terrible,” the woman said. “You will never see these babies.” MaryBeth tried to talk to her, but the woman refused to listen. A voice over the loudspeaker announced that visiting hours were over. “And that means you,” the woman said.\n\nIn the hospital parking lot, MaryBeth sat in her car and cried. “I’m thinking, What the hell did I do to have somebody say this to me?”\n\nMaryBeth loves children. She always has. When she was a little girl, she had a routine. Every night, she gathered up her sisters’ dolls in the corner of the living room. Her mother would stand in the doorway and smile as MaryBeth sang them lullabies and tucked in each of the 10 babies with small pillows and blankets.\n\nMaryBeth was 25 when she married a pilot named Bob Lewis. The couple had five daughters. When the girls neared adulthood and empty-nest syndrome kicked in, MaryBeth wanted more children. In her late 40s, she used in vitro fertilization to give birth to twin girls. And she wasn’t done. Despite medical mishaps, miscarriages and raised eyebrows from friends, she kept going, and going, eventually giving birth to her 13th child at the remarkable age of 62.\n\nBut to bring this last set of twins into the world, MaryBeth went further — she tricked an I.V.F. clinic, a judge and even her own husband. These deceptions left MaryBeth, who is now 68, potentially facing a yearslong prison sentence. She has lost her job and is barred from her children’s school. She has dropped nearly 70 pounds from the stress and cries herself to sleep at night. Over two years, MaryBeth has spent more than $500,000 fighting for her freedom and for custody of the twins who she maintains are her 14th and 15th children.\n\nThis spring, MaryBeth met me at a Tim Hortons near her home in Elma, N.Y., the same one where she buys doughnuts to decorate with frosting and googly eyes for children’s parties. It had been a long day. She left a new job early that afternoon to take her three youngest to the dentist, just one of the many appointments that fill her pocket planner. As the sun went down, the temperature outside dropped, and the ceiling vents exhaled sleepy, stale air. But MaryBeth was still buzzing with energy. She flashed a warm smile, as if greeting her son on the sideline of a soccer game with a bag of orange slices. After ordering a Diet Coke and finding a table, this ordinary woman sat down to explain her extraordinary legal troubles.\n\n“I felt bad, definitely,” MaryBeth said. “I felt bad because I did not feel good with what I did.” She drummed her nails on the table, and the sentiment she broadcast was less guilt than impatience. Finally, her frustration bubbled over. “This is bullcrap!” she said in a nasal Buffalo accent. “For what I did to get all these fricking felonies.”\n\nMaryBeth met Bob at a St. Patrick’s Day party in 1982, when she was a young nurse in the Air Force. He looked handsome in his green flight suit. She scribbled down her number. “After a while I thought, Well, why isn’t this guy calling me?” she says. MaryBeth called every Robert Lewis in the phone book until she found him. They married and joked that they would have a big family one day — maybe even 10 kids.\n\nOver the next decade, MaryBeth and Bob had their first five children, all girls. They bounced around the country as the Air Force sent him from California to Oklahoma to Texas to New Jersey to Tennessee. In 1998, Bob took a lucrative pilot job at FedEx, and the family moved back to Elma, near where MaryBeth grew up, and into a huge six-bedroom house they built for themselves in an affluent subdivision called Buffalo Creek Estates.\n\nThe family now had plenty of money, but MaryBeth stuck to simple pleasures: trips to the aquarium and the zoo, volunteering at the 4-H Club, ice-cream treats at Kone King and Catholic Mass on Sundays. Every Memorial Day, she made an American-flag cake decorated with strawberries and blueberries. She continued working as a nurse, favored sensible blouses and silver earrings and sang along to Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney in her minivan. MaryBeth was just a perfectly normal mother.\n\nBut something felt off. Bob was traveling half the month, and the girls were at school or busy with homework and friends. MaryBeth was often all alone in a quiet house. “This is empty,” she thought. “I don’t like this at all.” Now in her mid-40s, MaryBeth decided she wanted another baby.\n\nSo MaryBeth and Bob started trying again. Months passed, then years, with no success. She was determined, and the couple eventually “went into the infertility stuff” and created a batch of embryos through I.V.F. Many clinics will not implant embryos in women older than 45, but they found a chain called CNY Fertility that did not have an age limit.\n\nIn 2007, three weeks before her 50th birthday, MaryBeth gave birth to twin girls. The delivery almost killed her — she developed a rare blood-clotting disorder, required 21 units of blood and woke up on a ventilator. The doctors said it was a miracle she survived. But the babies were here, joining their older sisters who ranged in age from 13 to 23. MaryBeth was elated.\n\nSoon MaryBeth was pregnant again. In 2010, she gave birth to another daughter, her eighth. The East Aurora Advertiser, a Buffalo-area paper, ran a feature about the growing family. “Will there be any more little Lewises?” the reporter asked MaryBeth. She laughed. “No,” she said. “I have my hands full with these munchkins.”\n\nMaryBeth reveled in her second chance to be a mother of young kids. “I’m not one to just sit there,” she says. “I like to go, go, go.” She sold Thin Mints and Samoas for the local Girl Scout troop and choreographed elaborate Halloween parties. She raised great kids: Her oldest five daughters, who jokingly called themselves the Originals, collected graduate degrees and high-paying jobs; the younger ones later racked up academic scholarships and athletics trophies.\n\nFriends marveled at her stamina. MaryBeth’s calendar again filled with doctors’ appointments, gymnastics classes and birthday parties. In her free time, she somehow earned a doctorate in nursing. Bob was still gone more than two weeks a month. She didn’t care. When waitresses mistook her for Grandma, she just laughed. She was happy.\n\nSome of MaryBeth’s family members think she would have stopped there if her mother hadn’t died unexpectedly of a stroke in 2010. They had been inseparable. MaryBeth saw her at least four times a week and even fixed up a spare bedroom for her to move into when she became too frail to live alone. “My mom was my hero,” MaryBeth says. “She was an awesome lady. Always gave of herself. Kind. Gentle. Did everything for everybody else.” MaryBeth tried to follow in her footsteps as a parent. Her death was devastating.\n\n“I remember her calling me on the phone,” her friend Megan Eberl says. “She’s driving around aimlessly, just sobbing her eyes out.” MaryBeth saw a therapist and briefly had a prescription for Zoloft, the only mental-health issue that social-services investigators later reported finding.\n\nThat grief, her family now speculates, created a void in MaryBeth. Despite what she told The Advertiser, MaryBeth decided to implant more embryos. In 2012, at 55, she gave birth to twin boys — her ninth and 10th children. As she was being sewn up in the delivery room, a nurse rolled the bassinet into the hallway, and MaryBeth heard the Lewis girls scream with joy as they met their new brothers.\n\nMaryBeth still brimmed with energy. But as more children arrived, she needed help, and she leaned on her adult daughters. They obliged — and also began to worry. “We could never be 100 percent sure she was done having kids,” says Liz, her third daughter. “Because she’d say she was done, and then she’d be like, ‘Surprise!’”\n\nThe Originals figured that finally giving birth to boys was the capstone. “We just were like, ‘Oh, OK, that’s our family, that’s it,’” says Marissa, her fifth daughter. MaryBeth now had the 10 kids she and Bob once joked they’d have.\n\nBut the hole in MaryBeth’s heart was about to widen. Her second daughter, Kristina, had bipolar disorder and struggled with alcohol addiction. MaryBeth took home-cooked meals to her apartment and showered her with attention. Kristina in turn texted and called MaryBeth throughout the day, the only adult daughter who kept tugging at her apron strings. “Her and I were very, very close,” MaryBeth says. “Very close.”\n\nOne night in 2013, MaryBeth came home from dinner and found Kristina — who was then 26, sober and staying at the house while recuperating from an illness — passed out and unresponsive after a heart attack. MaryBeth performed CPR and revived her until the ambulance arrived. At the hospital, the doctor had shattering news. He showed MaryBeth a normal EEG and then an image of Kristina’s brain, which revealed significantly decreased activity.\n\nBut MaryBeth refused to give up hope. The family paid $80,000 to fly Kristina on a medevac plane to San Diego and then transport her via ambulance to Tijuana, Mexico, for experimental stem-cell treatment. The procedure led to little improvement, and she returned to a care facility in Buffalo. Doctors placed a stoma in her windpipe that allowed her to breathe. Her teeth ground down, and she contorted from seizures. For years, MaryBeth visited several times a week to paint her nails, pray the rosary and report family updates in her sing-song voice.\n\nKristina’s incapacitation “kinda broke her,” Liz says. “And she just needed to share her mother’s love with as many children as possible.” A newborn was the promise, says her seventh daughter, Isabelle, of “someone who wouldn’t leave her.” (Isabelle, Liz and Marissa requested to use their middle names to protect their privacy.)\n\nThey were yet more theories conjured by friends and family to explain why MaryBeth kept wanting more kids. Bob was sure the children made her feel young. Her friends saw a fear of loneliness — which she kept at bay with the intoxication of new motherhood. “Nothing’s better than a baby cuddling you in bed,” Eberl says.\n\nMaryBeth insists that it’s simpler than all that. Her childhood ritual with the dolls had grown into an existential purpose. “I think it’s because that’s where I got my love,” she says. “My children were my love, my blessings.” When Kristina died years later, a line in MaryBeth’s eulogy summed it up: “It was through her eyes that I was able to experience the innocence and splendor of life.”\n\nIn 2016, MaryBeth wanted another baby, but she was out of embryos. She bought donor sperm and donor eggs and created a fresh batch. The children would not be genetically related to MaryBeth or Bob, but that didn’t bother her. She would carry them herself and raise them as Lewises. She now worked at an OB-GYN clinic. Women 20 years her junior who were struggling to conceive looked on with shock when MaryBeth’s swollen belly greeted them in the exam room.\n\nThat December, MaryBeth gave birth to her third set of twins, the family’s 11th and 12th children. The new mother was 59.\n\nEven before her midlife journey into I.V.F., MaryBeth was already an outlier: Just 5 percent of American women have five or more children. But as she gave birth again and again, she joined an even smaller circle: Only 1,200 American women in their 50s gave birth in 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available. And most of those women were on the younger side of the decade. The federal government doesn’t publish birth statistics for women beyond the 50-54 age bracket. MaryBeth was pushing the furthest reaches of geriatric motherhood.\n\nMaryBeth’s friends started asking more questions. For years they had congratulated her with each new pregnancy, even as their own lives transitioned to doting on grandchildren and preparing to retire. “That’s what she wanted, and that’s what made her happy,” her friend Rita DeLotto says. But now their curiosity and alarm mounted. “If she’s that staunch of a Catholic, then if God was done having her have babies naturally, why not stop, rather than go this route of fertilizing?” asks her friend Mona Meagher. (The Catholic Church officially opposes I.V.F.) “Sometimes you get lonely,” MaryBeth once explained to Megan Eberl’s husband. He darkly joked: “Then have an affair.”\n\nOn Easter morning in 2019, MaryBeth and Bob gathered 11 of their 12 children in the foyer of their home. (Kristina was still in a care facility.) MaryBeth handed each of them a plastic egg. The Lewis children ranged in age from 2 to 35. When they cracked open the plastic, they all found the same note: “WE’RE EGG-SPECTING.”\n\n“I was really confused,” Marissa says. Was Pepper, the family’s goldendoodle, pregnant? No. MaryBeth, then 62, was carrying her 13th child.\n\n“All of us were shocked,” says Isabelle, who was 12 at the time. “The younger ones were excited. Us older ones were like, ‘This is not going to end well.’”\n\nLiz, then 31, was furious. For the Originals, the arrival of more siblings had gone from a joy to a stretch and finally to the breaking point. She felt increasingly pushed aside. Her sister Marissa had it worse: She lived at home during college to help with day care pickups, bath time and nighttime tears — and promptly failed her classes. A few of the older sisters even delayed having their own children in part to help MaryBeth. And now she had gone and unilaterally signed them all up for another tour of diaper duty.\n\n“What if you pass away before you think you will?” Liz asked MaryBeth, probing her mother’s awareness of her own mortality.\n\n“Well,” MaryBeth shot back, “what if you pass away?”\n\nLiz stormed upstairs, packed her bags and left before Easter dinner.\n\nLiz related this story to me with still-raw bitterness. But she followed up with a text message: Last winter, when Liz’s toddler was sick, MaryBeth dropped everything to meet them at an urgent-care clinic, went home to pack an overnight bag for the hospital, stayed with them in the emergency department, drove them home and then drove back to the hospital to retrieve something Liz had dropped in the parking lot. It was just one example of how far MaryBeth will go for her kids. “She’s not perfect, but none of us are,” Liz wrote. “She really, truly is a wonderful mom and human being.” MaryBeth is the kind of person who seeks forgiveness, not permission, and her children almost always oblige.\n\nIn the foyer, some of the children looked to Bob for guidance. He shrugged, with eyes that seemed to say, “What are you gonna do?”\n\nIn fact, the pregnancy surprised him too. MaryBeth had gone behind his back and secretly implanted two more embryos, with one taking. She had waited (and waited) until he was in a good mood, finally telling him at 12 weeks. “He originally signed for all this stuff,” she says, citing Bob’s purchase of the embryos three years earlier as tantamount to his consent. “But he wasn’t thrilled, let me put it that way.”\n\nWhere was Bob Lewis in all this? It’s the question that a county court, social workers and MaryBeth’s own defense attorneys would like to know.\n\nBob is a self-contained man. He is trim and balding, with watery blue eyes and a walrus mustache. Whether he’s waiting for a court hearing to begin or a server to bring the check, Bob folds his hands in his lap and tilts his chin skyward in prayerful forbearance. He had the same cool demeanor for thousands of hours in the cockpit of a C-141 cargo plane, ferrying troops overseas and bringing them home in flag-draped coffins. He kept that composure for an additional 22 years flying FedEx jets, slipping through inky black skies, waiting for runway lights to appear through the clouds.\n\nMarriage is a series of compromises — with your spouse and with yourself — and MaryBeth and Bob’s relationship was no different. She got 13 kids and a stream of little snuggle buddies in their California-king bed. “Whatever MaryBeth wants,” Bob once told Megan Eberl, “you can see MaryBeth gets.”\n\nBut Bob the introvert had gotten what he wanted too. Weeks at a time on the road in the monastic silence of the cockpit. Solo snaps of himself in front of the Sydney Opera House, the Eiffel Tower and the Acropolis. Nights at five-star hotels around the world, grazing at buffets and drinking beers, watching “movies with swearing” in beds with crisp sheets. A full family that required only part-time parenting.\n\nAnd for years it worked. Their marriage was the envy of friends. “Once, he came in from a trip — he still had an overcoat on — and changed a diaper,” Mona Meagher says. “Oh, my gosh, what a guy! Didn’t even take his coat off!”\n\nBut over time, even the occasional intersection of their parallel lives was too much to bear. The house in Buffalo Creek overflowed with kids’ toys, two refrigerators, two chest freezers and sneakers tumbling off a five-tier shoe rack. When Bob came home, he would shout and belittle MaryBeth about the mess.\n\n“My friends, oh, years ago, told me, ‘You need to get rid of him,’” MaryBeth says. She even consulted a divorce attorney. “But then he would leave on a trip, and everything was perfect without him.”\n\nIn 2020, when the pandemic hit, the bargain stopped working entirely. On the road, Bob was quarantined in foreign hotel rooms, trays of room service left outside his door. Back home, the county school system shut down, and the Lewis kids attended virtual classes. That November, Bob turned 65, the age at which commercial pilots must legally retire.\n\nBob adored the kids, including his surprise youngest daughter. But he wanted to spend his golden years traveling with MaryBeth. Instead, he was home-schooling five of his eight young children through a pandemic. “I didn’t retire to become a teacher,” Bob told her.\n\nAnd then in 2022, as the worst of the pandemic lifted, MaryBeth turned 65 — and felt a familiar urge.\n\nThe Lewises were still paying $50 a month to keep their last few embryos frozen at CNY Fertility in Syracuse. If born, those children would not be genetically related to MaryBeth and Bob, but they would be the full siblings of their three youngest children, as they all came from the same I.V.F. batch. It was easy for MaryBeth to imagine the sunny, bright kids these clusters of cells could become.\n\nEven couples who do not believe that an embryo is a human life can be uneasy about its destruction. Many pay the monthly fee to put off making a decision. And MaryBeth was a practicing Catholic. To remove them from liquid nitrogen and discard them, she felt, would be almost tantamount to murder.\n\nMaryBeth visited her OB-GYN and asked about implanting two more embryos. The uterine scar from her six C-sections was paper thin. Another pregnancy could rupture it and kill her. The doctor was adamant: No more babies.\n\nMaryBeth says Bob opposed donating the embryos to another couple because he didn’t want the genetic siblings of their three youngest children to be raised by strangers. (He doesn’t recall saying this but admits he has a bad memory.)\n\nBecause she couldn’t carry the embryos herself and wouldn’t give them away, MaryBeth says she had no choice. The only way to bring the children into the world was to use a surrogate. She contacted Rite Options, a surrogacy agency, which soon located a young woman in Steuben County who was interested in being a gestational carrier. MaryBeth also hired a New Jersey-based reproductive attorney named Melissa B. Brisman, whose professional letterhead was topped with the silhouette of a crawling baby, to handle the surrogacy contract.\n\nIf implantation was successful, the costs would be staggering. MaryBeth and Bob would pay $49,000 to the surrogate (plus a $7,000 bonus if two heartbeats were detected); cover her health and life insurance and attorney fees; pay a $3,500 hazard bonus if she required a C-section; and pay $200 a week for breast milk. All in, the process would cost more than $160,000.\n\nThe Lewises could afford it. In retirement, Bob took in $200,000 a year from two pensions and Social Security. MaryBeth still earned $92,000 a year as a nurse practitioner. They had $2 million in a 401(k) account.\n\nMaryBeth says Bob initially went along with the surrogacy plan. (He denies this.) Whatever Bob knew, he soon staked out a definite position: 13 kids were enough. His fellow retired FedEx pilots were on fishing boats in Florida; Bob still packed school lunches. He had a familiarity with cartoons like “Bluey” and “Cocomelon” better suited to a father half his age. The Lewises’ garage was a thicket of car seats, swim floaties and strollers. A party sign hung above the mess, mocking Bob: “HAPPY RETIREMENT.” Grandchildren were now arriving, and their third daughter, Liz, was considering having a child on her own. Bob and MaryBeth had promised to shower her with support if she did.\n\nIn their kitchen one evening, MaryBeth again brought up the embryos. Bob lost it. He screamed at MaryBeth, just inches from her face. “Destroy them!” he cried. “I don’t want to do anything with them!” Bob stormed off.\n\n“That’s when I got a little bonko,” she says.\n\nMaryBeth can justify what came next. “This goes against my religious beliefs,” she wrote in her journal of the embryos’ potential destruction. “We have gone so far and now he is yelling at me to destroy them and not even listen to my feelings/reasoning.”\n\nIn New York State, both spouses must sign off on surrogacy plans. Over the years, Bob had traveled so often that he let MaryBeth sign papers for him. “I got pretty good at his signature,” she says. He had eventually granted her power of attorney. Perhaps that covered a surrogacy contract too.\n\nWhen MaryBeth got to thinking about it, Bob had done plenty of things without consulting her. Big stuff, too, like buying a new truck and paying off their timeshare in Orlando, Fla.\n\nAnd what did he care, anyway? She was the one who raised their kids for 40 years while he flew around the world. She was the one who was going to raise these kids too.\n\nOn Feb. 13, 2023, MaryBeth stood at her dining-room table. On Page 23 of the gestational-surrogate agreement, above a signature line that read “Intended Father,” MaryBeth wrote in looping letters: ROBERT A. LEWIS. She later asked her brother-in-law to notarize the contract even though Bob wasn’t present.\n\nA month later, MaryBeth met the surrogate in Syracuse. She paid for fertility acupuncture, and MaryBeth got herself a massage. “It was kind of like a nice spa day,” she says. A technician at the I.V.F. clinic thawed two embryos, and in an exam room, a doctor gently transferred them to the surrogate.\n\nAnd then MaryBeth’s troubles began to grow.\n\nMaryBeth didn’t know how to tell Bob, and before long, she began to have second thoughts about deceiving him. Perhaps she wouldn’t have to: CNY Fertility had not given the embryos a high-quality rating; she assumed she would be lucky to have even one embryo stick. Sure enough, the surrogate soon began bleeding, a sign of a possible impending miscarriage. “I thought, OK, well, if she loses the baby, she loses him,” she says. “But I tried and whatever.”\n\nBut the surrogate did not lose the baby. And three weeks after the implantation, MaryBeth traveled to an OB-GYN appointment and let out a scream of joy as the ultrasound showed not one child but two.\n\nMaryBeth told no one. There were more papers to sign, more signatures to forge. Mixed with her anxiety was pure delight. Even though she had a basement full of hand-me-downs, MaryBeth ordered new baby clothes, car seats and a playpen. She wanted to feel the rush of new motherhood again. When Bob asked about the packages, she said they were for their daughter Liz, who was now pregnant herself.\n\nAll the while, MaryBeth kept trying to find a way to tell Bob. “There was many a time where I wanted to talk to him,” she says. “You have to hit him in a good mood in order to talk to him.” And Bob was as grumpy as ever.\n\nThere was an even more pressing issue. Four years earlier, when MaryBeth went behind Bob’s back to implant the embryos that resulted in their youngest daughter, no court needed deceiving. Like other states, New York considers the woman who gives birth to be the legal mother, and MaryBeth carried the child herself.\n\nBut now a surrogate was involved. And in 2021, New York passed the Child-Parent Security Act to legalize surrogacy and address the myriad issues that were likely to surface. MaryBeth and Bob would need to obtain a parentage order from a judge, which would officially transfer custody of the babies from the surrogate to them.\n\n“And I’m thinking: I’m way over my head,” she says. “Now what do I do?”\n\nOn Sept. 22, 2023, with the surrogate due to deliver in just eight weeks, MaryBeth logged onto a court hearing via Zoom. She told the judge that her husband was away on a work trip in Japan. She logged on with a separate account for Bob and kept the camera turned off. When the judge addressed him, MaryBeth says she grunted in assent.\n\nThe court she was trying to fool wasn’t in a big city, where such hearings have become so common that they are veritable rubber-stamp proceedings. MaryBeth’s surrogate lived in Steuben County, a sparsely populated, rural area south of the Finger Lakes. The region was once a thriving industrial hub, but it had slowly become part of the Rust Belt. The courthouse handled a grim caseload of sexual abuse and fentanyl trafficking. Expensive surrogacy cases there were almost nonexistent, and MaryBeth’s parentage petition stuck out.\n\nThe man she had to get past was Judge Chauncey J. Watches. He was a 19-year veteran of the bench, with a reputation for probity that suited his Dickensian name. And he was suspicious of the sexagenarian would-be mother before him.\n\nBefore the hearing, Watches ordered the county’s Department of Social Services to conduct a home study, a highly unusual move in a surrogacy case. He also appointed the unborn twins their own legal counsel, a local lawyer and judge named David Coddington.\n\n“I expect him to do his investigation so we can get a little more information about what is going on here,” Watches said at the hearing.\n\n“Would you mind if I asked what’s unusual?” said Melissa Brisman, the lawyer for MaryBeth and, as far as she knew, for Bob.\n\n“One thing, the ages of the parents: 66 and 67.”\n\nMaryBeth cut in: “Well, the fertility clinic had no problem.”\n\n“I’m not the fertility clinic,” Watches said. “I’m the judge.”\n\nRegardless of age, Brisman explained, her clients had followed procedure. Coddington agreed. “I mean, we give kids to grandparents all the time,” he said, addressing the qualms about their ages. And the Lewises were well off.\n\nThe judge’s hands were tied. He signed the parentage order. MaryBeth and Bob would soon be the legal parents of a baby boy and a baby girl.\n\nSix days later, MaryBeth was at work, examining a patient, when her phone rang. It was Bob.\n\nFor eight months, MaryBeth had made sure all legal correspondence was sent to a P.O. box. But the judge’s order was sent to their house. And Bob had picked up the mail.\n\n“What did you do?” he screamed.\n\n“Let me explain,” she said. She begged him again and again: “Let me explain. Let me explain.” Bob kept shouting.\n\nTheir four oldest daughters’ phones soon pinged. Marissa was in bed with her young son. Liz was five months pregnant. Bob had sent the group chat a photo of the parentage order and a message: “Look what your mother did.”\n\nAt home, Bob again read the paperwork, found the name of “his” lawyer and called Brisman’s New Jersey office. She in turn alerted Judge Watches. Then Bob called MaryBeth again.\n\n“I just reported you,” MaryBeth remembers him saying. Then he laughed. “You’re going to get arrested.”\n\nThe Lewis family erupted in recriminations. MaryBeth’s teenage daughters were the presumed front-line child care for the twins once they were born. “All of us were pissed,” Isabelle says, “because we knew we couldn’t handle another child, let alone two.”\n\nLiz spent years repairing her relationship with MaryBeth after the Easter pregnancy announcement in 2019. “And then this happened,” Liz says, “and it just completely shattered it again.” She was a single mother-to-be, with assurances from MaryBeth that she would help out. “I thought you were going to be this grandmother you said you wanted to be.”\n\nWhile the Lewis children raged at MaryBeth, nearly 100 miles away in Steuben County, the court rescinded MaryBeth and Bob’s parentage order. The Department of Social Services soon argued that the twins should be considered wards of the state.\n\nSocial Services laid out its case: The sperm and egg donors had waived their rights to any offspring. The surrogate, just weeks away from giving birth, did not want the children. Without a parentage order, MaryBeth was not their mother. In fact, they had no mother at all.\n\nScott Fierro, then a lawyer for the agency, concluded in a destitute-child petition: “Baby A and Baby B have (or will have) no parents under New York law.”\n\nAn investigator from the Department of Social Services soon visited Elma to conduct the home study that Judge Watches ordered. Eager to reassure the agency that she was a fit mother, MaryBeth painted a picture of relative domestic bliss. But Bob was still feeling raw, and he was blunt.\n\n“She wanted more children,” Bob said. “I didn’t.” He doubted that MaryBeth could care for the twins. Their marriage had been in crisis for a decade and was “over.” When MaryBeth learned about this last remark, she flatly told Bob, in front of the investigator, “I get half of everything then.” They did not make a sterling impression.\n\nBut Bob soon realized the enormity of his decision to report MaryBeth: ruinous legal fees, the potential breakup of his family. His life had one organizing principle. “For over 40 years, she’s pretty much gotten her way with anything she’s wanted from me,” he says. This would be no different.\n\nIncredibly, Bob now informed an agency investigator that he’d had a change of heart. “Just so you know MaryBeth and I have talked things over, and we have agreed in order to keep our family together I will request the children go to both of us,” he told the investigator. The couple even executed a new contract with the surrogate, which Bob himself signed this time, stating that they intended to be the parents.\n\nThe unborn children were still in legal limbo. But with Bob on board, MaryBeth was cautiously optimistic. She wanted to breastfeed the twins. She joined a lactation group on Facebook, through which she bought domperidone, a nausea medication not approved in the United States that has an off-label use for stimulating breast-milk production. When her supply came in, she pumped and froze the milk.\n\nThe surrogate was due on Nov. 26, but doctors induced her early. MaryBeth was desperate to be present for the delivery. When she got home from Walmart, Bob was adamant. He would watch the kids. “Go,” he said. “Go see our babies.”\n\nAs MaryBeth sped down the highway, she and the surrogate traded texts. Then her phone buzzed with photos: nurses weighing and measuring faceless nuggets wrapped in pink and blue blankets. MaryBeth began to cry — she had missed their births, and now the stress and uncertainty of the situation hit her all over again.\n\nBy the time MaryBeth arrived, news of the alleged fraud had beaten her to the hospital. After she left the maternity ward, she checked into a motel. The next day, MaryBeth sat in her room and dialed into an emergency court hearing. Her lawyer, Timothy J. Hennessy, made his case. Bob had agreed to raise the twins. The Lewis family had financial means. “I don’t know why the county is so hell-bent on bastardizing these children,” Hennessy said.\n\nScott Fierro, the Social Services lawyer, was having none of it. “We can’t just have crimes committed with relation to the creation of life,” he said, “and then have them get exactly what they wanted under that criminal conduct.” The twins were going home with two wonderful foster parents, he noted. “The place where the children are now does not have the criminal and civil liability baggage that applies to Ms. Lewis.”\n\nJudge Watches agreed. The twins would stay in foster care. He signed a temporary order of protection, barring MaryBeth and Bob from contacting the children. The next day, MaryBeth drove home with two empty car seats.\n\nThe East Aurora Advertiser once published a charming portrait of the growing Lewis family. But on Dec. 7, 2023, it ran a new headline: “Elma Resident Indicted for Attempted Kidnapping.”\n\nBrooks T. Baker, the district attorney, was stunned when he learned of the fraud. It was so bold, so meticulous. “We looked at it first and said, ‘Is this for real?’” he says. “It is such an off-the-wall collection of allegations.” But that shock soon hardened into the moral outrage shared by Judge Watches and Social Services. MaryBeth Lewis had done a terrible thing to the court, to her husband and particularly to two innocent children. She needed to be punished. Baker charged MaryBeth with 30 criminal counts, including forgery, falsifying business records and perjury. The attempted-kidnapping count was “a creative legal charge,” Baker says — and a reflection of just how disturbed he was by her actions.\n\nNow, MaryBeth says, “all crap broke loose.” The principal of her children’s school barred her from campus. The Girl Scouts booted her too. Buffalo State University, where she was employed at a medical clinic, asked her to work from home and later put her on unpaid leave. At home, the youngest Lewis kids cried often — they worried that she would go to prison.\n\nBaker soon offered a deal: Plead guilty to two felonies (and most likely lose her nursing license), serve no more than six months in jail and forfeit her rights to the twins.\n\nMaryBeth wanted to fight for her freedom — and for the twins. Her attorney in the custody case had already encouraged her to let the Department of Social Services keep the twins and try again the “right way” with new embryos. And now, after the indictment, her criminal lawyer advised her to accept the offer. “I’m not taking it,” she said flatly. “These are my children.”\n\nBaker offered a new deal. MaryBeth rejected it again. As the months passed, even after she stopped pumping and freezing breast milk, she performed small acts of hope. She swapped the newborn diapers for size 1s, and then those for size 2s.\n\nMost of the older Lewis kids rallied around MaryBeth. They couldn’t believe that the government would keep the twins from their parents. When Social Services investigators conducted their home study, they repeatedly asked Marissa about the younger Lewis kids: “How do you know these are your siblings?” It made no sense to her. “The kids either look exactly like my mom’s side of the family or my dad’s side, all of them,” Marissa says. MaryBeth’s children still didn’t know what was now in public court documents and on local news blogs: that she had used donor embryos and that her children were not all genetically related.\n\nIn June 2024, MaryBeth rejected a third plea deal. To pay her mounting legal bills, she raided her 401(k) account, maxed out three credit cards and took a stressful new nursing job. The couple’s tax hit for making the retirement withdrawals was staggering. Amid it all, her criminal lawyer quit, and Judge Watches declined to admit the new out-of-state counsel she hired. She had no legal strategy and dimming hopes.\n\nAll the while, MaryBeth wondered what the twins were like. The surrogate had told her that the boy had blond hair, the girl had brown. She was the smaller of the two. “Their cries were awesome,” she says. “That’s all I know.” Every night before bed, she prayed with her younger children and asked God to bring the babies home.\n\nWhat makes a woman a mother? MaryBeth’s case became a legal quagmire in part because everyone involved had a different answer — and visceral reaction — to that deceptively simple human question.\n\nThere is genetic motherhood: the woman who provides the egg from which an embryo is created. There is gestational motherhood: New research shows that the woman who carries the fetus, even if not genetically related, can influence eventual gene expression. And there is social motherhood: the woman who raises the child.\n\nMost mothers are all three. In cases of adoption or surrogacy, those roles can be divided between two or even three women. But MaryBeth was none of them. She shared neither DNA, nor her womb, nor her home, with Baby A and Baby B. To the local attorneys arrayed against her, MaryBeth wasn’t their mother. She was closer to a human trafficker.\n\nBut MaryBeth’s legal position was stronger than it appeared. I.V.F. custody disputes are almost as old as I.V.F. itself. An early clash was the 1993 case Johnson v. Calvert, in which a surrogate threatened to withhold the baby after giving birth. A California court issued a landmark ruling in favor of the child’s genetic parents, writing: “But for their acted-on intention, the child would not exist.” Ever since, courts have recognized the concept of intent as a tiebreaker in disputes between intended parents and surrogates.\n\nWhile MaryBeth was not the twins’ genetic mother, a paragraph buried in the state’s Family Court Act drew on that idea of intent to resolve troubled surrogacy agreements like hers, stating: “The court shall determine parentage based on the intent of the parties, taking into account the best interests of the child.” Bob had vouched that he wanted the twins. And even after all the deception, MaryBeth’s surrogate still wanted the twins to go to the Lewis home.\n\nMaryBeth had one more ace up her sleeve. When children were removed from their homes, the Family Court Act directed social services to place them with any existing genetic siblings. And MaryBeth and Bob’s three youngest kids hailed from the same batch of embryos.\n\nIn mid-2024, MaryBeth got a referral to a law office in Rochester, N.Y. Rhian D. Jones and Sarah E. Wesley, two of the lawyers there, smelled a great case. “I honestly couldn’t believe what I was hearing,” Wesley says. “It was one of those jaw-on-the-desk things.” The firm mostly handled violent felonies. But this was a novel case — a chance to create legal precedent. Wesley and Jones signed on to represent MaryBeth in both her criminal and family court cases, even capping their fees at $100,000 to give her a break.\n\nLast November, the two lawyers drove down to Steuben County for their first hearing in the custody case, parked Wesley’s white Mercedes S.U.V. in the courthouse lot and slipped into the back of the courtroom. They sat there unnoticed, listening to local attorneys gossip about MaryBeth.\n\n“She paid a lot of money to get these lawyers out of Rochester,” one of them said, mocking what seemed a futile attempt to resuscitate her legal defense and custody fight.\n\nWesley raised her hand. “Yeah, that’s us,” she called out. The courtroom went quiet. “We’re here.”\n\nWesley had initially maintained a healthy skepticism of MaryBeth’s conspiratorial depiction of Judge Watches. But now MaryBeth’s lawyers saw it too: a chummy, small-town courthouse that had become obsessed with keeping her from the babies. In the judge’s chambers, Wesley referred to MaryBeth’s faith as a motivation for her alleged fraud. Watches replied, speaking of her decision to use I.V.F., “If she was really Catholic, she wouldn’t have done this at all.”\n\nThe fixation on MaryBeth’s alleged crimes as a pretext for keeping the twins in foster care struck Wesley as absurd: All across the region, she had seen children returned to drug addicts and serial abusers. Even Brooks Baker, the prosecutor, admitted that it was an unusual situation. “In most of these cases,” he says, “it’s not a nurse and a pilot.”\n\nAnd then, as they pored over a year’s worth of court records, Wesley and Jones found what they believed was an obvious violation of due process: The parentage order had been revoked based on nothing more than a tip from MaryBeth’s lawyer, Melissa Brisman. She also most likely violated attorney-client privilege by contacting Judge Watches, Wesley says. (When asked to comment, Brisman responded by email: “At all times, my actions were consistent with my professional and ethical obligations to my former client and to the court as a fraud was committed upon my office.”)\n\nWesley now had a toehold. “You can’t just make a court order based on a phone call,” Wesley says. “He was just making up his own rules.” If the court had recognized the re-executed parentage order — the one signed by both MaryBeth and Bob — the twins would have gone home from the hospital with the Lewises, she points out. The whole mess could have been avoided.\n\nWesley felt a sense of urgency — every day the twins stayed in foster care would make relocation harder on them. On her Facebook Marketplace page, the foster mother listed used baby items: a bouncer that attached to a door jamb, an activity station. Little reminders of the formative time that MaryBeth had already missed.\n\nRather than file a time-consuming recusal motion or a judicial complaint, Wesley opted for a shortcut. A family friend, Thomas E. Moran, was an influential State Supreme Court judge based in Rochester. They met up, and she shocked him with the procedural errors in the case. Moran had a conversation with Watches. In April, Watches recused himself. (Watches declined to comment. A spokesman for Moran’s office told The Times that the judge is not permitted to comment on pending litigation.)\n\nThe scales now tilted back in MaryBeth’s favor. In May, Judge Matthew McCarthy began unwinding the court’s missteps. Down in Steuben County, the foster parents hired a lawyer and formally filed for adoption. They were eager to tell their side of the story, but confidentiality laws forbade it. “We sincerely hope your reporting will champion justice, uphold integrity and advocate for the protection of two very precious children,” the foster father wrote.\n\nAnd then, on Oct. 20, Judge McCarthy dropped the bomb: He officially recognized MaryBeth and Bob as the legal parents. Two weeks shy of their second birthdays, the twins obtained new names in court filings: Baby A Lewis and Baby B Lewis. The judge ordered the children to be transferred to MaryBeth and Bob’s custody.\n\nIn her text messages to me, MaryBeth was ecstatic: “I’m hoping now to get the babies ASAP!!!!!!!”\n\nOn the morning of Tuesday, Oct. 28, a heavy fog descended on Steuben County. MaryBeth and Bob wound their way through the mist to the courthouse. After two years of legal uncertainty, they hoped that somewhere on the other side of that darkness two children were waiting.\n\nIn the week since McCarthy’s parentage ruling, the opposing counsel had been busy. The twins’ court-appointed attorney had secured a last-minute, temporary stay from an appellate court. In Courtroom 6, Sarah Wesley was outraged. All the twins’ lawyer had done, she said, was delay the inevitable, eat up more time — and make the eventual handoff that much more devastating for the them. The attorneys traded barbs. “Stop the nonsense,” Bob’s lawyer, Jon Stern, said. “Start the reunification.”\n\nIt was the appropriate legal term, but it was also a misnomer. MaryBeth and Bob had never met the twins. Baby A and Baby B had only ever known one home. While lawyers argued over who their parents were, the twins already called two people Mommy and Daddy.\n\nThe foster parents sat next to their attorney in the courtroom. They were in their late 30s, well dressed and affable. The man was tall and broad-shouldered. The woman had blond curls and wore a long, billowy skirt.\n\nIn the hallway before the hearing, she had tried to project a sunny confidence. At night, she told me, the kids loved reading Eric Carle books, especially “Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?” “They’re at the point where they can read it to me,” she said. “So I get a bedtime story.” The twins’ second birthday was on Sunday. The foster parents had a party planned — that is, if they still had custody by the weekend. The woman’s smile fell away. She sat down on a bench and clasped her hands as if in prayer.\n\nJudge McCarthy gave every indication that MaryBeth and Bob were headed for victory. He ordered the Department of Social Services to open its case files to the Lewises. They would finally learn the twins’ names, which MaryBeth plans to change. He then scheduled the next hearing for late November. Bob raised his arms in frustration. MaryBeth shook her head. They would be waiting to meet the children for at least another month. The twins would have their birthday party in Steuben County after all.\n\n“It’s just terrible,” MaryBeth said in the parking lot, “what they have done to myself, Bob and our kids.” The Lewises were eager to get on the road. They had a lot to do back in Elma: dropping girls off at gymnastics classes, returning a Halloween costume to the store, making spaghetti dinner. And at some point, Bob had two cribs to assemble.\n\nMaryBeth still had pending criminal charges, but her lawyers were confident they would strike a deal that avoided jail time. In quiet moments, she entertains the possibility that she made some mistakes. But a crystal clarity always returns. She plucked the twins from a frozen, celestial limbo and put them on this earth. She gave them life. How could she ever regret this? “I saved these embryos from being destroyed,” she says. “I saved my children.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Isabel Hodges-Lewis.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/article/track-runners-nyc-marathon.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"13:50:01-04:00","title":"How to Track Runners in the New York City Marathon","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article provides comprehensive information on how fans can track and watch the New York City Marathon in real time using the NYRR app or online tools.

He estimated that President Trump’s decision to lower tariffs on Chinese products would save him roughly $30,000 in tariff costs on a shipment the company has coming in from China this week — enough to perhaps hire another seasonal employee in the small Washington town where Cocoon is based.\n\nBut the tariff deal came with a downside. Cocoon had begun shifting some production to India this spring to avoid high tariffs on China. But in the past few months, Mr. Trump has raised tariffs on India by 50 percent, while dropping tariffs on Cocoon’s Chinese goods to 30 percent, scrambling the company’s plans.\n\nMr. McMaster lamented the time he had spent on building up production in India. At least for the time being, he said, “I’m not going to spend any more energy trying to get out of China.”\n\nAfter a chaotic year of tariff threats and trade deals, the United States has landed, at least temporarily, in a surprising situation. In the face of a potentially devastating trade clash with China, Mr. Trump agreed to cut in half a 20 percent tariff he had used to punish China for its role in the flow of fentanyl.\n\nThat has pared back U.S. tariffs on certain Chinese products to levels that are nominally near or sometimes below those he has put on products from other countries, including some allies like Switzerland, India, Brazil and Canada. According to calculations by the Yale Budget Lab, the average effective tariff on Chinese goods has risen by 20.2 percentage points this year, compared with 17.3 percentage points for the rest of the world.\n\nNot every company pays the same tariff, and other calculations that include earlier tariffs on China indicate a higher overall rate. Chad P. Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute, has calculated an average tariff rate for China of 47.6 percent, but it is not clear how that compares with U.S. tariffs on other countries.\n\nCompanies that rely on doing business with China have been grateful for the tariff reduction, even as they scramble to parse what the latest deal means to them and how long it will last. Some economists and executives argue that the outcome may slow the move by companies to find alternatives to China, potentially complicating a longer-run effort by U.S. officials to reduce America’s dependence on Chinese supply chains.\n\nMany companies remain intent on diversifying where they source their products and are cautious about tying their fortunes to China over the longer term. Yet the current system of tariffs removes some of the urgency for companies to find factories outside China. It also chips away at the economic advantage that companies had expected from moving factories to Brazil, Vietnam and India.\n\n“There isn’t a great incentive, if this is the final tariff structure, to reallocate out of China,” said Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. He argued that the tariff differential between China and other countries was much smaller now than Mr. Trump had suggested in his 2024 campaign, when he proposed putting a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods and a 10 to 20 percent tariff on products from the rest of the world.\n\n“Contrary to what many in the administration are saying, they haven’t ended up with a tariff structure that really encourages relocation out of China,” Mr. Setser said.\n\nThe Trump administration disputed that idea, saying that its national security tariffs — which impose taxes on products like auto parts, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors — would disproportionately affect China. Officials also argued that the administration was focused on ending China’s chokehold on other products, like rare earths.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had pledged to end “America’s foreign reliance by reviving domestic manufacturing and industry.” The trade deals and trillions of dollars in investment commitments “prove that the Trump administration’s trade and tariff policies are delivering on this pledge,” he said.\n\nChina’s ability to retaliate appears to be one reason that the country is not facing more severe tariffs, as India and Brazil are. Mr. Trump has threatened repeatedly to put triple-digit tariffs on China, but Beijing responded by hitting back at the United States where it hurt. It created a system to regulate the export of rare earth minerals and clamped down on those shipments, threatening to shutter U.S. auto plants and other factories.\n\nThe strategy worked. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, walked out of negotiations with lower fentanyl-related tariffs than countries like Canada, which have tried to placate Mr. Trump.\n\nAfter a meeting in South Korea last week, Mr. Trump agreed to pause new fees on Chinese ships and delay sanctions on thousands of Chinese companies, in addition to cutting a 10 percent tariff. China said it would suspend the rollout of certain rare earths restrictions for a year and return to buying U.S. soybeans. It also said it would crack down on shipments of the chemicals used to make fentanyl.\n\nSean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said companies viewed the agreement as “a very strong step forward, giving some certainty and some predictability to to what’s happening in the U.S.-China relationship.” He agreed, however, that the deal might lessen the incentive for companies to find alternatives to China.\n\nHe said many companies have found that “in no place has it been possible to replicate the manufacturing ecosystem and cost efficiencies that you get in China.\" The instability and unpredictability of where tariffs might land in other markets had made companies “doubly hesitant about expanding supply chain networks outside of China,” he added.\n\n“At the beginning of the Trump administration, there was a very clear sense that there was going to be a lot of pressure for companies to move supply chains out of China,” Mr. Stein said. “But at this point, that pressure hasn’t materialized.”\n\nIn the wake of last week’s agreement, Mr. Trump will have added a 20 percent tariff to all Chinese imports so far this year. That includes the 10 percent fentanyl tariff and another 10 percent tariff that Mr. Trump said is directed at slowing the flow of Chinese imports into the United States.\n\nA portion of Chinese imports also face an additional tariff of 7.5 to 25 percent left over from Mr. Trump’s first-term trade war. Chinese products are also hit by Mr. Trump’s global tariffs on industries like autos, steel and aluminum, as well as pre-existing tariffs from the World Trade Organization, and Chinese goods qualify for fewer tariff exclusions than many other countries’.\n\nAlthough U.S. tariffs on Chinese products are high, American tariffs on certain products from other countries are now sometimes similar or higher, for reasons that make little sense.\n\nFor example, Mr. Trump has imposed a 10 percent “reciprocal” tariff on exports from Britain and Australia, now the same reciprocal rate as for China. The administration says that tariff is directed at offsetting the U.S. trade deficit, but the United States runs trade surpluses with both Britain and Australia, while it racked up a nearly $300 billion trade deficit in goods with China last year.\n\nThe United States also runs a trade surplus with Brazil. But Mr. Trump has put a 50 percent tariff on goods from Brazil and India, amid spats over Brazil’s treatment of a former president and India’s refusal to credit Mr. Trump in making peace with Pakistan. Mr. Trump has also imposed a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in response to the country’s trade surplus with the United States, even though much of that recent trade has been gold bullion that investors have imported to hedge against tariffs.\n\nCanada, America’s closest ally, faces a 35 percent tariff that Mr. Trump imposed in part because of his claim that Canada is a significant source of fentanyl for the United States. While in practice many goods coming from Canada are exempted through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the nominal rate is still much higher than China’s 10 percent fentanyl tariff, despite far more fentanyl coming from China than Canada.\n\nCountries in Southeast Asia, where many companies have moved their factories after leaving China, typically now face a reciprocal tariff of 19 or 20 percent, the same as or slightly lower than the base line tariff on China. But economists said countries like Vietnam and Cambodia could be heavily affected by the administration’s plans to put an additional tax on goods that are made with a certain proportion of Chinese content.\n\nFor many companies that have spent years planning an exodus from China, an overall tariff reduction of 10 percent on goods made in China is not big enough to lead to any sudden strategic changes. Companies also remain wary that the U.S. trade truce with China could quickly crumble, as it has before.\n\n“Ten percent isn’t quite enough to move the needle,” said Cameron Johnson, a supply chain consultant in Shanghai. He said many of his clients are still waiting to see how things play out when Mr. Trump meets with Mr. Xi again in China next year.\n\n“There is a bit of skepticism about whether this will hold. You’re not going to move your factory or production for six months and a 10 percent reduction,” Mr. Johnson said, referring to a comment Mr. Trump made last week about visiting Beijing in April.\n\nCompanies, particularly larger ones, have found ways to weather the volatility in the U.S.-China relationship by diversifying their supply chains through partnerships with factories in neighboring countries like Vietnam, or setting up their own factories outside China. Across southern Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City, dozens of sprawling new industrial parks have popped up amid the influx of demand for a factory alternative to China.\n\n“I don’t think you’ll see companies moving out of Vietnam, India and elsewhere to go back to China. It’s the big number that actually matters,” said Adam Sitkoff, the executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.\n\nBut many smaller companies have not had the resources to diversify their supply chains. The truce between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi will provide some relief for firms that are too small to negotiate new factory deals in other countries and depend on Chinese factories for highly technical work.\n\n“It’s a strange moment of celebration,” said Patrick Soong, whose Portland, Ore., firm, Allitra, helps American companies find manufacturers in Asia. Referring to the recent agreement to cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, he said, “Ten percent is not nothing and it’s effectively made China 10 percent cheaper for all of our customers.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/world/sam-sifton-new-york-city-marathon-dodgers.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:54:37-05:00","title":"The New Host of The Morning","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The author, a lifelong New York City native, reflects on how growing up with The New York Times in Brooklyn shaped his deep appreciation for journalism.

Prosecutor’s Office in Crisis\n\nPublished: 2025-11-02T05:00:52-05:00\n\nUnder the vaulted arches of the National Union Building, a group of federal prosecutors gathered recently for what has become an all-too-common ritual: saying goodbye to colleagues.\n\nThe speeches that night reflected the despondent mood inside the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, as the lawyers who were quitting urged those staying behind to forge ahead in uncertain times. Do what’s right, they said. Speak truth to power. Uphold the rule of law.\n\nBut as the hour grew later — and the bar tab bigger — the politics that have buffeted the office for months suddenly intruded on the evening, people who were there recounted later. In a quiet corner, away from the charcuterie and veggie dip, Jonathan Hornok, a top aide to Jeanine Pirro, the Trump appointee picked to run the office, was firing Jon Hooks, a senior prosecutor who had worked there for nearly 20 years.\n\nThat a respected supervisor with a long career could be stripped of his job in the middle of a farewell party for his colleagues captured something of the Darwinian tumult that has wracked the prosecutors’ office since President Trump returned to the White House and set about remaking the Justice Department in his image.\n\nFederal prosecutors’ offices in New York, California and Virginia — to name just a few — have felt the effects of Mr. Trump’s desire to root out those he believes have been disloyal and to wield the criminal justice system against his enemies. But nowhere, perhaps, has the impact been as palpable as the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, which is deeply enmeshed in the workings of the government and has long attracted Mr. Trump’s vengeance for having filed criminal cases against him and his allies.\n\nThe office is in crisis, distrustful of its leadership and demoralized by waves of dismissals, demotions and resignations that have slashed its head count by as much as a third since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, according to more than a dozen current and former employees, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive issues.\n\nJust last week, two prosecutors were placed on leave hours after seeking a stiff sentence for a pro-Trump rioter who was pardoned for his role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and who later showed up armed near the house of former President Barack Obama. In a bizarre move, Mr. Hornok personally filed new sentencing papers scrubbed of any mention of Jan. 6 or Mr. Trump.\n\nThe departures have fallen particularly hard on the office’s fraud, public corruption and civil rights unit, which has lost nearly half of its prosecutors as well as Mr. Hooks, its former chief, and three of its former supervisors. That has damaged the office’s ability to make the big-ticket white-collar cases it has long been known for.\n\nThe loss of talent has also affected the office’s other core mission — protecting public safety — which Mr. Trump and Ms. Pirro have both made a priority. The president’s decision to send the National Guard and federal agents onto the streets of Washington has led to a rush of cases, and while prosecutors have helped to drive crime down, they have also gotten significant pushback from juries, grand juries and judges.\n\nAt the same time, those familiar with the office said, Ms. Pirro, a longtime Trump supporter, has begun to quietly accelerate a list of what are known in the office as special projects touching on subjects that have piqued the president. Those initiatives, including investigations into people and issues reviled by Mr. Trump, have heated up after Lindsey Halligan, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, indicted two of the president’s foes.\n\nThe intense politicization of the office has dismayed former prosecutors like Gregory Rosen, who worked there for a decade, rising to oversee the Jan. 6 investigation before quitting earlier this year.\n\n“The growing influence of political considerations has disrupted what was once a remarkably cohesive institution,” Mr. Rosen said, “and it’s the career people who now bear the brunt of that.”\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, praised Ms. Pirro’s work, saying she had returned to public service to “make America safe again.”\n\n“In a short period of time, she has turned a broken system on its head and shown that the Trump administration will hold criminals accountable,” Ms. Jackson said.\n\nWhen current and former prosecutors talk about the office these days, the same few words are used to describe the mood: fearful, battered, beleaguered, exhausted.\n\nThat is in large part because the office has been on the front lines of the legal battles surrounding Mr. Trump since the end of his first term. The turmoils of today rest on scars from cases as far back as five years ago.\n\nAfter the office convicted Roger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump’s longtime adviser, of lying to and obstructing Congress, senior Justice Department officials recommended a much lighter sentence than the one rank-and-file prosecutors had suggested, prompting all four to quit the case in protest.\n\nProsecutors also obtained a guilty plea from another Trump aide, Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. But then the department dropped the case, effectively erasing Mr. Flynn’s admissions to lying to the F.B.I. about talks with a Russian diplomat in late 2016.\n\nMonths later, the office found itself at the center of an even more consuming Trump-related maelstrom: the investigation of the Capitol attack. Over the next four years, prosecutors brought charges against nearly 1,600 rioters, winning the vast majority of the cases but encountering a farrago of conspiracy theories from the defendants and Mr. Trump himself.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected to a second term, one of his first acts was to issue a sweeping grant of clemency to every charged rioter — a move that landed inside the office like a gut punch. He quickly dealt a second blow, installing Ed Martin, a loyalist who had worked for years on behalf of the rioters, to run the office as interim U.S. attorney.\n\nWithin days of Mr. Martin’s arrival, the firing and reshuffling began. They have not stopped. .\n\nEven as Mr. Martin presided over retributive personnel moves, he also started sending menacing letters threatening an array of Trump opponents with investigation. In his second month, Denise Cheung, the chief of the office’s criminal division, quit after Mr. Martin opened an inquiry into grants issued by the Environmental Protection Agency during the Biden administration.\n\nMs. Cheung’s resignation not only drew attention to Mr. Martin’s willingness to pursue political cases, but also deepened the office’s leadership vacuum. To replace Ms. Cheung, Mr. Martin brought in Mr. Hornok, a narcotics prosecutor from Texas who had little knowledge of the office’s inner workings.\n\nStill, Mr. Martin put him in charge of a new anti-crime program intended to crack down on gun violence in Washington. As Mr. Martin wrote in an email, prosecutors would begin pursuing every firearms case referred to them and seek pretrial detention against every defendant.\n\nThe program would eventually contribute to the eroding relations between the prosecutors’ office and the courts — and with the community. But Mr. Martin was adamant it was needed.\n\n“We will flood the federal district court with cases to make our city safe,” he wrote.\n\nOf the 93 U.S. attorneys’ offices from New York to the Northern Mariana Islands, the one in Washington is unique. It is the only one that handles both federal and local crimes.\n\nMost of the office’s 300 or so prosecutors are assigned to superior court, where local crimes are tried, and office veterans pride themselves on having been through the “rotation” — the process of sorting through police reports to determine which arrests to prosecute.\n\nBut even though Mr. Martin intended to beef up prosecutions of street crimes, he was gone within weeks of his program starting. In May, after his nomination to run the office on a permanent basis failed, Mr. Trump replaced him with Ms. Pirro, a former district attorney in Westchester County, N.Y., who made a post-prosecutorial career as a brash-talking Fox News host.\n\nAfter the five chaotic months under Mr. Martin, many in the prosecutors’ office welcomed Ms. Pirro. Though she was known to be an ardent Trump supporter and a scene-chewing television personality, she at least had experience as a prosecutor.\n\nIn her first month on the job, Ms. Pirro earned the respect of her subordinates with her tough yet measured appearance at a news conference announcing the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy workers outside the Capital Jewish Museum.\n\nHer words played well with the office’s hard-charging, law-and-order types, though some saw in her remarks a glimmer of her performative past. A witticism began to make the rounds. It was obvious, people in the office said, that Ms. Pirro cared deeply about crime victims. It was also obvious that she cared deeply about people knowing she cared deeply about crime victims.\n\nTensions started building in August as the U.S. attorney’s office was thrust into a leading role in Mr. Trump’s reinvigorated plan to quell local crime with troops and federal agents. Ms. Pirro and Mr. Hornok, who had never been through the “rotation,” tried something new, current and former prosecutors said: They ordered lawyers to be on duty more or less around the clock, in position to receive calls from agents or police officers in the middle of the night.\n\nAlready facing a staff shortage, Ms. Pirro brought in 20 military lawyers to work on cases related to the surge. Even so, much of the work found its way to prosecutors who had worked on fraud or national security cases and were unfamiliar with street crime.\n\nStill, Ms. Pirro made clear she wanted an aggressive approach to local crime, instructing prosecutors to bring as many cases as possible not in superior court but in federal court, where penalties are generally stiffer, according to people familiar with the moves.\n\nSome prosecutors said that, in an effort to get charges into court quickly, they were ordered to forgo the traditional process of evaluating cases for possible search or seizure violations. Any such problems, they said, could be dealt with later, after the cases had been put in front of judges.\n\nTimothy Lauer, Ms. Pirro’s spokesman, pointed to her successes, including having driven murders and carjackings down nearly 70 percent since the surge began over the summer.\n\n“This office needs warriors, not worriers,” Mr. Lauer said. “Being a prosecutor isn’t a popularity contest — it’s about prosecuting crime and protecting victims.”\n\nStill, the consequences of the surge have begun to show up in the courtroom.\n\nIn a highly unusual development, grand juries in late August started to reject requests to return indictments, suggesting that the ordinary citizens on the panels believed the cases were problematic. Within a month, it happened nearly a dozen times, including in the case of Sean C. Dunn, who became a local folk hero of sorts after hurling a submarine sandwich at a federal agent.\n\nIn another case, prosecutors failed three times to obtain an indictment against Sidney Lori Reid, who was accused of assaulting an agent while protesting an immigration arrest. Even after they dropped her felony charge to a misdemeanor, they still failed to make the case. After a series of prosecutorial errors, Ms. Reid was acquitted at trial.\n\nJudges have taken notice.\n\nEspecially vocal in his criticism has been Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui, who once worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office. In recent orders, Judge Faruqui has complained about misuse of grand juries, defendants languishing in jail and the number of cases his former colleagues have dismissed.\n\nIn August and September alone, he determined, prosecutors filed 95 cases by criminal complaint, requesting that 20 of them be dismissed. That was the same number of dismissals requested out of the more than 4,000 cases charged by complaint between 2014 to 2024.\n\nThis “roller coaster,” as Judge Faruqui called it, has made some prosecutors in the office anxious that they might soon be asked to do something unethical. Some have gone so far as to strip their personal offices down to bare bones, preparing for the day when they might have to leave at a moment’s notice.\n\nFrom the moment Ms. Pirro arrived, some of those under her believed she was intent on ascending to a more important post. During Mr. Trump’s first term, for instance, she had lobbied unsuccessfully to be deputy attorney general.\n\nIn the Trump-era Justice Department, where loyalty is prized above all else, one clear path to promotion lies in doing the president’s bidding. In September, Ms. Halligan went from being an obscure White House aide with no prosecutorial experience to the key Virginia U.S. attorney post.\n\nWithin three weeks, she had rejected the advice of career staff members and secured indictments against two of Mr. Trump’s adversaries: James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general.\n\nCurrent and former prosecutors in Washington said that Ms. Pirro had put pressure on her staff to bring similar cases, creating a group to work on the so-called special projects. Those, they said, include investigations into the Metropolitan Police Department’s use of crime statistics and into the financier George Soros, who has long been a boogeyman on the right for his support of liberal causes. There was also interest, the prosecutors said, in re-investigating aspects of the Jan. 6 riot and in scrutinizing the lawyer Norm Eisen, who has repeatedly challenged Mr. Trump’s efforts to expand his powers.\n\nIt remains unclear where those inquiries stand, and if they will eventually result in criminal charges.\n\nBut Ms. Pirro’s desire to see them through was serious enough that it led to pushback from Mr. Hooks, the former chief of the fraud and public corruption unit, according to several colleagues. Mr. Hooks was uncomfortable with moving forward on some of the cases and told Ms. Pirro weeks ago that he planned to resign.\n\nBefore he could quit, however, he was fired — at the going-away party for his colleagues.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-campaign.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:04:27-04:00","title":"Andrew Cuomo, Scraping and Scrambling, Is Still Running as Andrew Cuomo","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrew M.

Cuomo, tieless but never casual, was making a familiar point in an unfamiliar place.\n\n“You know, government is supposed to function,” Mr. Cuomo, the 67-year-old mayoral candidate, told Logan Paul, the 30-year-old influencer-wrestler-bro, seated recently in a luxury hotel room between at least six bottles of Paul-branded energy drinks and two Paul-branded snack packs. “It’s not a debating society.”\n\nThe host had something to add.\n\n“EYOOOOOOOOOO.”\n\nSuddenly Mr. Paul was shouting, transition-less, at his great many podcast listeners, smash-cutting to a prerecorded ad break about professional wrestling merch.\n\nThirty-two seconds later, Mr. Cuomo had the floor again.\n\n“There was a great senator, Ted Kennedy, God rest his soul …”\n\nThere was a governor, Andrew Cuomo, God rest his decade ruling Albany, who would have sooner traveled the state by Winnebago with Bill de Blasio, his sworn nemesis, than submit to the sundry humiliations of the modern underdog campaign.\n\nNow, straining to catch Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in the closing stages of this mayoral race, Mr. Cuomo has shown far more hustle than he did in his languid primary bid — sitting with seniors and shock-jocks, semi-smiling for cellphone selfies, play-grabbing the shoulders of men with silver hair who said they remembered his father.\n\nHe has embraced schlocky A.I.-generated advertising to depict Mr. Mamdani as a secondary character from the Austin Powers franchise; adopted a high-pitched voice to play the role of New Yorker Grateful for Andrew Cuomo’s Construction Projects as Governor (“This is nice! We did this! I feel good about New York!”); commended Mr. Paul for his feats in hydration commerce (“I’m going to bring some bottles with me”).\n\nWhat Mr. Cuomo has not done, what former aides have long said he is incapable of doing, is change.\n\nTo see him up close in the campaign’s final frames — pressing, pleading, seeing what sticks, calling his opponents meritless hacks and unbridled zealots while lamenting the bygone civility he ascribes to the less-than-utopian New York of his 1970s adolescence — is to see a man betting that this city has not changed as much as others seem to think it has, either.\n\n“Our city,” he thundered last weekend in Queens, standing atop a flatbed truck draped in hybrid American-Israeli flags. “Our city.”\n\nAnd doesn’t everyone remember? Don’t they remember when he was younger, when we all were, when he was in charge? Don’t they remember that New York — where he was feared and respected and feared and ascendant and feared and inevitable and occasionally beloved?\n\nThere is a reason his remarks lately have drifted toward a verbal slide show about his decades in public life:\n\n“When I was H.U.D. secretary …”\n\n“When I was governor …”\n\n“I go out into the briefing room — CNN, live …”\n\nHe has made it plain that his chief regret about any behavior that led to his resignation as governor is that he resigned.\n\nHe has issued increasingly foreboding warnings about “that young man” before audiences who worry, too, that a victory for Mr. Mamdani would signal the end of something for them.\n\n“He is an extremist!” Mr. Cuomo said in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, looking out on a crowd of yarmulkes and a MAGA cap or two.\n\n“Who’s the oligarch?” Mr. Cuomo asked at a senior center in Harlem, speaking beside a headshot of Barack Obama as older Black voters urged him on. (Mr. Cuomo’s $4.9 million in income last year did not preclude his hyping Mr. Mamdani’s family wealth.)\n\n“This election is a choice,” he told a business group in Midtown, “between capitalism and socialism.”\n\nYet for him, the race remains less a choice than a referendum: Andrew Cuomo or not Andrew Cuomo; unlikely redemption or another unwanted retreat.\n\nAides and allies used to invoke an iron rule of Cuomo scholarship: Since his failed first campaign for governor in 2002, he had resolved to never again risk such embarrassment, arranging to run only in elections he viewed as virtual certainties.\n\nThat he abandoned that principle after his stunning primary defeat in June is as instructive as anything, those who know him say — the crackling id behind everything he is saying and doing to reverse that recent history before it can happen again.\n\n“He lives for political power,” Frank Seddio, a former Brooklyn Democratic chairman who has known Mr. Cuomo since the 1970s, said after the two campaigned together in southeast Brooklyn last week. This was a compliment.\n\nAnd so, with some polls tightening and Mr. Cuomo’s rhetoric unbound, his last days on the trail have felt at times like a collective spasming of the old guard — or a proper countermovement, admirers hope — as a new would-be political order threatens their grip and his relevance.\n\nOutside his event with Mr. Seddio, Cuomo supporters and backers of Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, bickered on the sidewalk between a Chinese takeout spot and a vape shop, before agreeing that they should all probably leave the city together if Mr. Mamdani wins.\n\nIn Queens, hats and signs specking an outdoor crowd of more than 100 seemed as good a marker as any of Mr. Cuomo’s closing messages: “Ready on Day One.” “Mamdummy.” “Don’t Kvetch. Vote.”\n\nThere and elsewhere, Mr. Cuomo has spoken often of his father, Mario M. Cuomo, who, like his son, won three terms as governor. He suggested the elder Mr. Cuomo, who died in 2015, would not recognize a New York that elected Mr. Mamdani.\n\n“He sheds a tear,” Mr. Cuomo said, “that we need to be here.”\n\nThe younger Mr. Cuomo can likewise sound flabbergasted at his current lot — the Democratic son of a Democratic stalwart sitting for a Fox News interview as a third-party challenger with an I-for-independent identifier on the chyron, emphasizing his own fiscal discipline in a triple-bank-shot bid for conservative votes.\n\nAt nearly every appearance, though, he continues to argue he is the true Democrat.\n\n“I didn’t change,” Mr. Cuomo told Mr. Paul, noting that he was once caricatured as a “crazy liberal” and is now considered a moderate. “The planet shifted.”\n\nMr. Cuomo’s spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said that the campaign had course-corrected after a lackluster Democratic primary effort without altering the fundamental political product on offer.\n\n“We’ve never tried to sell him as anybody but himself,” he said. “Wouldn’t be right to the voters.”\n\nWhat has changed most is what Mr. Cuomo seems willing to put up with, at least in the interim.\n\nHis relative media blitz in recent weeks — after Mr. Mamdani’s success with an everywhere-all-at-once strategy in the primary — has compelled Mr. Cuomo to navigate the sort of unwieldy interactions he once tended to avoid.\n\nHe has laughed along with a right-wing radio host who said that Mr. Mamdani would cheer another 9/11-style terrorist attack on New York City.\n\nHe has smiled tightly through a procession of unflattering questions from the women of “The View”:\n\n“Why aren’t you doing better?” (“Yeah, good question.”)\n\n“Why are you losing to a democratic socialist?” (“It is a very good question.”)\n\nWhat of the sexual harassment allegations? (“It’s a good question.”)\n\nOther stops have been more comfortable for him.\n\nLast week, Mr. Cuomo visited an office building on Park Avenue to address the Association for a Better New York, a business group, and deliver some attendant reminders.\n\n“Remember Amazon!” Mr. Cuomo said, recalling left-wing opposition to the company’s planned corporate campus in Queens years ago.\n\n“A.O.C.,” an attendee whispered gravely to her seatmate in the back. (Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a high-profile supporter of Mr. Mamdani, helped lead the backlash against Amazon.)\n\nIt was a room full of people whom Mr. Cuomo had known and teased and sometimes thrilled and often tormented, people who knew him when he was permitted to thrill and to torment with civic impunity.\n\nThe session was moderated by Steven Rubenstein, the association’s chairman and the son of Howard Rubenstein, the New York public relations titan who died in 2020. Mr. Rubenstein asked Mr. Cuomo how he planned to negotiate governing partnerships amid complicated relationships across Washington and Albany.\n\n“Love,” Mr. Cuomo deadpanned. “Give love, get love, circle of love.”\n\nThis, understandably, was a laugh line.\n\nBut as he outlined the future he imagined, Mr. Cuomo lingered on the New York he remembered.\n\nHis father and Mr. Rubenstein’s father had “made this place,” Mr. Cuomo said. This was their city.\n\n“I will be damned,” he vowed, “if Steven Rubenstein and Andrew Cuomo are going to leave their children a New York that is anything less than they inherited.”\n\nAnd if he was wrong about all that — about what his city thought it needed; about what awaited New York if he lost; about what awaited him — that was not something that Mr. Cuomo seemed ready to contemplate yet.\n\n“I’m afraid for New York City,” he said. “And I am New York City.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/world/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-death-toll.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"00:27:05-04:00","title":"Death Toll Rises From Hurricane Melissa as Many Communities Remain Cut off","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The death toll from Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica has risen to 28, with nine additional fatalities confirmed since the previous count of 19.

Is Deciding Who You Are\n\nPublished: 2025-11-02T09:00:05-05:00\n\nImagine applying for a job. You know you’re a strong candidate with a standout résumé. But you don’t even get a call back.\n\nYou might not know it, but an artificial intelligence algorithm used to screen applicants has decided that you are too risky. Maybe it inferred you wouldn’t fit the company culture or you’re likely to behave in some way later on that might cause friction (such as joining a union or starting a family). Its reasoning is impossible to see and even harder to challenge.\n\nIt doesn’t matter that you practice safe digital privacy: keeping most personal details to yourself, avoiding sharing opinions online and prohibiting apps and websites from tracking you. Based on the scant details it has of you, the A.I. predicts how you’ll behave at work, based on patterns it has learned from countless other people like you.\n\nThis is increasingly life under A.I. Banks can use algorithms to decide who gets a loan, learning from past borrowers to predict who will default. Some police departments have fed years of criminal activity and arrest records into “predictive policing” algorithms that have sometimes sent officers back to patrol the same neighborhoods.\n\nSocial media platforms use our collective clicks to decide what news — or misinformation — each of us will see. In each case, we might hope that keeping our own data private could protect each of us from unwanted outcomes. But A.I. doesn’t need to know what you have been doing; it only needs to know what people like you have done before.\n\nThat’s why privacy can no longer be defended one person at a time. As we adapt to living with A.I. as a larger part of our lives, we need to exert collective control over all of our data, to determine if it’s used to benefit or harm us.\n\nBack in the 2000s, as concerns around digital privacy rose, computer scientists built a privacy-protection framework called “differential privacy” that could protect individuals’ identities while still collecting data to learn about users’ patterns more broadly. Algorithms that use differential privacy work by adding a tiny bit of randomness to the data so no one can identify who exactly is in the data, all without changing the overall results.\n\nThese protections mean people might be more willing to share their data with third parties, and these differential privacy algorithms are now quite common. Apple iPhones are built with these algorithms to collect information about user behavior and trends, without ever revealing what data came from whose phone. The 2020 U.S. census used differential privacy in its reporting on the American population to protect individuals’ personal information.\n\nYet the patterns in the data remain — and they’re enough to guide powerful actions. The technology company Palantir is building an A.I. system called ImmigrationOS for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to identify and track people for deportation by combining and analyzing many data sources together (including Social Security, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Internal Revenue Service, license plate readers and passport activity) — getting around the obstacle posed by differential privacy.\n\nEven without knowing who any one person is, the algorithm can likely predict the neighborhoods, workplaces and schools where undocumented immigrants are most likely to be found. A.I. algorithms called Lavender and Where’s Daddy? have been reportedly used in a similar way to help the Israeli military determine and locate targets for bombardment in Gaza.\n\nIn climate change, one person’s emissions don’t alter the atmosphere, but everyone’s emissions will destroy the planet. Your emissions matter for everyone else. Similarly, sharing one person’s data seems trivial, but sharing everyone’s data — and tasking A.I. to make decisions using it — transforms society. Everyone sharing his or her data to train A.I. is great if we agree with the goals that were given to the A.I. It’s not so great if we don’t agree with these goals; and if the algorithm’s decisions might cost us our jobs, happiness, liberty or even lives.\n\nTo safeguard ourselves from collective harm, we need to build institutions and pass laws that give people affected by A.I. algorithms a voice over how those algorithms are designed, and what they aim to achieve. The first step is transparency. Similar to corporate financial reporting requirements, companies and agencies that use A.I. should be required to disclose their objectives and what their algorithms are trying to maximize — whether that’s ad clicks on social media, hiring workers who won’t join unions or total deportation counts.\n\nThe second step is participation. The people whose data are used to train the algorithms — and whose lives are shaped by them — should help decide their goals. Like a jury of peers who hear a civil or criminal case and render a verdict together, we might create citizens’ assemblies where a representative randomly chosen set of people deliberates and decides on appropriate goals for algorithms. That could mean workers at a firm deliberating about the use of A.I. at their workplace, or a civic assembly that reviews the objectives of predictive policing tools before government agencies deploy them. These are the kinds of democratic checks that could align A.I. with the public good, not just private power.\n\nThe future of A.I. will not be decided by smarter algorithms or faster chips. It will depend on who controls the data — and whose values and interests guide the machines. If we want A.I. that serves the public, the public must decide what it serves.\n\nMaximilian Kasy is a professor of economics at the University of Oxford and the author of “The Means of Prediction: How AI Really Works (and Who Benefits).”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2025-11-02T05:01:22-05:00\n\nWhen President Trump said he would enact sweeping tariffs and crack down on immigration, dire warnings rang out in the construction industry.\n\nThe policies threatened to push up building costs and deprive the industry of a crucial pool of labor when high interest rates were already depressing building activity.\n\nThose forces are converging on builders, weighing them down in a potential drag on the economy. Higher import taxes on steel, copper, lumber and other materials are lifting construction prices and interrupting some jobs. Immigration enforcement is worsening worker shortages and delaying projects.\n\n“We get so many things thrown at us in the construction industry,” said Tony Rader, the chief relationship officer at National Roofing Partners, a commercial roofing company in Coppell, Texas. “It just seems like every time we turn around, we’ve got something else to fight.”\n\nThe rising costs and understaffing could impede the momentum the industry is expected to derive from lower interest rates, economists say. The effects could be most pronounced in the housing industry, where elevated mortgage rates have discouraged homeowners from moving and dragged down sales.\n\nMr. Rader said tariffs on products from China had pushed up the cost of screws, plates and other supplies. Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, had agreed to a one-year deal to reduce the overall tariff on many Chinese goods by 10 percentage points, to around 47 percent.\n\nThe possibility that immigration agents could target job sites has made some employees reluctant to come to work even though they are in the country legally, he said. He said one of his subcontractors had missed out on a roofing project near the U.S.-Mexican border this year because he could not field a crew of workers.\n\nHis clients are also worried about uncertain pricing and the possibility that staffing issues could affect construction jobs. Some have delayed putting on expensive new roofs, he said, and have asked instead for maintenance plans on existing ones. His revenue is shrinking, and he is looking for ways to cut spending. He is budgeting for slower growth next year.\n\nMr. Trump has imposed tariffs on a wide range of materials and foreign-made products that the construction industry needs. In addition to levies on steel and other metals, tariffs ranging from 10 to 50 percent on foreign timber, lumber and wood products like kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities went into effect last month.\n\nThe tariffs are meant to encourage more domestic manufacturing. But so far, that has not been the case.\n\nThe complicated nature of supply chains means that it will take time for companies that buy materials from abroad to shift gears. It is also unclear whether foreign suppliers, American companies or consumers will shoulder the extra costs — and how much prices will rise for consumers.\n\nEarlier this year, the National Association of Home Builders estimated that tariffs would inflate the cost of building a typical home by $10,900. Prices on construction materials have risen 2.3 percent from a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Iron and steel prices are up 9.2 percent year over year, and copper wire and cable have increased 13.8 percent.\n\nJustin Wood, an owner of Fish Construction NW, which builds starter homes in Portland, Ore., said tariffs on lumber, drywall and heating equipment had pushed up his construction costs $2,500 to $3,000 a home.\n\nThe increase has been manageable, he said, because the homes he builds are meant to be small and affordable — they are usually between 1,000 and 1,200 square feet and cost about $250,000 to build.\n\nMr. Wood said he was concerned about the price of lumber from Canada, which is subject to a combined tariff rate of up to 45 percent. A lumberyard that he uses is looking into acquiring more American lumber, he said, but may not succeed.\n\n“If they’re not able to source what we need locally, then they may have to buy it from Canada, and that may ultimately be a price increase from the lumber side of things,” he said.\n\nMr. Trump’s immigration policy is also taking a toll.\n\nConstruction this year added just 6,000 jobs through August. One analysis found that the industry would require nearly half a million more workers this year to meet projected demand.\n\nAt the same time, the industry’s unemployment rate fell to 3.2 percent, equaling its record low. Those two data points suggest that the supply of available workers has decreased.\n\n“The current immigration policies are putting huge stress on the work force,” said Michael Bellaman, the chief executive and president of Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group that endorsed Mr. Trump last year. “There’s no doubt that that is problematic.”\n\nA survey conducted in July and August by another trade group, the Associated General Contractors of America, found that more than a quarter of respondents had been affected by Mr. Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nThe Pew Research Center has estimated that undocumented workers made up 13 percent of the construction industry in 2022. Companies are supposed to verify that their direct employees are in the country legally, but they often outsource work such as roofing, tiling and painting to subcontractors that make their own hiring decisions.\n\nAndrew Kaye, a luxury homebuilder in Milltown, N.J., said the presence of immigration agents in Newark seemed to scare away some workers for a few days. “There was a ripple effect,” he said.\n\nImmigration agents also recently targeted a home in the Chicago area where construction workers were replacing windows and siding. The raid sent a chill through the neighborhood, said Leo Feler, an economist and the home’s owner.\n\n“This construction project is now stopped,” he said. “I think construction in this entire neighborhood is now stopped because everyone is so fearful.”\n\nThe effects of the administration’s policies may become more visible in the months ahead. Many of the most punishing tariffs have been in place only since August, so they have not had time to work their way through the economy. Exporters and suppliers may also be hesitant to pass on price increases if they think the United States will negotiate trade deals or the tariffs will be struck down in court.\n\nElevated rates, and the resulting pullback in demand for construction, could be reducing the squeeze of higher costs and fewer workers.\n\nConstruction spending has been fading since spring 2024, even with a rush of spending on data centers. New home construction in August fell 6 percent from a year earlier and is well below its pandemic-era peak.\n\nIf interest rates continue to fall, suppliers will have more leverage to pass on costs to customers. With immigration enforcement depleting the supply of available immigrant workers, companies racing to staff projects would find themselves in steeper competition for employees, driving up wages.\n\n“We’ve already seen some challenges, both in terms of the cost of materials being driven higher and now the labor shortages being exacerbated by deportation policies,” said Selma Hepp, the chief economist at Cotality, a real estate data provider.\n\nBut she added, “I think we haven’t seen the worst of it yet.”\n\nSteve Martinez, the president of Tradewinds General Contracting, a homebuilder in Boise, Idaho, has been tacking a larger contingency cost onto budgets for clients to mitigate potential tariff-related price increases.\n\nFor now, his expenses have not gone up as much as he predicted, which he largely attributed to the slow pace of new home construction. He said he expected to build just seven of the high-end custom homes that are his firm’s specialty this year, down from 10 to 12 usually.\n\n“The demand is not there, and so we haven’t quite seen the price escalation that we all envisioned or assumed we would see overnight,” Mr. Martinez said.\n\nHe hopes lower interest rates will reverse the housing industry’s slide. But he also worries that stronger demand will end up amplifying the impact of the administration’s policies.\n\n“Had we been really busy, I think we would have felt it a lot quicker,” he said.\n\nBen Casselman contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/us/politics/trump-boat-attacks-war-powers.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"21:34:31-04:00","title":"War Powers Law Does Not Apply to Trump’s Boat Strikes, Administration Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House and Justice Department have asserted that President Donald Trump’s lethal drone strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific do not constitute 'hostilities' under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, thereby justifying the continuation of the operation beyond the 60-day limit.

2025-11-01T21:34:31-04:00\n\nThe Justice Department told Congress this week that President Trump could lawfully continue his lethal military strikes on people suspected of smuggling drugs at sea, notwithstanding a time limit for congressionally unauthorized deployments of armed forces into “hostilities.”\n\nIn a briefing, the official who leads the department’s Office of Legal Counsel, T. Elliot Gaiser, said the administration did not think the operation rose to the kind of “hostilities” covered by the 60-day limit, a key part of a 1973 law called the War Powers Resolution, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn a statement provided by the White House, an unnamed senior administration official said that American service members were not in danger because the boats suspected of smuggling drugs were mostly being struck by drones far from naval ships carrying U.S. forces.\n\n“The operation comprises precise strikes conducted largely by unmanned aerial vehicles launched from naval vessels in international waters at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,” the official said.\n\nThe U.S. military has killed about 62 people across 14 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific so far, and the administration has told Congress that Mr. Trump “determined” that the operation counts as a formal armed conflict.\n\nBut the stance that the operation does not count as “hostilities” because the people on the boats could not shoot back builds on a precedent established by President Barack Obama during the 2011 NATO air war over Libya, to significant disagreement at the time in Congress and within Mr. Obama’s own legal team.\n\nThe War Powers Resolution says that a president who unilaterally deploys U.S. forces into hostilities “shall terminate” the operation after 60 days if Congress has not authorized it by then. But the legislation left the term “hostilities” vague.\n\nUnder that law, the clock starts no later than when a president submits a required 48-hour notice to Congress. President Trump notified Congress about the first strike in his operation on Sept. 4, meaning the 60th day will arrive on Monday. That timing had raised the question of whether he would stop or, if not, how he would justify continuing the operation.\n\nWhen the White House, Pentagon and Justice Department were asked that question by The New York Times last Wednesday, the administration provided a general statement that did not clarify. But Mr. Gaiser laid out the administration’s position in briefings to lawmakers and some staffers last week. His comments were earlier reported by The Washington Post.\n\nThe statement from the unnamed official also argued that “even at its broadest,” the War Powers Resolution “has been understood to apply to placing U.S. service members in harm’s way.” And it pointed to two past Office of Legal Counsel opinions discussing military deployment issues — one from a Republican administration and one from a Democratic one.\n\nOne memo, from 1984, contained a paragraph discussing what “hostilities” might mean, though it did not take a position. It observed that a House report about the War Powers Resolution had said that term should be interpreted as encompassing a danger of armed conflict, not just combat. It also noted that the Ford administration had argued that “hostilities” referred to a situation in which U.S. armed forces were “actively engaged in exchanges of fire.”\n\nThe other memo, from 1994, was about President Clinton’s authority to unilaterally deploy peacekeeping troops to Haiti. It did not discuss the 60-day limit.\n\nThe statement did not cite the Obama-era Libya precedent on the 60-day pullout law — which, while the closest historical analogue, did not lead to an opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel. The office’s top lawyer at the time did not agree with the theory Mr. Obama had embraced.\n\nOther lawyers on Mr. Obama’s team had come up with that theory. But their argument that the war over Libya did not amount to “hostilities” was based on more than the idea that there was little risk of U.S. casualties, because there were no ground troops and Libyans could not shoot back. The Obama team’s argument also cited other constraining factors that are absent from Mr. Trump’s boat attacks, including that the Obama-era operation was a NATO-led multilateral mission to carry out a United Nations Security Council resolution.\n\nBy expanding on that precedent, Mr. Trump is more deeply entrenching the idea that the 60-day limit does not apply to air wars. That is an important development for the history of a law that presidents of both parties have chafed at over the past half century.\n\nCongress passed the War Powers Resolution near the end of the Vietnam War, after decades in which presidents from both parties had used the large standing armies left in place after World War II to send troops into combat without congressional authorization. The bill contained a package of measures intended to wrest back Congress’s intended constitutional role in deciding when the United States would go to war.\n\nPresident Richard M. Nixon vetoed it, calling it an unconstitutional intrusion on his authority as commander in chief. But Congress overrode the veto, so it became law anyway.\n\nSince then, however, some parts of the legislation have eroded.\n\nFor instance, the law says presidents may deploy the military in hostile situations only with prior congressional authorization or if the country is under attack. Every subsequent president since Mr. Nixon has exceeded that limit, treating the provision as too narrow to be constitutional. Congress has acquiesced by not impeaching any president for doing so.\n\nAnother part of the law said Congress could order a president to immediately end an operation through a kind of resolution that presidents cannot veto. That clause was effectively struck down in 1983 when the Supreme Court ended so-called legislative vetoes of executive actions, saying that Congress could only legally act by passing measures that presidents could veto.\n\nBut the part of the legislation that created the 60-day window has fared better. (The law allows presidents to extend that period by up to 30 days if they certify to Congress that extra time is needed to withdraw U.S. forces safely.)\n\nIn 1980, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in the Carter administration produced a memo declaring that it was constitutional for Congress to impose a 60-day limit. Subsequent administrations have left that memo in place as the official legal interpretation of the executive branch, and it remains on the office’s website.\n\nFor the most part, the 60-day clock has not been an issue, for three reasons.\n\nFirst, numerous one-off strikes and short-term interventions ordered by presidents without congressional authorization have ended before reaching 60 days. Second, Democratic and Republican administrations have argued that the law should not be interpreted as applying to ambiguous types of operations, like peacekeeping missions with only intermittent fighting, or naval operations to protect shipping lanes.\n\nAnd finally, presidents have obtained congressional authorization for major wars, such as the Persian Gulf war, the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and against Al Qaeda and its progeny.\n\nStill, along the way, lawyers for some administrations — especially Republican ones — have suggested that the 60-day clock might be an unconstitutional limit on the commander in chief’s power. To date, though, no president has acknowledged that the law applied to a particular military operation that lacked congressional authorization and kept that mission going past the deadline by asserting a constitutional right to override the statute.\n\nOther administrations — mostly Democratic ones — have come up with narrow interpretations of the statute to argue that they could lawfully continue certain military operations beyond its apparent deadline.\n\nIn 1999, President Bill Clinton directed the United States to participate in a NATO-led air war over Kosovo, including past the 60-day mark. Congress never explicitly authorized the operation, but before the deadline arrived, it passed a spending bill that provided funding for it.\n\nThe Clinton legal team argued that the spending bill counted as authorization, even though the War Powers Resolution said that providing funding for troops already in the field could not count as granting permission. But the Office of Legal Counsel opined that a past Congress could not constrict future lawmakers in how they chose to authorize an operation.\n\nA similar situation arose in 2011, when Mr. Obama directed the United States to participate in a NATO-led air war over Libya that ended up lasting more than 60 days. Congress had not passed a spending bill for the operation, but, for policy reasons, Mr. Obama did not want to halt or scale back American participation before the war was over.\n\nThe Obama legal team was internally divided about whether the law required the president to ratchet back U.S. contributions to the operation anyway. But one faction came up with a theory that Mr. Obama had the authority to continue the military campaign without changes because American involvement fell short of “hostilities.”\n\nMr. Obama embraced that argument and kept going, weathering significant criticism.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/world/canada/blue-jays-dodgers-world-series-canada.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"03:44:56-05:00","title":"Canadians Mourn a Loss by Underdogs Who Brought a Nation Together","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Toronto Blue Jays, despite losing the 2025 World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a thrilling 11-inning Game 7, became a symbol of national unity in Canada during a time of strained U.S.-Canada relations.

Brought a Nation Together\n\nPublished: 2025-11-02T03:44:56-05:00\n\nThis October, the World Series was played outside the United States for the first time in 32 years. Shortly after midnight, the Commissioner’s Trophy, having made a brief trip to Canada, was heading home with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue 5-4 in 11 innings to win the World Series in a thrilling Game 7, breaking the heart of a whole country that had rallied around the team during its own season of discontent with the United States, its once close ally.\n\nA World Series that most Americans predicted would be over in four games — starring Canada’s only Major League Baseball team against the blue chip Dodgers, with baseball’s biggest payroll at $520 million and best player in Shohei Ohtani — delivered everything but a championship for the Blue Jays.\n\nAlong the way, the underdogs became known as the “Glue Jays” for their camaraderie and power in uniting fans across the country as the team ran through the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners.\n\nOn Saturday, the Rogers Center in Toronto, holding nearly 45,000 fans, was bedlam most of the night.\n\nThe Blue Jays chased starting pitcher Ohtani from the mound after he gave up a three-run home run to Bo Bichette. A spectacular diving catch in center field by Daulton Varsho followed by another at first by Vladimir Guerrero Jr., saved at least two runs. The dugouts and bullpens cleared for some pushing and shoving after the Toronto batter Andrés Giménez was hit by a pitch. Guerrero executed a risky double play to perfection. A home run by Miguel Rojas of the Dodgers in the ninth inning tied the game 4-4. Then, a solo home run by Will Smith of the Dodgers in the 11th inning stunned the crowd, and the Blue Jays could not match it.\n\nOn a clear, crisp November night in Canada’s largest city, Jays fans watching in jammed bars drifted despondently onto the downtown streets. The Rogers Centre crowd, who applauded the Blue Jays as they left the field, couldn’t bear to watch as the Dodgers piled onto it.\n\n“As tough as this is right now, I think of the entire country and how they latched onto this group and hung on every pitch just like we did and there’s going to be so many good memories for generations of Blue Jays fans that waited a long time to get here,” the Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. “To the fans I say thank you, and to the fans I say sorry.”\n\nGeddy Lee, the lead vocalist and bassist for the rock band Rush, has been a season-ticket holder since 1979. He said the makeup of the team — a mix of stars like Guerrero and George Springer, and more than a dozen players with recent minor league stints and some prospects — engaged Toronto baseball fans and roused so many Canadians.\n\nToronto finished last in the American League East in 2024, and early expectations for this year had been low.\n\n“This is the most surprising team I can remember in all the years I’ve been following them,” Lee said in an interview with The New York Times before Game 7. “They got on a roll and you wondered, is this really happening? It snowballed and turned all those negative expectations into a love affair.”\n\nThe Blue Jays have one Canadian player — the charismatic, hard-slugging first-baseman Guerrero, who was born in Montreal while his father was playing for the Expos. He arrived at the stadium on Saturday wearing the jersey of Canada’s women’s hockey team captain, Marie-Philip Poulin, and he put it back on after the loss.\n\nMost of the Blue Jays players are from the United States or Latin America, and yet as a group they emit a distinctly Canadian spirit. They’re likable. They’re loose but tight-knit. They play with joy. They take winning seriously, but not themselves.\n\n“There doesn’t seem to be a lot of arrogance and Canadians identify in that regard. Proudly quiet and self effacing. Maybe that’s how we connect to them,” Lee said. “They’re quiet yet persistent and they seem to have no quit in them and Canadians like to see that in themselves.”\n\nHe called the Blue Jays “a unifier.”\n\nThe Jays’ third baseman Ernie Clement called it “a privilege” to serve in that role.\n\n“I have had zero negative interactions with anyone in this entire country since I’ve been here, which is just mind-blowing to me,” said Clement, who is from Rochester, N.Y. “Everyone has just been so cool and nice and welcoming and so supportive. It is truly an honor to play for this country.”\n\nSince the spring, the Blue Jays have been a Xanax for a nation pulled unwillingly into tense relations with the United States over tariffs and President Trump’s threats to Canada’s sovereignty. On the eve of Game 1, Trump said that he was terminating trade talks with Canada over an ad taken out by the Ontario government that Trump said misrepresented Ronald Reagan’s words on tariffs from a radio address he gave in 1987. Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada apologized to Trump for the ad.\n\nBut unlike when the tariffs were announced, national anthems were respected and routinely cheered during the World Series. In one clumsy moment that may or may not have been political, in the middle of Game 6 on Friday, a man carrying a bunched up American flag jumped over the outfield wall but was quickly tackled by security guards and arrested by the police. For the most part, all Canadians wanted to talk about was the Blue Jays. Tensions stayed on the ball field.\n\nFor the first time in the history of Major League Baseball, the season began and ended abroad — in Tokyo and Toronto. Fittingly, an international audience tuned in — the opening game had a combined viewership of 32.6 million in Canada, Japan and the United States, the largest since the Chicago Cubs’ championship that ended their 108-year drought in 2016.\n\nLee said he had heard from many American friends “who are secretly rooting for the Blue Jays.”\n\n“The numbers this World Series is doing not only in Canada, but everywhere, is unbelievable,” said Bichette, the Jays’ infielder. “I even had to kind of take a step back and be like, dang, this is pretty cool.”\n\nThe biggest moments: Addison Bargers’ pinch-hit grand slam for the Blue Jays in Game 1, the first in World Series history. The Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s complete Game 2. An 18-inning Game 3, the second longest in World Series history. Toronto’s shutdown of Ohtani on the mound and in the batter’s box in Game 4. The Blue Jays rookie pitcher Trey Yesavage’s seven-inning masterpiece — with 12 strikeouts, a World Series rookie record, in Game 5. A wild ninth inning in Game 6 that saw a stuck ball likely cost the Jays the game. And in Game 7, heartache.\n\nJoe Carter, who hit the home run that won the Jays their last World Series in 1993 knows what the Blue Jays can mean to a country.\n\n“If you close your eyes and swing hard and hit a home run, they will love you for the rest of your life, not just here in Toronto,” Carter said. “You can go from as far east as Nova Scotia and as far west as Vancouver and it was all about the Blue Jays. It was all about Canada.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/us/los-angeles-celebrates-dodgers.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"09:46:29-05:00","title":"In a Dark Year, Los Angeles Basks in the Dodgers’ Glow","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of a difficult year marked by the Eaton wildfire and federal immigration raids, Southern Californians turned to the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series victory as a source of communal joy and resilience.

the night sky with fireworks. They celebrated in homes on the edges of burn scars. They hugged in suburban bars where protests rattled the windows just months ago.\n\nAs Southern Californians watched the Los Angeles Dodgers power through 11 innings on Saturday to beat the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series, an impromptu party erupted with a catharsis and joy that was about more than baseball — a celebration not of only excellence, but of the will to endure.\n\nSouthern California has been through a grueling year that included disasters that devastated Pacific Palisades and nearby Altadena in January and federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement crackdowns. In an interview during the first inning of Saturday’s game, Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said that she was hoping intensely for a victory that would bolster morale in her city.\n\nA win by the Dodgers would mean a parade and civic celebration on Monday, she said, honoring the team’s second championship in two years.\n\n“I want to see 200,000 people out in the street, celebrating peacefully, having a good time,” she said. “The Dodgers are part of our DNA, and the city has been on pins and needles. Given the year we’ve had, we can use this burst of adrenaline, this burst of good will.”\n\nAcross Southern California, fans echoed her yearning. From the South Bay to the Valley, from the Westside to the Eastside, as the song goes that is now the Dodgers’ anthem, Southern Californians talked about their relief at the normalcy of toasting their team in a neighborhood bar that had not been leveled, or at sharing a civil chat.\n\nThere was the reminder — for one night, at least — that an American place that had lost so much in so many ways might still be a land of champions. Back to back.\n\nAn eight-foot-wide map of the burn zone flanked the patio entrance outside Good Neighbor Bar in Altadena. Children scrambled on top of stumps repurposed from trees felled by Santa Ana winds and fire, while their parents and neighbors nearby sipped beers. Over the fence, sunset lit up the San Gabriel Mountains, still denuded in spots 10 months after the Eaton fire.\n\nAt this bar, reminders of the devastation from January are all around. But the drama of Game 7, and the Dodgers’ championship run overall, made everyone forget, at least for a little while.\n\nBarnabas Lin, 38, a doctoral student from Pasadena, wore a brand-new Dodgers cap. “It’s been a hard year,” he said. “I just bought the hat. I don’t think I would have bought it if it wasn’t this year.”\n\nAfter the bar opened its patio this summer, it became a gathering place for locals and displaced Altadenans. The owners, Randy Clement and April Langford, stayed behind after the fire and connected with people through the bar’s Instagram page to let them know whether their homes were still standing.\n\nOn this night, they celebrated the Dodgers, but also the community. Still standing.\n\nWhen the Dodgers won, fireworks erupted across the street. Lovers kissed. Babies cried. Dogs howled.\n\nLiz Yoshonis, 37, a therapist from Pasadena, summed it up: “Communal effervescence.”\n\nAt Gladi8or Pizza & Billiards in East Los Angeles, scores of fans packing the bar area chanted, “Let’s go, Dodgers!” Many wore jerseys bearing the names Ohtani, Smith and (Kiké) Hernández on their back. And one sentiment seemed to be shared by all.\n\nThey needed this — being together.\n\nThe federal immigration raids have targeted hundreds of people in this predominantly Hispanic region of the city. And it seems everyone in the area knows someone who has been affected.\n\nThis year has been “really rough,” said Miguel Morales, 48, who was at the bar with his wife, Sandra Lara, 44, and their 11-year-old son, Angel.\n\nBut cheering for the Dodgers “gets us back to being civil again, enjoying something, celebrating something,” Ms. Lara said.\n\nThe franchise has a fraught history with the Chicano community here, dating back to when the largely Mexican communities known collectively as Chavez Ravine were displaced to make way for an affordable housing project that was aborted and later became Dodger Stadium in 1959.\n\nMs. Lara said she can’t quite forget that the Dodgers came under fierce criticism this summer for failing to take an explicit stand against the ICE raids that targeted the Dodgers’ huge Hispanic fan base. The team’s management did refuse to allow ICE agents access to the ballpark’s parking lot for staging.\n\nBut the team ultimately rallied the city, including East L.A. “It always just gets everybody together,” Ms. Lara said. “They haven’t held us down, the government, our president, whatever it is. We still celebrate, we still cheer, we still hang strong.”\n\nThree miles northwest of Gladi8or, cars honked in support of the Dodgers as the vehicles sailed down a usually quiet residential street of the Boyle Heights neighborhood in East Los Angeles. The air was filled with the sounds of Game 7 blasting from speakers. The game was being projected from the driveway of a home onto a municipal water tower across the street.\n\nA crowd of at least 40 people, neighbors, family, friends and strangers — who were welcomed and fed — gathered under a large tent in the driveway and lined the sidewalk.\n\nA few years ago, Misael Morales, 39, projected a movie onto the tower. Last year, he decided to try it with the Dodgers when they made it to the World Series. Now, it has all the makings of a tradition.\n\nMr. Morales’s wife, Esmerelda Rodriguez, 42, beamed as she handed bowls of teriyaki beef and vegetables to anyone who came by.\n\n“I love this country. I’ve had so many opportunities here, even though it has its ups and downs,” said Ms. Rodriguez, who came to the United States at 18 and became a U.S. citizen in 2012. She immediately became a Dodgers fan when she arrived in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen the Dodgers tied the game in the ninth inning, the cheers could be heard down the street. Fireworks started popping off nearby.\n\nAnd after the Dodgers won, Ms. Rodriguez said it was more than just a game. It was a boost to the morale of the entire Hispanic community of the city.\n\n“It’s such a light,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/world/europe/uk-train-stabbing-huntingdon.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"08:06:16-05:00","title":"Police Arrest Two British Men in Stabbing Rampage on Train","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two British men, aged 32 and 35, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following a stabbing rampage on a London-bound train that injured 11 people, four of whom have been discharged from the hospital while two remain in life-threatening condition.

over as host of The Morning, The Times’s flagship newsletter, which more than five million people read each day. He’ll guide us through what’s happening in the world. He’ll be a companion through troubling stories, piercing criticism, poignant profiles, great listens and every other bit of wonder this news organization produces.\n\nI’ve discovered, working with Sam this fall, that he’s a delightfully idiosyncratic dude. You should know about him! Since he came to The Times in 2002, he’s had seven extremely varied jobs. Among them:\n\nHe was the restaurant critic, from 2009-2011. (Ask him about his workout regimen to keep fit between all those meals.)\n\nHe was National editor, overseeing one of our largest news desks, through the Boston Marathon bombing and other big stories.\n\nHe basically invented NYT Cooking, a site so many of us have come to rely on. It’s the first place I turn when I panic: What do I do with these parsnips I found at the market? (Answer: Sam’s riff on seafood chowder.)\n\nFor the last five years, he has overseen all our culture and lifestyle coverage. So you’ll want to pay special attention to his recommendations in that department.\n\nI sat him down for this inquisition on Friday.\n\nAdam: OK, you’re hosting a morning newsletter. Are you a morning person?\n\nSam: I am. The hours between 5 and 9 pulse with creativity. And I love to greet a dawn. But I also know there are going to be some late nights on this show. Late nights, early mornings. I quit coffee during the pandemic. Let’s see if that holds!\n\nI’m caffeine-free as well. What’s the go-to breakfast?\n\nBreakfasts are routines. You perform yours until you start performing another one for reasons of whim or happenstance: granola and yogurt; French toast; a single fried egg with toast and marmalade; cut fruit. The past couple of days, I’ve been big into a toasted bagel with a lot of butter and a single slice each of deli ham and Swiss cheese.\n\nLast year, the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale gave you an honorary doctorate and described your last newsletter, What to Cook, as a “secular sermon.” What were you trying to do there and how does it apply to your new role with The Morning?\n\nI just wanted to let readers know: Everything’s going to be all right. Even if it’s awful right now, even if you’ve never made mayonnaise, even if you’re scared. We’ll figure it out. We’ll get to the truth. We’ll make something sustaining no matter what’s happening in the world. Most of all, I think I wanted to leave people with this thought: You’re not alone. And that’s my goal with The Morning, too.\n\nA leitmotif in the cooking newsletter was your life on the water. Tell us about it.\n\nI’ve been messing around in boats since I was a kid at my grandparents’ home in Maine. I’ve worked on schooners and cruise boats in New York Harbor, run light-tackle fishing boats here in the city and on Long Island, sailed up and down the East Coast. There’s something fantastic about being out on the water, especially when the cell service drops away. It’s a kind of freedom. And you can put some amazing stuff in your eyeballs experiencing it.\n\nAnother leitmotif was the casual way you throw together meals. Your cookbook is called “No-Recipe Recipes.” What are your tips for people who want to graduate from paint-by-numbers chefs to improvisational chefs? For me, it was all about reps.\n\nSometimes I love following a recipe — it’s like learning a new piece of music. Other times I just want to jam. But you’re right that getting your reps in makes jamming a great deal easier. It brings you confidence: in your skills, in your taste. Make any recipe three or four times and it’s no longer the author’s. It’s yours.\n\nHow’d you get into journalism?\n\nI wrote for my high school newspaper and something clicked. You can ask questions and write down the answers and deliver them to people and they’re happy to know — or really mad because they didn’t want anyone to know. I thought, If I can do that right, I’ll never have to get a real job.\n\nYou’re avuncular, even jolly. Are you one of these eternal optimists?\n\nI don’t know that my family would agree with that description. So I’ll paraphrase Machiavelli. There is nothing more important than appearing to be an optimist.\n\nYou’re a student of New York Times history. Give us a fun story about the old days.\n\nOne of my first jobs at The Times was editing the travel and food writing of a political reporter named R.W. Apple Jr., whom everyone called Johnny. Johnny was larger than life in his interests and in his appetites. One of the great rumors was that his expenses were so extravagant that they had their own cost center, separate from any department in the newsroom. I certainly never saw them.\n\nCellphones weren’t prevalent then, and Johnny was always on the road, chasing politics, eating immoderate meals. I found myself on deadline with a story of his about a trip to Vancouver (“Conspire to arrive by ship,” he wrote). I needed to get 10 lines out of the piece so it would fit on the page, but he demanded to be consulted about cuts. And he was nowhere to be found. What to do?\n\nI found a politics editor who said Johnny was in Ohio, talking to voters. That wasn’t much to go on. I thought for a minute, then went to a travel guide and made a list of all the four-star hotels in the state.\n\nI found Johnny on the second call. He laughed and laughed. We were only five minutes late.\n\nYour house is a bit of an animal sanctuary.\n\nTwo large dogs. One small cat, who is the bossiest. It can feel like a farm.\n\nOK, lightning round. Favorite book about boats.\n\n“Spartina,” by John Casey, from 1989. What a beautifully written novel. If I could spend a season working for Dick Pierce, the swamp Yankee protagonist of that excellent accounting of a complicated life in South County, Rhode Island, I’d do it. He’d no doubt make me as miserable on the water as on the shore, but I’m so fascinated by his world it’d be worth the pain. Plus, those sentences!\n\nFavorite song about food.\n\nNas, “Fried Chicken”? Kacey Musgraves, “Biscuits”? UB40, “Red Red Wine”? Too many choices!\n\nFavorite movie about New York.\n\nSpike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing.” (Hat tip to “Metropolitan” and the original “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.”)\n\nFavorite neighborhood you’ve lived in.\n\nRed Hook, Brooklyn. I’ve been there close to 20 years.\n\nFavorite dish in Brooklyn.\n\nThere are far too many great dishes here to choose just one. Sometimes I want a banh mi from Ba Xuyen in Sunset Park, or a calzone at Lucali in Carroll Gardens. Other times, dry pot chicken from Authentic Szechuan in Park Slope. Doubles at A&A in Bed-Stuy? She-crab soup at Gage & Tollner in Downtown Brooklyn? I’m into all of it.\n\nFavorite thing to find at the farmers’ market.\n\nPea shoots, in a close tie with fairy-tale eggplants.\n\nFavorite thing to cook.\n\nCurrently? Clay pot rice, in the rice cooker. That’s a fine dinner.\n\nWhat scares you about this new role?\n\nYou mean writing a letter about news to millions and millions of people? Hoping that it’ll be the first thing they read in the morning while lying in bed? Hoping it’ll inform them, delight them, help them understand the world? What would scare me about that? See you in The Morning!\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/world/americas/mexico-day-of-the-dead-bones-pomuch.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:01:37-05:00","title":"To Celebrate Day of the Dead, One Mexican Town Digs Up Its Dead","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the Yucatán Peninsula town of Pomuch, a living tradition of exhuming and cleaning the bones of deceased loved ones is practiced as an act of love and spiritual connection with ancestors, rooted in ancient Maya beliefs about the afterlife.

cleaned the pile of bones that was once her first.\n\nWith a white cloth, Jorge Jurado wiped down a femur, dusted vertebrae and polished each of the scattered teeth of his wife’s deceased husband, one by one.\n\n“It’s with love and affection,” said Mr. Jurado, 66, brushing the dirt from what appeared to be a finger. “When she feels happy, I feel happy, too.”\n\nMs. Euan agreed. Days earlier, they had cleaned the bones of Mr. Jurado’s first wife.\n\n“At our age, we don’t get jealous,” said Ms. Euan, 69. “And with the dead who have gone to rest, even less.”\n\nHere in Pomuch, a town of 10,000 on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, exhumation is an act of love.\n\nGulf of Mexico\n\nThe New York Times\n\nIt is also a ritual of increasing interest to tourists, and to local officials who sense an opportunity — a point of rising tension in Pomuch, one of the final places in Mexico with a living tradition of cleaning the bones of the dead.\n\nEvery year in the weeks leading up to Mexico’s famed Day of the Dead holiday — celebrated this weekend — residents of Pomuch head to the cemetery to unpack boxes of disassembled skeletons and dust off their loved ones’ bones, in a ritual intended to honor and soothe the spirits of their ancestors.\n\n“We haven’t abandoned you, and I don’t plan to,” Mauro Canul, a 41-year-old Navy officer, said to his grandfather’s bones as he dusted them with a paintbrush.\n\nHe said his grandfather had visited him in his dreams asking for more attention. Now Mr. Canul was sitting in front of two piles of bones — his grandfather and grandmother — with tufts of matted hair atop each skull. “I can’t see them,\" he said, “but I can touch them.”\n\nThe ritual has roots in the Maya civilization that dominated the region until Spanish colonizers arrived in the 1500s.\n\nScholars believe that Mayans sometimes exhumed remains and rearranged bones as a way to honor the dead, part of a larger belief that death is a passageway to an afterlife where ancestors look after their descendants. It is that belief that underpins Mexico’s Day of the Dead celebrations, which typically involve altars with offerings to deceased relatives’ souls.\n\nMexico is built on the mixing of Indigenous and Hispanic cultures, and that is true in Pomuch, too. Much of the town’s population has Mayan heritage and is deeply Catholic. Several residents cleaning bones this week cited the Bible as the basis.\n\nLázaro Hilario Tuz Chi, a Pomuch historian and anthropologist, said Pomuch has long had a rich history with the dead. It was once an important stop on a Maya route to a holy burial ground and a producer of burial shrouds. He said that helped breed a culture focused on the afterlife, which has become even stronger over the past two decades as he and other locals have promoted the bone-cleaning tradition.\n\nAs a result, Pomuch has recently landed on the Day of the Dead tourist circuit.\n\nLast week, tour groups of French and Italian tourists spilled out of vans in front of the small tortilla shops across from Pomuch’s cemetery. Couples and families arrived in rental cars. One Dutch couple said they were there on the advice of ChatGPT. Drones sometimes hovered overhead.\n\nThe cemetery is a labyrinth of narrow passageways between multicolored, concrete ossuaries, each full of boxes with skulls peeking out. The tight quarters meant that, as locals laid out the remains of their loved ones, tourists often crowded around. Some asked permission to record with their limited Spanish or via their tour guide, while others simply arrived with their phones already filming.\n\n“I don’t know if I’d be able to do this with my relatives,” said Chiara Ciliberti, 32, an Italian tourist on a group trip to Cancún.\n\nThis year, local officials tried to capitalize on the growing interest.\n\nOn Oct. 21, Pomuch’s local government posted on social media that it was offering a chance for people to observe and “participate” in the bone cleaning for 30 pesos, or about $1.60.\n\nPomuch residents quickly criticized the idea of turning their tradition into a tourist attraction, and many were confused over whether they would have to pay to enter the cemetery.\n\n“The ritual is something totally private. It belongs to the family and their deceased,” said Carlos Ucán, a state lawmaker from Pomuch who criticized the plan on the floor of the legislature. “Many open it up and invite others to see, but even that is already crossing the fine line between sharing and monetizing.”\n\nEventually the local government reversed course. Pomuch’s mayor, Cevas Yam, said in an interview that his team had communicated poorly, but that he still wanted to find a solution that balances economic opportunity with cultural preservation. “There is sustainable tourism,” he said. “But it’s a very, very sensitive issue.”\n\nLocals appear split.\n\n“I want this tradition to be made known,” said Mr. Canul, just before holding up his grandfather’s skull for several French tourists to photograph. “We’re happy you’re here.”\n\nNot all neighbors were as comfortable. A local handyman, José Fernandez, said his business charging 40 pesos, or about $2, to clean a box of bones was thriving. He said that he cleans roughly 200 remains a year, and that many clients hire him to avoid being under the gaze of outsiders themselves.\n\nLocals traditionally exhume their relatives’ corpses three years after interment. Gravediggers then sometimes clean the remnants of decomposing flesh, before family members rub the bones with rum or quicklime and leave them in the sun to dry.\n\nIn subsequent years, the cleaning largely involves lightly brushing the bones, a process that is more about the emotional and spiritual connection with the dead than any actual cleaning, locals said.\n\nOnce dusted, the bones are wrapped in a new white, embroidered cloth and arranged in a box until the next year.\n\nMany residents said they clean the bones of grandparents or parents who taught them the tradition, and last week, several older residents had brought along children or grandchildren with the hope that those younger relatives would one day clean their bones.\n\n“They’ll do it on the day they need to, and their children have to do it, too,” said Dulce Cohuo, 84, watching her daughter polish her husband’s skull. “It’s a chain that can’t be broken.”\n\nMany in Pomuch have been embracing its growing reputation. The town’s main drag to the cemetery is lined with murals of skulls, and on Friday, its Day of the Dead festival attracted thousands.\n\nAt the celebration, a group of local schoolteachers prepared the traditional Day of the Dead meal of the Yucatán: pibipollo, a large tamale stuffed with chicken, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked underground. The process, which has Maya origins, is thought to represent a body in a grave, and it has such a connection to death that some locals skip the ritual if a loved one recently died.\n\nThe schoolteachers said they wanted to educate outsiders to Pomuch about the tradition. They hoped the community could do the same with the cleaning of the bones — while also preserving the practice.\n\n“That intimacy has been taken away. But my perception is that the people don’t see it in a bad light, but rather as a way to spread what Pomuch is about,” said one teacher, Eduardo Puc Medina.\n\nWhat is Pomuch about? “We don’t just honor our dead,” his colleague, Marco Mut, explained. “We live with them every day.”\n\n"}]}
