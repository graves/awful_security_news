     \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roughly 42 million people are at risk of losing critical food assistance in November amid the federal government shutdown. And it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will step in to find the funds to continue paying benefits, as it has with  other priorities .\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program will run out of money in two weeks, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “So you’re talking about millions and millions of vulnerable families, of hungry families that are not going to have access to these programs because of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Like other members of the Trump administration, Rollins cast blame on the Democrats,  posting on X  Thursday that they are putting “their political agenda ahead of food security for American families.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued Republicans are at fault for being unwilling to negotiate a spending deal that includes the extension of  expiring enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Rollins’ comments came a week after the US Department of Agriculture told states that there is not enough money to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues. The agency asked states to hold off on November payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, the program provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of $188 per person, as of May.\n \n\n   \n    Debate over contingency funding\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s largest anti-hunger program, SNAP has a contingency fund of about $6 billion, but November benefits are expected to total around $8 billion. The USDA’s shutdown plan noted multi-year contingency funding is available to fund benefits in the event of a lapse.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the USDA intends to make at least a partial benefit payment next month, a senior agency official pointed to Rollins’ comments that the program’s funding will be depleted in two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the Trump administration for requiring states to halt the process of issuing monthly benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a deliberate and unprecedented decision intended to inflict pain on millions of hardworking American families — the federal government should instead do everything in its power to prioritize our most vulnerable and make funding available for this critical program,” Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program is the second nutrition assistance lifeline at risk of running out of money amid the ongoing standoff on Capitol Hill between Republicans and Democrats over approving a federal spending package for the current fiscal year. The impasse forced the federal government to shut down on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which provides food aid to nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children, was on course to deplete its funding earlier this month. But the Trump administration shifted $300 million in  tariff revenue  that’s typically used to fund child nutrition programs to keep WIC operating. The infusion should be enough to cover benefits for the rest of the month, according to the National WIC Association.\n \n\n   \n  However, there is not enough of that tariff revenue to also shore up the food stamp program for November, a senior USDA official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The looming lack of funding is already forcing 17 states to stop accepting new food stamp applications. That’s because their systems would require them to send partial October payments with November’s benefits. Other states are able to separate payments for the two months and can distribute October’s aid to new enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   \n    Critical program\n \n\n   \n  Food stamps provide critical assistance to families who need the help to be able to eat, said Gina Plata-Nino, acting director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group.\n \n\n   \n  The November benefits are especially important with Thanksgiving on the horizon, she said. And food pantries can’t fill the gap since they are already under strain.\n \n\n   \n  The administration should act urgently to protect food stamp benefits, as it has done with its other priorities during the impasse, said Ty Jones Cox, vice president of food assistance at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t let households who need help purchasing food become another casualty of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/sport/baseball-mlb-mariners-blue-jays-game-5-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:49:00-04:00","title":"Eugenio Suárez grand slam powers Seattle Mariners to within one win of first World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eugenio Suárez hit a grand slam in the bottom of the eighth inning to give the Seattle Mariners a 6-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, moving the team to a 3-2 series lead and within one win of their first World Series appearance in franchise history.

swing of the bat by a  Mariner  in 30 years happened on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n   Eugenio Suárez  approached the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning with the score tied at two each. Moments later, he hit just the second grand slam in franchise postseason history to give Seattle a 6-2 win over the  Toronto Blue Jays  and put the Mariners closer to the World Series than they have ever been.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been waiting for games like this my whole career,” said Suárez in an emotional postgame press conference to which he brought his two daughters.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I had it. Today I had it in front of our crowd, in front of my family – my two daughters, my wife. The moment is very special right now.”\n \n\n   \n  After defeating the New York Yankees in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) – a win which many believed  saved baseball in Seattle  – the Mariners came within two wins of the World Series in the resulting Championship Series but ultimately lost out to Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Five years later they were within two victories of the promised land once again, but could not get past the Yankees.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Seattle needs just one more win to erase its unwanted record of being the only active major league franchise never to make it to the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  “After Geno’s grand slam, I’m not sure I’ve heard that building any louder than that,” said Mariners manager Dan Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you emotional thinking about that, and just how loud it was in that moment. Talking to a lot of people who have been around here since the 2001 days, and they don’t remember a time that it was this loud before.”\n \n\n   \n  After the Blue Jays had tied the series with two alarmingly comfortable wins in Seattle in Games 3 and 4, Suárez got the Mariners on the board with a solo home run to left field in the second inning.\n \n\n   \n  A magnificent double play from Cal Raleigh got Seattle out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, but the Blue Jays struck back after Mariners starter Bryce Miller was surprisingly sat down in the fifth inning.\n \n\n   \n  A two-out double from George Springer brought home Addison Barger in the fifth to tie the game, before Ernie Clement’s single drove in Alejando Kirk an inning later.\n \n\n   \n  By the eighth inning, the Mariners were facing the serious possibility of having to win both games in Toronto to take the series. But they found a spark from a familiar source, Raleigh tying the game with a floaty fly ball which hung in the air for 6.7 seconds before just barely clearing the wall in left field.\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like Cal’s ball was in the air for about an hour,” smiled Wilson after the game.\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh’s homer – his fourth this postseason and his 64th including the regular season – means he is now tied with Aaron Judge in 2022 for the most in a single year in the American League.\n \n\n   \n  It was also Seattle’s first game-tying or go-ahead home run in the eighth inning or later of a playoff game since Bret Boone in Game 4 of the 2001 American League Championship Series (ALCS).\n \n\n   \n  Having waited 24 years for such a dramatic postseason homer, Seattle fans were treated to another just moments later when Suárez’s heroics gave the Mariners an insurmountable lead.\n \n\n   \n  They now lead the series 3-2 and go back on the road.

Circular sanders smooth rough edges on costly Sitka spruce soundboards. Hammers and chisels notch a bridge to allow piano strings to vibrate freely.\n \n\n   \n  For 30 years, Bernard Craddock has been one of the roughly 200 workers handcrafting pianos at the 150-year-old Steinway & Sons factory in Astoria, a neighborhood in the New York borough of ﻿Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody has a specific job here,” Craddock said, working on a piano frame. “My job is to set this straight for the hammers to hit the strings.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has vowed to start an American manufacturing renaissance, one of the main aims of his trade war. But manufacturing isn’t easy anywhere in the United States thanks to high costs, strict regulations and lack of workers with the necessary skills.\n \n\n   \n  Steinway & Sons, however, is a rare bright spot in US manufacturing. A company that thrives because it doesn’t mass produce its product. Instead, it uses a small workforce of skilled craftsmen to produce a premium item — world-class pianos.\n \n\n   \n  “They have this storied, legacy brand,” said Adam Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “They can charge a premium for that, but they also are serving higher market segments that can afford to pay those premium prices and need to because they’re performing on pianos at the highest levels.”\n \n\n   \n  Most US manufacturers are forced to compete on price, which has become tougher as Trump’s tariffs, especially on key inputs like steel, aluminum and copper, have raised prices.\n \n\n   \n  But by making pianos many consider the best in the world, Steinway can charge high enough prices to keep its US-based operation up and running. A Steinway grand piano can be priced as low as $90,000 or as much as $200,000.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we are the largest manufacturer remaining in New York City, we’re very proud of that. It’s not easy to continue to manufacture in New York,” Steinway & Sons CEO Ben Steiner told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steiner said his company thrives because it focuses on quality merchandise.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no other way with the cost structure that we have to operate in New York City, or even operating in the United States or in Europe,” he added. “Unless you’re focused on quality and innovation, you’re not going to survive.”\n \n\n   \n     Trump’s chaotic trade agenda hurts jobs \n \n\n   \n  Despite the stated goal of reshoring manufacturing jobs, Trump’s tariffs on most US imports may be  having the opposite effect .\n \n\n   \n  The US shed another  12,000 manufacutring jobs in August , the latest data available, for the fourth month in a row. Roughly 42,000 jobs have been lost since April.\n \n\n   \n  Hersh said Trump’s chaotic trade agenda is acting as a roadblock to factory hiring.\n \n\n   \n  “Businesses don’t like (tariffs), but they can adjust to a reasonable tariff,” Hersh said. “(Trump has) created uncertainty for the economy that just has businesses sitting on their hands, not being able to make decisions about investment or to hire new workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House told CNN that the goal of Trump’s policy is to ensure domestic manufacturers are able to source everything the need in the US, from inputs to workers.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot just be an assembler of foreign-made parts. The Trump administration is taking a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshore every step of the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “There is no shortage of American hands and minds to build America’s next industrial Golden Age.”\n \n\n   \n  But American manufacturing looks very different from five decades ago, when millions of workers were employed to perform specific tasks along assembly lines. After trade agreements flourished in the 1990s, many of those jobs moved abroad.\n \n\n   \n  And in today’s age of automation and artificial intelligence, factory floors are increasingly filled with robots. That means US factories require fewer workers with specialized skills.\n \n\n   \n  Like at Steinway, where making pianos suitable for the world’s best concert halls isn’t a quick process. Building a piano takes Steinway’s skilled craftsmen 11 months from start to finish. On average, workers complete only four or five pianos a day.\n \n\n   \n  And because the piano’s many components are domestically sourced, Steiner said tariffs haven’t impacted them significantly.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s minor impacts in certain materials, but because we manufacture in the United States, it’s not a major issue for us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Maintaining a consistent workforce\n \n\n   \n  While top-of-the-line pricing and domestic sourcing can solve a lot of problems for Steinway, it can’t solve them all.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest challenges facing the piano maker is a potential shortage of Sitka spruce lumber, which Steiner said makes the very best instruments.\n \n\n   \n  “For the Sitka spruce, we find that the best in the world comes from a particular part of Alaska where there’s a very short growing season,” he said. “As a consequence, the trees grow very slowly.”\n \n\n   \n  And Steinway needs to make sure one other component is in good supply: skilled workers.\n \n\n   \n  The factory in Astoria has been in almost continuous operation since 1873, with only temporary pauses in piano production during the Great Depression and World War II. During that time, the company produced glider parts for the war effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It not only kept the lights on, so to speak, but it kept some of the valued craftspeople around,” said Anthony Gilroy, Steinway’s Vice President for Marketing and Communications. “The Steinways were smart enough to know that after the war you’d get a lot of people coming back willing to work but without the skills to build pianos, and you needed these old timers, if you will, here in the factory to train the next generation of piano makers.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of the reason Steinway & Sons has never considered relocating out of New York City. It’s those highly specific jobs – performed by “old timers” like 30-year craftsman Craddock in the frame assembly department – why Steinway keeps calling Astoria home.\n \n\n   \n  “The skills that they have, you can’t replicate it. You can’t just open up a factory somewhere else and have those skills,” said Steiner. “So long as our craftspeople are here I can’t think of any reason why they wouldn’t be, then we’ll still be making our pianos here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/uk/prince-andrew-gives-up-royal-titles-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:51:00-04:00","title":"Prince Andrew Gives Up Royal Titles After String of Scandals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has officially given up his royal titles, including Duke of York, after years of public scrutiny linked to his relationships with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo.

EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A series of public statements from the Department of Homeland Security during its  migrant crackdown in Chicago  and across the country has been contradicted or undermined by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing.\n \n\n   \n  These issues have been particularly notable in three prominent incidents: the arrest of a WGN employee, the shooting of a US citizen accused of ramming police vehicles and ICE’s detention of a 13-year-old in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  A closer look at the incidents underscores the broader skepticism of the Department of Homeland Security’s statements as federal agents have moved into city streets in Chicago and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a  federal judge temporarily halted  the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, saying its statements about protests were “not reliable.” The administration had highlighted several arrests for carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents – but the judge responded that federal grand juries had refused to indict at least three of those arrested, indicating a lack of probable cause.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” US District Court Judge April Perry wrote in her order of those incidents.\n \n\n   \n  A judge openly questioning the credibility of law enforcement reflects a larger problem and raises questions as to what recourse ordinary citizens or immigrants have when accused.\n \n\n   \n  “A lawyer’s credibility isn’t just about personal integrity; it’s a factor judges are required to consider when ruling,” said Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “Simply put, parties lose when courts find their lawyers untrustworthy. DHS’s problem is how alarmingly consistent judges have been with their questions about the department’s work and its attorneys’ trustworthiness.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has appealed the ruling. DHS has said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst,” and its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  To understand this credibility issue, CNN took a closer look at DHS statements about the three high-profile incidents involving federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the contradictions between the DHS statements and other evidence, a spokesperson said, “We stand by everything we have previously said.”\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of WGN employee\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander last week captured the arrest of an employee working for the  Chicago TV station WGN .\n \n\n   \n  In the video, officers put the employee, Debbie Brockman, in handcuffs while she lies prone on the ground, her pants falling down. The officers then put her in an unmarked vehicle and leave the scene.\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the agents like, well, why are you detaining this person?” Josh Thomas, the witness who took the video of the arrest, told CNN. “They basically tell me she’s obstructing justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said he did not witness Brockman’s interaction with the agents before she was detained.\n \n\n   \n  Brockman was released without charges – either for obstructing justice or assault – after about seven hours of detention, according to her attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  After the video spread on social media, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia  McLaughlin said in a post on X  that the arrest came as US Border Patrol was driving around conducting immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, her attorneys disputed McLaughlin’s version of events and said she was attacked by federal agents while on her morning commute.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work,” the attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n    Car ramming suspect and firearm\n \n\n   \n  DHS’s statements about the shooting of a 30-year-old US citizen have been undermined by a criminal complaint and by an attorney who watched body-camera footage of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Marimar Martinez, the US citizen, was arrested and shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago on October 4.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a  post on X  that multiple drivers, one of whom was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” rammed a law enforcement vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  A  DHS press release  repeated the allegation that Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” Together, the statements gave the impression Martinez had been brandishing her firearm when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez was charged in federal court with forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. The criminal complaint, though, does not mention a semi-automatic weapon or that Martinez was armed.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the complaint alleges Martinez drove into and side-swiped a CBP vehicle. When an agent got out of the vehicle, Martinez drove at the agent, who fired about five shots at Martinez, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  In court Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Richard Bond said Martinez “forcibly impeded Border Patrol agents,” and that the case involved a dangerous weapon – a motor vehicle. Martinez pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN she has a concealed-carry license and had a handgun in her purse, inside a holster with the snap closed. “(It was) never brought out in this incident,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente has disputed the government’s account generally as well. He said he viewed body-camera footage, which has not been made public, that he said shows a CBP vehicle swerved into Martinez’s vehicle — not the other way around. Then, “within seconds,” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  “Normally in a criminal case I would not speak to the media until the case is over, but there is such misinformation out there that the public needs to see this is not what they’ve been sold by the government,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I think anybody who sees what’s going on today is going to question these indictments coming out of the Department of Justice,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of Massachusetts teen\n \n\n   \n  A 13-year-old in Everett, Massachusetts, was  detained by ICE  and moved to a different state last week in a case in which local officials have contradicted a key statement from a DHS official.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest took place October 9 when police called Josiele Berto, the mother of 13-year-old Arthur, to say her son had been arrested. The teenager was then detained by ICE and moved to Virginia, she soon learned.\n \n\n   \n  The Berto family is from Brazil and have had a pending asylum application since arriving in the US in 2021, Berto said.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS official,  posted on X  what she said were the “facts” of the case, saying the teenager “was in possession of a firearm and 5-7 inch knife when arrested.”\n \n\n   \n  Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said a teenage boy – who he did not name because he is a juvenile – was arrested after Everett Police received a “credible tip” accusing him of making “a violent threat against another boy within our public school.”\n \n\n   \n  He confirmed the presence of the knife but was adamant that the teen did not have a firearm. “No guns were found,” DeMaria said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the discrepancy between the statements by McLaughlin and DeMaria over whether the child had a gun.\n \n\n   \n    Judge calls for use of body cameras\n\n \n\n   \n  Credibility questions have long trailed law enforcement agencies, whether federal or local, and police statements immediately after an arrest have occasionally proved to be incorrect or misleading. The murder of George Floyd, for example, was  initially described by Minneapolis Police  as, “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former DHS executive, said misleading claims can be exposed in the modern age.\n \n\n   \n  “In an era where everyone has a camera in their pocket, social media has been flooded with videos of immigration operations,” she said. “DHS must seriously understand that any blatantly misleading claim about tactics can often be easily disproved in this new digital age, especially if they’re happening frequently.”\n \n\n   \n  The credibility questions have also placed a spotlight on one law enforcement tool often missing from immigration enforcement operations: body-worn cameras. The technology is a staple at police departments across the country, documenting encounters with the public and helping clarify questionable incidents and competing claims.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago questioned whether federal law enforcement agents are following an earlier order and said she will  require all agents with body cameras  to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/donald-trump-new-jersey-virginia-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-04:00","title":"Donald Trump is not on the ballot, but he’s a major factor in the November elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite not being on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a major political force in the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.

elections \n       \n  By Jeff Zeleny, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump may not be on the ballot in the fall’s biggest political races, but both sides are counting on him to help them win.\n \n\n   \n  A year after winning back the White House, Republicans are racing to motivate voters who love the president and Democrats are rallying those who don’t, as the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia play out as an early referendum on Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  “If you get a flat tire on the way home today, she’s going to blame President Trump,” said Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee in New Jersey, drawing laughs as he takes aim at his Democratic rival, Rep. Mikie Sherrill. “There’s nothing she won’t blame on the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing a fierce fight, Sherrill is quick to invoke Trump in a different way, telling supporters: “That tariff plan? It’s a world-wide extortion scheme so that the Trump family can make billions of dollars. That is not creating opportunity for anyone in New Jersey.”\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states in the country that hold gubernatorial elections the year after a presidential campaign. The races could provide an early glimpse at the mood of the electorate, particularly toward the president’s party, but also as a test of enthusiasm as Democrats scramble to rebuild.\n \n\n   \n  The White House is keeping a close eye on both contests, yet Trump has only made a formal endorsement in New Jersey. He is poised to record messages on behalf of Ciattarelli and hold telephone rallies for his campaign, both of which are intended to specifically remind Trump voters about the urgency of the Nov. 4 contest.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re deploying his help in very strategic ways,” said Ciattarelli, who is seeking to walk a careful line of tapping into forces of the MAGA movement, while trying to dampen criticism of being too aligned with Trump. “This race is about New Jersey. It’s not about the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the government shutdown hangs over the race, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers, active-duty military and government contractors living in the state. The contest between former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, is seen as less competitive, which is among the reasons that aides to Trump say he has kept more of a distance.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey gains\n \n\n   \n  It’s far from certain how successful attempts to insert Trump into the race will be – or whether they could backfire on Democrats. He made significant gains in both states last fall, but his improvement was particularly notable in New Jersey, where Trump lost by 6 points after a punishing 16-point defeat in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Spanberger, who were among the Democrats elected to Congress in 2018 during the first midterm election of Trump’s presidency, are relying less on arguments of protecting democracy and more on the tangible impacts of Trump’s policies in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  When the president said from the Oval Office this week that he “terminated” the Gateway tunnel, a $16 billion commuter rail between New Jersey and New York, as retribution to Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, Sherrill seized on the moment. She said New Jersey would lose tens of thousands of jobs and residents would suffer because of Trump’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “We see an out of control president, just at his whim, saying he’s going to cancel it,” Sherrill told reporters Thursday. “We are going to stand up and fight for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than three weeks before the election, the president’s words injected a fresh headache into the race for Ciattarelli and set the table for a real-world test of his embrace of Trump. He said he supported the “a critical infrastructure project,” adding New Jersey needed a new governor who had a good relationship “and when necessary, disagree” with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump effect is on full display in dueling campaign ads, where Sherill repeatedly calls her rival “Jack Ciattarelli, the Trump of Trenton.” Ciattarelli fires back, saying: “New Jersey’s a mess and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s also playing out on the debate stage when candidates were asked to grade Trump’s performance. Ciattarelli gave him an “A,” saying: “I think he’s right about everything he’s doing.” Sherrill blasted her opponent and his support of Trump, declaring: “I’d give him an F.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Banking on that voters’ remorse’\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, it’s yet another test of how many Trump voters will cast ballots in elections in which his name is not on the ballot. The outcome could provide important lessons for both parties heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with control of Congress on the line.\n \n\n   \n  With early voting well underway in New Jersey and Virginia, conversations with voters suggest an exhaustion factor with Trump. Yet, for many, it’s unclear whether the president will be a deciding factor in a race driven by economic concerns like affordability and a call for change.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill is seeking to replace New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, who has been in office for eight years. Not since 1961 have Democrats won three consecutive elections as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not Trump’s race, it’s Jack’s race,” said Kathy Mueller Rohan, a voter from Morris County, New Jersey, which Trump narrowly carried last fall after losing it by about 4 points in 2020. “I don’t think he needs Trump to win.”\n \n\n   \n  But she believes the president could be helpful, particularly in places where he gained ground. New Jersey is among the states that saw some of the biggest swings toward Republicans in his third presidential election, particularly in non-white communities, which is one of the reasons Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the Sherrill-Ciattarelli race.\n \n\n   \n  “Quite frankly we’re concerned Donald Trump won Passaic County in last year’s election, so we have our work cut out for us,” said Mayor Andre Sayegh of Paterson, who supports Sherrill. “We’re being very aggressive in attempting to organize and motivate voters turned off by Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The shift towards Trump in Passaic County, home to a large Hispanic community, is one of many painful snapshots of the last election that has not been forgotten by Democrats. It’s a county that Joe Biden won by more than 16 points in 2020 and Trump won by nearly 3 points in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Sayegh, whose office walls are decorated with pictures of John F. Kennedy, said cultural issues have driven many voters in his area away from the Democratic Party. He believes this election is an opportunity for Democrats to rebuild and, perhaps, rebrand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a year ago – now he’s in!” Sayegh said, reflecting on the first year of Trump’s second term. “People, quite frankly, may have voters’ remorse. We’re banking on that voters’ remorse.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/kim-jong-un-donald-trump-asia-trip","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump officials quietly discussing Kim Jong Un meeting during upcoming Asia trip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Trump administration officials are quietly discussing a potential meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Trump’s upcoming Asia trip, driven by Trump’s personal interest sparked by a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung.

upcoming Asia trip \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials have privately discussed setting up a meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when Trump visits Asia next month, though many are skeptical that it will ultimately happen, sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have not yet done any of the serious logistical planning they would need to do to arrange such a visit, the sources said, pointing to the fact that there have not been any communications between Washington and Pyongyang like Trump had at times during his first term. Trump’s initial outreach to the North Korean leader earlier this year never received a reply because the North Koreans would not accept the letter, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For the upcoming trip, the White House has instead been far more  focused on arranging a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping  amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump has publicly and privately expressed a desire to meet his North Korean counterpart, and officials have left the door open to a meeting while he’s on his trip to Asia. In Trump’s first term, officials arranged a  handshake between the two men in the Korean demilitarized zone  in less than 48 hours after the president  tweeted an invitation  to get together — an example of how quickly things can change.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s personal interest in a potential sit-down with Kim was  initially piqued after Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung  at the White House in August, the sources said. During their meeting, Lee formally invited Trump to attend the gathering of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers in South Korea and suggested the setting could provide Trump with a prime opportunity to meet with Kim, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was open to the idea, telling Lee he would look into it.\n \n\n   \n  “I will do that, and we’ll have talks. He’d like to meet with me,” Trump said of the North Korean leader. “We look forward to meeting with him, and we’ll make relations better.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Kim also expressed an openness to sitting down with Trump during a speech before the North Korean parliament last month, according to comments carried by North Korean state media.\n \n\n   \n  “Personally, I still have good memories of US President Trump,” Kim said during his speech, per the reports. “If the US drops its hollow obsession with denuclearization and wants to pursue peaceful coexistence with North Korea based on the recognition of reality, there is no reason for us not to sit down with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  But things have shifted since Trump met Kim in 2019 at Panmunjom on the border that divides the two Koreas. South Korea played a major part in bringing North Korea back to the table and laying the groundwork for that meeting, in which Trump become the first US president step foot in the isolated and reclusive North.\n \n\n   \n  Ties between the two Koreas were much warmer then. South Korea’s new president has only been in power a few months and has yet to undo the legacy of his predecessor, who was far more hawkish towards Kim’s regime.\n \n\n   \n  According to South Korea’s Unification Ministry, there is no ongoing communication between South and North Korea regarding a possible North Korea-US summit.\n \n\n   \n  And while White House security teams have made two trips to South Korea to scout out locations ahead of Trump’s arrival, none of those trips was to the Panmunjom area, a South Korean government source said, suggesting a repeat of  the 2019 summit with Kim  is not in the cards for now.\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n    A hastily arranged handshake\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile summits between Trump and Kim during the president’s first term failed to accomplish the president’s main goal: reining in North Korea’s nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Their meetings in Hanoi and Singapore came after intense prep work between the two sides that focused heavily on logistics and substance. As a result, administration officials and experts believe that if they were to meet again, both sides would have to be making arrangements now.\n \n\n   \n  But not every engagement between the two leaders was built upon the prolonged planning of working-level officials. The last meeting between Trump and Kim in 2019 was arranged hastily after the president tweeted an invitation to get together.\n \n\n   \n  The post abruptly set the wheels into motion for the two to meet at the DMZ – a now famous visit that resulted in Trump briefly stepping over the demarcation line into North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of that invitation, there had not been any active communications between the two sides for months, CNN previously reported. Rather, Trump had departed his last summit with the North Korean leader in Hanoi earlier that year without a deal or any signs of progress, signaling the breakdown of diplomatic efforts at the highest level.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to walk,”  Trump said during  a news conference following the conclusion of the Hanoi summit, which broke up earlier than planned. “This was just one of those times.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s 2019 South Korea trip, his former North Korea staffers had considered trying to organize another meeting between the two leaders, but ultimately decided against it because they did not think that the moment was ripe to draw North Korea back to the table, according to former administration officials.\n \n\n   \n  That changed, however, when Trump began expressing interest in a sit down while he was on the ground in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  The president mentioned a possible meeting when he met with Chinese leader Xi at the time. He asked his then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if he thought it would be a good idea, according to a former administration official. Pompeo said he would look into it. To the surprise of many of the members of the team working on the North Korea portfolio, Trump’s tweet went out the next morning.\n \n\n   \n  “After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!” Trump tweeted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials immediately went into overdrive as they tried to figure out if Kim would accept. A Korean Central News Agency article came out hours after Trump’s tweet signaling Pyongyang’s openness to the meeting – something the Trump administration closely noted, the former official said. While the article stated that the North Koreans did not know the purpose of the meeting, they did not close the door on the possibility. Administration officials at that point believed a meeting was highly likely, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration then activated the US-North Korea hotline located at the DMZ that is manned 24/7 by a US military officer who speaks Korean. But the calls went unanswered. Then they turned to another tactic that they had used before: a bullhorn. A US military officer went to the border and used the bullhorn to project the message to the North Korean side that the US was trying to communicate with them about a leader-level meeting, the former official said. On the other side, a North Korean recorded the message but did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the hotline rang with an invitation for a US delegation to come to North Korea for a planning meeting. The US delegation, which included the Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun, State Department official Kevin Kim and the NSA Senior Director for the Korean Peninsula Allison Hooker, flew from Seoul to the DMZ the same night that Trump’s tweet had been sent, where they met for about an hour with their North Korean counterparts. The two sides discussed the possible meeting but nothing was formally agreed to, and the Trump administration officials left with North Korea’s request for a detailed proposal by midnight. That proposal was faxed to Pyongyang when the officials returned to Seoul.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s response did not come overnight, and in the morning, US officials were monitoring every possible channel closely. Then a clear signal came through: the North Koreans had sent an expansive team to clean their side of the space along the Military Demarcation Line that divides North and South Korea, which was highly unusual. Then the hotline rang, and the news came that Kim Jong Un would partake in the meeting with Trump later that day.\n \n\n   \n  As he approached the North Korean leader, Trump took 20 steps into the country, making history as the first sitting US leader to set foot in the hermit kingdom. The two leaders then shook hands and met for about an hour.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/africa/gen-z-topples-madagascars-president-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Gen Z protesters toppled Madagascar’s president.

Should other African leaders worry? \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:46 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This week, the military in Madagascar grabbed power as youth-led protests escalated, forcing President Andry Rajoelina to flee.\n \n\n   \n  The scenario was a familiar one for Rajoelina, 51, a former DJ, who was initially brought to power by the military in 2009 after another youth-driven uprising sent his predecessor into exile.\n \n\n   \n  Events in Madagascar reflect a broader trend of similar protests in recent years, impacting countries across Africa, Asia and South America.\n \n\n   \n  Although the protests differ in their specific causes, they share a common characteristic: they are primarily led by Generation Z (people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s), who are voicing their dissatisfaction with their governments.\n \n\n   \n  Technology is also a common feature of the protests, which are organized and mobilized through social media.\n \n\n   \n  In  Nepal , a Gen Z movement fuelled by outrage over a social media ban, government corruption and limited economic opportunities led to the ousting of the prime minister in September.\n \n\n   \n  This followed a similar change in  Bangladesh  in 2024. The Bangladeshi ‘ Gen Z revolution’  involved weeks of intense protests, predominantly led by students, and resulted in the ousting of the nation’s long-serving leader Sheikh Hasina.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, in 2022, youth protesters in  Sri Lanka  also succeeded in toppling the ruling regime.\n \n\n   \n  For Madagascar’s Gen Z, removing their president was a priority. However, while Bangladeshis saw a Nobel Peace Prize winner replace Hasina, Madagascar’s president was replaced by the military – meaning the country’s youth may have to wait for their choice of leader.\n \n\n   \n  Madagascar is now  under the control of Michael Randrianirina , the commander of a powerful army unit that previously supported Rajoelina’s rise to power.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the movement, Elliot Randriamandrato, told news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) that “the past few weeks are a half-victory, the real struggle begins now.”\n \n\n   \n  But he believes Rajoelina’s removal was expedited by the military’s involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “People need to understand that one couldn’t have happened without the other,” Randriamandrato told AFP. “Just the military, it wouldn’t have been possible. Just us, it would’ve taken months, even though we were ready for that. The turning point came from the convergence of both.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘African leaders should be wary’\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether what happened in Madagascar will be repeated elsewhere on the continent.\n \n\n   \n  Young people in Africa have been increasingly vocal, calling for major reforms amid growing unrest. The continent has the  world’s youngest population .\n \n\n   \n  In North Africa, young Moroccans have coalesced under the banner of the  “GenZ 212” movement , named after the nation’s international dialling code.\n \n\n   \n  They are critical of the Moroccan government’s priorities, faulting authorities for investments in sports infrastructure which they say overshadow healthcare and education. Recent demonstrations have led to deadly confrontations and  reports of police violence .\n \n\n   \n  In East Africa, Kenya  witnessed protests  stemming from a contentious finance bill that raised taxes during a cost-of-living crisis. These grievances have morphed into calls for regime change, with numerous fatalities reported.\n \n\n   \n  Kingsley Moghalu, a former presidential candidate from Nigeria and a public policy expert, told CNN that these movements signify a growing consciousness among young people of their political power.\n \n\n   \n  Moghalu warns that “underperforming African leaders should be very wary.”\n \n\n   \n  Rajoelina’s removal might rejuvenate protest movements that have lost momentum across the continent, according to Swikani Ncube, a lecturer at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Mass protests in Kenya have not occurred since July. Similarly, a youth uprising in  Mozambique , following a disputed election last year, has been suppressed.\n \n\n   \n  “Where these (protests) had died down, the perceived successes of the youth in Madagascar may serve as a reference point for those who were either losing steam or simply second-guessing their intentions to embark on sustained protests,” Ncube told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Resistance from African Leaders\n \n\n   \n  As youth protests grow stronger, African governments, particularly those that are military-led, are unlikely to surrender their positions without a fight. Even civilian-led administrations have proven survival skills.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, President William Ruto, facing increasing pressure to resign, dared his critics to oust him from office before the next elections in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to tell those characters giving us lectures that they can change this administration using violence and unlawful means before 2027, let them try,” he  said in July , in response to violent demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  In neighboring Uganda, protests inspired by demonstrations in Kenya took place last year, organized by young people denouncing government corruption. During these protests, dozens of activists were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  President Yoweri Museveni, 81, has ruled Uganda with an iron fist for nearly four decades. He warned earlier that demonstrators were  “playing with fire.” \n \n\n   \n  Museveni plans to run for a seventh term in office next year, but he faces a potential challenge from  Bobi Wine , the country’s main opposition leader who is 43 years old. Wine has experienced multiple arrests by Ugandan security forces over the years.\n \n\n   \n  In Madagascar, Rajoelina has shown no signs of relinquishing power following his removal. Although he’s in exile, he hasn’t formally resigned and calls his ousting a coup.\n \n\n   \n    What’s wrong with governance in Africa?\n \n\n   \n  Africa is no stranger to coups or swift changes in government. Security remains a major challenge, with the Sahel – a region stretching from Senegal to Sudan – accounting for more than half  the terror-related deaths worldwide .\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, populations have been frustrated by their leaders’ inability to tackle corruption or deliver much-needed jobs and services.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure of governance in Africa is the most important challenge facing the continent, and it’s very deep-rooted,” said Moghalu.\n \n\n   \n  What makes the Gen Z movement so dangerous to African leaders is that the continent is home to some of the world’s poorest countries, and unemployment is rampant, particularly among young people who make up over half of the population.\n \n\n   \n  Although the demands of young people vary across the continent, Moghalu highlighted a common thread: “Their decision to vent their frustration (on issues plaguing the continent) and take action, rather than bottle it up.”\n \n\n   \n  If these challenges persist, youth-led uprisings are likely to become a regular occurrence in Africa, he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “The Gen Z are an impatient and assertive generation. And the rise of technology makes it easier for them to mobilize.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/travel/travel-news-nazi-underground-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00Z","title":"Deep underground, the Nazis built a city for thousands of soldiers.

In the 1980s and ‘90s, a subculture known as the Bunker People took over the tunnels, hosting unauthorized and often dangerous events here, from raves to weddings.

\nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Another spat between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies has quickly escalated, and if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping don’t lower the temperature soon, both nations stand to pay an exorbitant price.\n \n\n   \n  Sky-high tariffs had brought trade between the two countries to a screeching halt earlier this year, before they reached a monthslong truce and substantially lowered levies on one another.\n \n\n   \n  But trade tensions have reignited, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs  starting at 130%  on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the 30% minimum rate currently in effect. Trump also said he’s prepared to impose export controls on what he referred to as “any and all critical software” to China. Beijing has signaled it would retaliate to all these actions.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump sounded confident he and Xi could resolve matters amicably, telling reporters that he intends to still meet with the Chinese leader on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month. And US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who helps lead trade negotiations with China, said Friday that “things have deescalated” recently.\n \n\n   \n  But that was Friday. At any second, the tide could turn.\n \n\n   \n  So, how did we get here?\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s qualms with China\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  Beijing announced  plans to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals, critical materials needed to power a wide range of electronics. Under the new rules set to take effect later this year, five rare-earth elements were added to China’s existing list of seven other highly restricted rare-earth exports.\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, China’s plan calls for mandated licenses for technology needed to mine, smelt and process rare earths, and to make magnets. Foreign governments and businesses would also need licenses to exchange Chinese-sourced rare earths or technology containing them.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Ministry of Commerce said the restrictions aim to prevent materials from “being used, directly or indirectly, in military and other sensitive fields.”\n \n\n   \n  A day after Beijing announced those measures, Trump took to Truth Social, saying, “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one.”\n \n\n   \n  He went on to say that China has “quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position” with rare earths and called the new restrictions “a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.”\n \n\n   \n  US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has worked on trade agreements with China alongside Bessent, said last week: “It’s a clear repudiation of everything we’ve been working towards for the last six months, which was a stable tariff situation and a continued flow of rare earths.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s provoked China\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s actions came after a series of moves Washington took that drew the ire of Chinese counterparts.\n \n\n   \n  Among them were  ramped-up restrictions  on worldwide exports to Chinese tech giants, including Huawei, of any parts of products manufactured using American equipment or software.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce called the move announced last month “extremely malicious,” adding that the country would “take necessary measures” to protect the rights and interests of its companies.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration earlier this month also started taxing Chinese ships docked at American ports as well as products transported on Chinese-made ships. Beijing responded with a tit-for-tat fee at its ports.\n \n\n   \n  Washington, meanwhile, up until recently, kept extremely tight restrictions on exports of highly advanced chips, aiming to prevent Beijing from making more advancements in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC could be an opportunity to hash out their differences face to face as opposed to through American and Chinese officials. But things could just as easily devolve, pushing the two nations even further apart.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"The ‘6-7’ meme can be annoying.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/gop-rhetoric-no-kings-protests-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The GOP’s extraordinary rhetoric about the 'No Kings' rallies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the lead-up to the 'No Kings' rallies on October 18, 2025, Republican figures including President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep.

And it’s despite  hard data  showing that, even as left-wing violence has increased this year, it still  pales to decades of right-wing violence .\n \n\n   \n  But ahead of the “No Kings” rallies across the country on Saturday, the GOP’s effort has taken a rather stunning turn.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump team and its allies suggested that the rallies, which are likely to draw millions of people, will essentially be chock full of antifa, terrorist sympathizers and even terrorists themselves.\n \n\n   \n  It’s baseless and ugly, yes. But it’s also highly suspect strategically.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP rhetoric surrounding this and the Democratic base more broadly has grown remarkably pitched.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has called them “hate America” rallies and said it’s “all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  A member of his leadership team, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, described the rallies as being held by the “terrorist wing” of the party.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas predicted that “paid protesters” and “agitators” would require calling in the National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the “No Kings” protests were “part of antifa.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicted they would feature the “most unhinged in the Democratic Party.”\n \n\n   \n  Others have stepped up their rhetoric about the left in other contexts.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested the fact that protesters might be provided matching signs could  somehow be evidence of antifa funding . (Trump’s own rallies often include people holding matching signs that were handed out, as  comedian Jimmy Kimmel noted .)\n \n\n   \n  And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued perhaps the most extreme comments Thursday on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrat Party’s main constituency are made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that the kinds of broad brushes being employed here are exactly the kinds of broad brushes Republicans have previously decried.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve spent years assailing Hillary Clinton for putting large numbers of Trump supporters in what she called a “basket of deplorables.” Even less than a year ago, they were seemingly apoplectic about President Joe Biden  arguably calling some Trump supporters “garbage.” \n \n\n   \n  Leavitt herself cast the latter episode as proof that Biden and Kamala Harris “despise the tens of millions of Americans who support” Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The comments also come even as Republicans after Charlie Kirk’s assassination sought to link the coarsening of our rhetoric – things like calling Trump a “fascist” – to political violence.\n \n\n   \n  Does that not also apply to calling wide swaths of the electorate terrorist sympathizers? The administration has now moved from decrying those broad brushes to embracing them.\n \n\n   \n  But even beyond that, it’s a weird strategy.\n \n\n   \n  These aren’t the first “No Kings” rallies, after all. They were also held across the country back in June, and they were overwhelmingly peaceful. The  scenes  were largely full of very normal-looking, liberal Americans speaking their minds.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News this week managed to find  five incidents of violence and/or arrests  from the June rallies – rallies which, again, drew millions.\n \n\n   \n  But two of them were actually  alleged attacks   against  the protesters , with people allegedly targeting them with motor vehicles. In another case in Florida,  2 of 3 people arrested were counter-protesters . A fourth example was a  deadly shooting by a “peacekeeper”  who apparently feared someone was about to carry out a mass shooting. (As of last month, it  wasn’t clear  that either the peacekeeper or the other man would even face charges.)\n \n\n   \n  Anything can happen on Saturday, but the scenes could also provide a rather rapid counterpoint to the alternate reality the GOP is attempting to paint.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic politicians like  California Gov. Gavin Newsom  and  many   others  this week have made a point to emphasize these comments reinforce the need to keep the proceedings peaceful. Some have warned those assembled not to give the administration any scenes that might give it pretexts for Trump’s militarization of the homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona said Trump is “trying to incite violence as a justification just for more control.”\n \n\n   \n  If anything, the scenes in Portland, Oregon, in recent weeks suggest such messages are being received.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters there have taken to  wearing costumes and otherwise engaging in light-hearted forms of protest . Their efforts appear aimed at betraying the ridiculousness of Trump’s decision to send in the National Guard. A Trump-appointed judge has said the administration’s claims of violence in Portland – which Trump has labeled “war ravaged” – are “ untethered to the facts .”\n \n\n   \n  To this point, Trump’s argument that the left is unusually violent doesn’t appear to have penetrated American public opinion.\n \n\n   \n  A  Marquette University Law School poll  last month showed Americans are about evenly split on whether left-wing violence or right-wing violence was a bigger problem. And a  CBS News-YouGov poll  this month actually showed significantly more Americans called the Republican Party “extreme” (59%) as said the same about the Democratic Party (46%).\n \n\n   \n  The stakes here are huge. To the extent Trump can turn this into reality in Americans’ minds, it opens the door to all kinds of powers he craves. That’s not just when it comes to militarizing US soil, but also wielding heavy-handed tools to crack down on the political left, as he’s made clear he’d very much like to do.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday begins a new phase in this high-stakes moment for our country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/trump-tomahawk-missiles-ukraine-white-house-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-20:30","title":"Trump denies Ukraine Tomahawk missiles, urges both sides to ‘stop the war immediately’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump denied Ukraine's request for Tomahawk cruise missiles, which Zelensky had hoped would enable targeted strikes on Russian energy infrastructure.

Trump denies Ukraine Tomahawk missiles, urges both sides to ‘stop the war immediately’ \n       \n  By Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:15 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to obtain Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russia from a meeting with Donald Trump on Friday, with the US president later calling for both sides to cease fighting and accept current battle lines.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky had traveled to Washington hoping to receive the long-range cruise missiles, which he believes could deliver a decisive blow to the Kremlin’s war economy by enabling targeted strikes on oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, during opening remarks at a White House working lunch, Trump expressed  hopes to resolve the war  “without thinking about Tomahawks,” adding that the weapon is one America “needs.”\n \n\n   \n  And Zelensky appeared to come away empty-handed, describing the meeting as “productive” but declining to comment further on Tomahawks because the US “doesn’t want escalation.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, Trump made a public call for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters upon landing in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  “And both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing. And that should be it,” he added, saying that he’d communicated that sentiment to both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting came a day after Trump spoke on the phone with Putin and  agreed to meet him  soon in Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  During that call, Putin is said to have stressed that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield. But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued.\n \n\n   \n    Why is Ukraine seeking Tomahawk missiles?\n \n\n   \n  Tomahawk missiles have a significantly longer range than any others in Ukraine’s current armory.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has  tempered discussions  regarding their delivery, he has not definitely ruled it out.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Friday’s White House meeting, Zelensky appeared to suggest a trade of Ukrainian drones for US Tomahawks.\n \n\n   \n  “Ukraine has thousands of our production drones but we don’t have Tomahawks,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They (US) can have our thousands of drones, that’s where we can work together.”\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky briefed European leaders virtually following his meeting with Trump. The leaders reiterated their “unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters, the Ukrainian leader reaffirmed his trust in Trump wanting to finish the war, adding “it was also difficult to manage the situation in the Middle East, and the president was successful in it.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump stopped short of offering a view on whether Ukraine would need to cede territory as part of a peace settlement with Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has taken divergent stances on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his meeting with Putin in August, he said “land swaps” would be necessary for the war to end.\n \n\n   \n  Later, he changed his mind, saying he believed Ukraine could win back all the territory now occupied by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  In comments Friday, Trump did allow for the possibility that Putin may be stringing him along in a bid to gain time to complete his war aims in Ukraine, but concluded: “I think that he wants to make a deal.”\n \n\n   \n  “You know, I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/weather/severe-storms-tornado-south-midwest-forecast-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00-04:30","title":"Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes threaten South and Midwest this weekend","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes, and large hail are threatening parts of the South and Midwest, particularly northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and into Arkansas and the Mississippi Valley, this weekend.

Storms riding the jet stream can turn severe anytime southerly winds pull up warm, humid air from the Gulf. Gulf waters are unusually warm right now, adding an extra punch of moisture to this weekend’s setup.\n \n\n   \n  The South and, occasionally, lower parts of the Midwest like the Ohio and mid-Mississippi valleys tend to be the regions most affected by severe thunderstorms in fall and winter. In some cases, a major winter storm will dump heavy snow in northern areas, while the South contends with a springlike severe storm threat from the same system.\n \n\n   \n  And with the loss of daylight in those months, there is a greater chance the threat of dangerous storms carries into the evening and overnight hours. Nighttime tornadoes are nearly twice as likely to be deadly than daytime ones, a  2022 study  found.\n \n\n   \n  Colder weather is coming in the weeks and months ahead, but severe storms will no doubt make an appearance at times, so it’s important to stay vigilant and have a preparedness plan in place year-round.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/george-santos-sentence-commuted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"04:05:00-04:05","title":"Trump Commutes Sentence of Former Rep.

George Santos \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:05 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said on social media Friday that he has commuted the sentence of disgraced former Rep. George Santos,  who had been serving a seven-year term  for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress.\n \n\n   \n  “George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” the president wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s commutation comes just months after Santos, 37, surrendered on July 25 to serve  87 months in prison .\n \n\n   \n   Before he surrendered, Santos told Saudi outlet Al Arabiya English that he asked Trump for a pardon but believed he “got stonewalled.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it made it to the president,” Santos said of his pardon request at the time. “Unfortunately, gatekeepers have blockaded for it to ever get to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  But even from behind bars, Santos continued to make his case.  According to his verified X page , he wrote an open letter to Trump earlier this week, pleading for “fairness” while also saying he takes “full responsibility” for his actions.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness — for the chance to rebuild. I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires,” Santos wrote in  the letter published in The South Shore Press. \n \n\n   \n  The law firm that represented Santos celebrated the president’s move, telling CNN, “We applaud the President for correcting this injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Joseph Murray  posted on X  a message on behalf of Santos thanking GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -who he said “fought like a lion” for him – as well as  Lauren Boebert , Anna Paulina Luna, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, whom he described as “in regular contact.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos also expressed gratitude to “the greatest DOJ team ever assembled”, specifically naming Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Associated Deputy AG Diego Pestana, and US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, among other. Martin  wrote on X  he was “honored” to have played “a small role” in Trump granting “clemency” to Santos, and thanked the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the commutation drew mixed reaction from lawmakers. Taylor Greene — who wrote a letter to Trump in August asking him to commute Santos’ sentence — also thanked the president in a  post on X , adding that Santos “was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, slammed Trump for focusing on Santos instead of Americans’ health care — an issue at the center of the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has time to free serial fraudster George Santos from prison. But he can’t be bothered to address the Republican healthcare crisis crushing working class Americans,” Jeffries said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the former congressman pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud charges stemming from activity during his 2022 midterm campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I deeply regret my conduct,” Santos said in court at that time. “I accept full responsibility for my actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023, before completing a full term in the US House – becoming only the sixth lawmaker ever to be expelled from the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  During his short time in Congress, reports emerged of Santos having fabricated parts of his biography, including his employment history and education. He  eventually admitted to  doing that.\n \n\n   \n  Santos represented parts of Long Island and Queens and attempted to run in another New York district before pleading guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Santos had been serving out his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey, per the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/israel-receives-hostage-body-from-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:21:00Z","title":"Body of Tenth Hostage Returned to Israel Identified, Kibbutz Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a civilian hostage killed in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, has been identified and returned to Israel from Gaza via the Red Cross.

leads Los Angeles Dodgers to another World Series, sweeping Milwaukee in 4 games \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:04 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s once again Sho-time in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The Los Angeles Dodgers will have a chance to defend their World Series title in this year’s Fall Classic after a Game 4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, clinching a four-game sweep in the National League Championship Series. The Dodgers were led by their otherworldly star, Shohei Ohtani, who hit three home runs, struck out 10 batters and got the win for the Dodgers.\n \n\n   \n  It was one of the greatest individual performances in the history of the game, let alone on a stage of this magnitude. Ohtani, the Japanese two-way star who has been breaking boundaries since he joined the league, looked sterling in a six-inning, shutout performance.\n \n\n   \n  And then when he walked to the plate to do something no other player does in Major League Baseball these days – hitting while being a starting pitcher – Ohtani helped himself out. He hit home runs in the first, fourth and seventh innings, with the last one sending his teammates into hysterics.\n \n\n   \n  According to MLB statistician Sarah Langs, Ohtani became the first player in league history to hit three home runs and strike out at least one batter, let alone 10. Per the TNT Sports broadcast, Ohtani became the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit a leadoff home run in the regular season or the playoffs, and the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game.\n \n\n   \n  All of those incredible superlatives come with one other amazing fact, given that starting pitchers usually thrive on a regular five-day schedule for starts: It was the first time Ohtani had pitched in 13 days.\n \n\n   \n  He was, quite obviously, named the NLCS MVP for his performance.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really fun on both sides of ball today,” Ohtani said via his translator while holding the NLCS MVP trophy. “As a representative, I am taking this trophy and let’s get four more wins.”\n \n\n   \n  Far from the home runs that baseball fans are used to seeing from pitchers, Ohtani’s blasts were absolutely majestic. He led off the game for the Dodgers with a 427-foot blast, hit a gigantic 469-foot homer in the fourth and topped it off with another mega 446-foot blast in the seventh.\n \n\n   \n  “We won it as a team and this is really a team effort so I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world can enjoy a really good sake,” Ohtani added.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the fifth time in the last nine seasons that the Dodgers have won the National League pennant, the 26th trip to the World Series in their history.\n \n\n   \n  “Oh my God. I’m still speechless,” Dodger first baseman Freddie Freeman said of his teammate’s performance in an interview with the TNT broadcast after the game.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to check him and make sure he’s not made of steel when he does something like that. Absolutely incredible. The biggest stage and he goes and does something like that. It’ll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani Game.”\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani’s game drew the admiration from another Dodgers star, Clayton Kershaw.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know about Shohei but until you play with him and you see him, it’s just a different level,” said Kershaw, the team’s future hall of famer who is coming out of the bullpen in the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  With the Seattle Mariners taking a 3-2 lead in the American League Championship Series over the Toronto Blue Jays earlier in the night, the Dodgers will have to wait to find out who their opponent will be in the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  But whoever the American League champion is will be facing a buzzsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers have lost just one game in this postseason and their pitching hasn’t allowed more than one run per game since a loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Divisional Series more than a week ago. Starters Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani make up one of the most formidable playoff rotations in recent memory and their lineup with Ohtani at the top followed by stars like Mookie Betts, Freeman, Teoscar Hernandez and a slew of others.\n \n\n   \n  “Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” manager Dave Roberts said to an applauding crowd on hand at Dodger Stadium. “Let’s get four more wins and really ruin baseball.”\n \n\n   \n  No team has repeated as World Series champions since the New York Yankees dynasty of the last 1990s and early 2000s won three straight titles between 1998 and 2000. The Dodgers are the first team to even make it back to the World Series the year after winning it since the Phillies did it in the late 2000s.\n \n\n   \n  Kershaw is one of the few players still in the league who was playing when the Phillies made that run. He’s on his last go-round now, retiring after the season and is relishing the opportunity to make history.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to be a part of this team … I’m so happy to be a part of it. This group of guys is awesome, we have a blast and we’re playing so good. It’s just awesome. Whether I get to pitch or not, I’m just glad I get to be a part of it. It’s so fun.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/alaska-storm-damage-evacuees-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00.000-04:00","title":"Alaska storm damage so bad many evacuees won’t go home for at least 18 months, governor says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful storm, the remnants of Typhoon Halong, struck remote Alaskan villages with the force of a Category 2 hurricane, causing catastrophic flooding that destroyed up to 90% of homes in Kipnuk and left over one-third of homes in Kwigillingok uninhabitable.

Mike Dunleavy said in a request to the White House for a major disaster declaration.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the hardest hit villages, Kipnuk, an initial assessment showed that 121 homes — or 90% of the total — have been destroyed, Dunleavy wrote. In Kwigillingok, where three dozen homes floated away, slightly more than one-third of the residences are uninhabitable.\n \n\n   \n  The remnants of Typhoon Halong struck the area with the ferocity of a Category 2 hurricane, Dunleavy said, sending a surge of high surf into the low-lying region. One person was killed, two remain missing, and rescue crews plucked dozens of people from their homes as they floated away.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have been scrambling to  airlift people  from the inundated Alaska Native villages. More than 2,000 people across the region have taken shelter — in schools in their villages, in larger communities in southwest Alaska or have been evacuated by military planes to Anchorage, the state’s largest city.\n \n\n   \n  Anchorage leaders said Friday they expect as many as 1,600 evacuees to arrive. So far about 575 have been airlifted to the city by the Alaska National Guard, and have been staying at a sports arena or a convention center. Additional flights were expected Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are working on figuring out how to move people out of shelters and into short-term accommodations, such as hotels, and then longer-term housing.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the time, space, distance, geography, and weather in the affected areas, it is likely that many survivors will be unable to return to their communities this winter,” Dunleavy said. “Agencies are prioritizing rapid repairs … but it is likely that some damaged communities will not be viable to support winter occupancy, in America’s harshest climate in the U.S. Arctic.”\n \n\n   \n  The federal government already has been assisting with search and rescue, damage assessments, environmental response and evacuation support. A major disaster declaration by President Donald Trump could provide federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including money for emergency and permanent work.\n \n\n   \n  The three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to Trump, urging swift approval.\n \n\n   \n  The storm surge pummeled a sparsely populated region off the state’s main road system where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year. The villages typically have just a few hundred residents, who hunt and fish for much of their food, and relocating to the state’s major cities will bring a vastly different lifestyle.\n \n\n   \n  Alexie Stone, of Kipnuk, arrived in Anchorage in a military jet with his brothers, children and mom, after his home was struck by the flooding. They’ve been staying at the Alaska Airlines Center at the University of Alaska, where the Red Cross provided evacuees with cots, blankets and hygiene supplies.\n \n\n   \n  At least for the foreseeable future, he thinks he might try to find a job at a grocery store; he used to work in one in Bethel.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be, try to look for a place and find a job,” Stone said Friday. “We’re starting a new life here in Anchorage.”\n \n\n   \n  Anchorage officials and business leaders said Friday they were eager to help the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our neighbors in western Alaska have experienced tremendous loss, devastation and grief,” Mayor Suzanne LaFrance said at a meeting of the Anchorage Assembly. “We will do everything we can here in Anchorage to welcome our neighbors and help them through these difficult times.”\n \n\n   \n  State Rep. Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, of Toksook Bay, on an island northwest of Kipnuk, described for the assembly how she rode out the storm’s 100 mph (161 kmh) winds with her daughter and niece.\n \n\n   \n  “We had no choice but to sit in our home and wait to see if our house is going to come off the foundation or if debris is going to bust open our windows,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t, but others weren’t as fortunate. She thanked Anchorage for welcoming the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “You are showing my people, my relatives, my constituents, even if they are far from home, this is still Alaska land and they’re amongst families,” Jimmie said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/trump-maduro-tensions-venezuela-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump and Maduro Are Amassing Military Forces as Tensions Build in the Caribbean","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As President Donald Trump intensifies pressure on Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro through military actions—such as deploying B-52 bombers and authorizing CIA covert operations—the Venezuelan leader is responding with mass military mobilizations, claiming over 8 million militia members and denouncing U.S. interference.

\nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President  Donald Trump  weighs military action inside Venezuela, building up forces in the Caribbean and  flying B-52 bombers  off the country’s coast this week,  Nicolás Maduro  is responding in kind, repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia and denouncing US activity in the region – a sign of defiance from the strongman as the two leaders are locked in a standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have privately acknowledged that the  intensifying US pressure campaign  is aimed at ousting Maduro, a goal that was also a target of Trump’s first term in office when the White House recognized Venezuelan  opposition leader Juan Guaidó  as the legitimate president of the country in 2019. But as the Trump team ratchets up the pressure this fall, Maduro has in turn ramped up the rhetoric and propaganda for Venezuelans while calling for new military exercises by the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, which has some 123,000 members.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, the US military has  moved warships  and other weaponry into the region and has  targeted boats  off the Venezuelan coast it says are transporting drugs. Then on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he’d  authorized the CIA  to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the United States was considering strikes on Venezuelan territory.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training. As of October 17, 20 out of 23 Venezuelan states have been militarized as part of the Maduro’s military mobilizations, called Independence 200.\n \n\n   \n  On his Truth Social account last month, Trump mocked a video of women, some who appeared to be overweight, running with guns during a purported training for the Venezuelan militia.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not. The recent strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean are a clear message to Maduro, the sources said, noting the administration has been very intentional about linking the Venezuelan leader to trafficking groups and cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying they would be attempting to remove Maduro. The remarks are Trump’s most expansive comments on his decision to expand the CIA’s authority to conduct lethal targeting and carry out covert action in the region, which  CNN first reported  last week.\n \n\n   \n  In a televised speech Wednesday, Maduro denounced what he described as the CIA’s record of regime change and coups d’état around the world.\n \n\n   \n  “But our people are clear, united, and aware. They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela,” he said on state television.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We don’t sleep well’\n \n\n   \n  In Venezuela, daily life has continued despite the looming possibility of armed conflict with the United States. Near downtown Caracas, at the Teresa Carreño Theater, a sold-out musical premiered just days after a well-known salsa party brought together more than 1,000 people in the west of the city.\n \n\n   \n  But Venezuelans are increasingly discussing the US warships in the Caribbean Sea and the fear of a possible US attack. “Venezuelans live in anxiety thinking about what might happen,” said Ivonne Caña.\n \n\n   \n  Caña, who is a cook, said she lives in uncertainty and, worried about her family, has been buying a little more food than usual to stock up at home. The fear, she said, is felt most at night: “We don’t sleep well.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Venezuelans are cautiously showing their support for the US pressure on Maduro. In recent days, banners bearing messages such as “It’s happening… freedom loading 95%” have been displayed on at least 10 university campuses across the country — a form of peaceful protest in spaces where political issues are seldom addressed due to fear of government reprisal.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Maduro has further cracked down on civil liberties in Venezuela. At the end of September, the government announced that the president had signed a decree of “external commotion,” which he described as “a constitutional defense tool in case the country faces a military aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  The state of emergency decree would allow Maduro to restrict constitutional guarantees and, according to analysts, would grant him broad political, social and economic powers.\n \n\n   \n  As Maduro has accused the US administration of trying to steal the country’s oil wealth, the nearby American military presence has drawn closer. Three US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours on Wednesday, according to open-source flight data reviewed by CNN. The bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  Two of them kept their location beacons activated inside Venezuela’s flight information region (FIR), at one point coming within 53 miles of La Orchila Island, where Maduro’s forces carried out drills last month.\n \n\n   \n  At their closest point, the planes flew 132 miles from the Venezuelan mainland, at around 11:20 a.m. local time. The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela’s flight information region that is international airspace but controlled by the country’s aviation authority. Venezuela’s FIR extends far beyond the country’s airspace.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple sources told CNN that the recent US military strikes on drug boats are just the beginning of a larger effort to rid the region of narcotics trafficking and potentially dislodge Maduro from power. The military has carried out at least six  strikes to date  on six separate boats in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    The Trump administration’s war on drugs\n \n\n   \n  The argument that drug traffickers pose an imminent threat to Americans is at the core of the Trump administration’s classified legal justification for carrying out military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean — and potentially beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department opinion also includes a secret and expansive list of groups the Trump administration argues can now be treated as enemy combatants, rather than criminals, and thus summarily killed without due process at the president’s direction.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts said, because it appears to  justify an open-ended war against a secret list of groups  and potentially offers a pretext for unilateral US military action against a broad array of targets in the region.\n \n\n   \n  At the Pentagon, some military lawyers, including international law experts within DoD’s Office of General Counsel, have raised concerns about the legality of the lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers, sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  But multiple Pentagon lawyers previously told CNN that internal dissent is unlikely to dissuade the Trump administration from continuing its military campaign in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The latest indication of internal concerns over these strikes emerged on Thursday when the admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean,  announced he is retiring  just one year into his tenure.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions had been simmering between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean, and he complained about not being given the information he needed about the operations, the sources said. But SOUTHCOM was concerned about the operations not being lawful, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  Then, on Friday, the US military detained two survivors of its sixth known strike of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. This is the first time an American strike has not immediately killed everyone on board, and the two survivors, CNN has reported, are  currently detained on a US Navy vessel , raising a host of new legal questions to an already murky picture.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/americas/made-in-guatemala-working-conditions-as-equals-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"The truth behind your clothing’s ‘made in Guatemala’ label","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals widespread labor exploitation in Guatemala's maquila garment factories, where workers—mostly women—face brutal conditions, including long hours, daily quotas, sexual harassment, and wage theft, while being largely invisible to US brands.

Video by Lali Houghton, Ladan Anoushfar, Estefania Rodriguez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the bracing morning air, workers leave their homes in the outer suburbs and hurry toward the industrial buildings lining the Guatemalan capital’s highways.\n \n\n   \n  Some go by foot. Others by motorcycle; whole families on the school commute, children in their mothers’ arms. Many more travel on old yellow school buses, imported from the United States after decades of service.\n \n\n   \n  The workers are almost entirely women, ranging from their late teens to early 60s. They stream into factory buildings past heavy metal gates and 10-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\n \n\n   \n  What happens inside these garment factories, known as “maquilas” throughout Central America, is largely hidden from public view – even though they employ tens of thousands of workers and are crucial to Guatemala’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Cameras and other recording devices are not allowed inside, several of the workers told CNN. Independent inspectors are hamstrung by factory bosses, according to government officials. Trade unions are few and attempts to organize are met with threats, firings and, in some cases, violence, the workers said.\n \n\n   \n  What does emerge from these factories is box after box of garments overwhelmingly destined for the US: clothes for some of the biggest brands in North America, such as Carhartt, Target and Ralph Lauren, among others.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of nearshoring policies pursued by successive US administrations, Guatemala has become an integrated hub for cheap apparel – and some of the consequences for the local workforce have been brutal.\n \n\n   \n  A months-long investigation by CNN gathered dozens of testimonies of workplace abuse. Workers spoke of public dressing-downs and threats to fire staff unable to fulfill impossible quotas, wage theft and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n  Some maquila workers told CNN they were given daily quotas of thousands of apparel items, and made to stand for up to 15 hours a day, while earning a minimum wage of less than $500 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t keep up, they flag you out, they discipline you,” said one worker, Rosa Guerra. “They ask us to hurry up and say that they cannot pay us.”\n \n\n   \n  Others described deplorable working conditions: “The (drinking) water was dirty. Sometimes it even had soap or cockroaches in it,” said Merida Jacinto.\n \n\n   \n  But dissent is not an option for the vast majority of maquila workers. Of the more than 850 textile maquilas in Guatemala, only 76 allow a workers’ union, Labor Minister Miriam Roquel told CNN. That’s about 9% of factories.\n \n\n   \n  Guatemala has long been a cheap supplier for US companies. But maquilas took on an increasingly central role during the Covid-19 pandemic, when lockdowns meant many containers sat idle in East Asian ports for months – and US manufacturers looked to production closer to home. Between 2019 and 2022, apparel imports from Guatemala grew 37%, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.\n \n\n   \n  The sector now counts for almost 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, and is so crucial to the economy it was granted an exemption to continue operating during Covid-19 restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Guatemala City, as the light begins to fade from the skyline, the maquila workers emerge from their factories. Now, some are ready to share their stories of the world inside.\n \n\n   \n    What a lifetime of maquila work looks like\n \n\n   \n  Rutilia Cano had worked for the same garment factory for 23 years – until she was abruptly made jobless in February.\n \n\n   \n  An indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands, Cano never learnt to read and moved to the capital as a young mother in the 1980s to escape the violent civil conflict between the Guatemalan Army and leftist guerrillas that caused the death of tens of thousands of Maya civilians between the 1960s and the early 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Working in the textile industry was the only job she could land, and the pace of work was brutal. “We were asked to make some 300 t-shirts an hour, but I never managed to,” Cano, now in her late fifties, told CNN. “I’m old, I could only get to 150, 175 t-shirts maybe, and the managers were always coming after me.”\n \n\n   \n  Her dream was to one day return to her village and purchase land to build a house. But for more than three decades her home has been a rundown apartment with a plastic curtain as a door.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of her fellow workers, Cano was never able to purchase the fruits of her labor. The t-shirts, skirts and more that she made at the factory – owned by Korean company KOA Modas – were supplied to US retailer Target and sold abroad. Throughout her employment Cano was never under contract with Target, who – as a third-party client – was not responsible for her layoff. Target used an intermediary to purchase garments from KOA Modas, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  On a rare visit to a large department store that sells international brands, Cano ran her strong hands shaped by a lifetime of sewing along the hanging rails of clothes. “It would take me days to afford what is on offer here,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the garment factories here are run by Korean companies, who control almost two-thirds of investments in the Guatemalan textile industry, according to a 2022 report by USAID.\n \n\n   \n  In this intricate supply chain, US brands do not have formal relationships with most of the Guatemalan workers who manufacture garments on their behalf, nor are they legally responsible for the working conditions inside the maquilas.\n \n\n   \n  However, they benefit from a pattern of sub-contracting deals that keep prices down and deliveries running unabated, advocates have said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a company fact sheet, big US brand Ralph Lauren purchases from 17 facilities across Guatemala, some of which are owned by Korean companies. Ralph Lauren did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on its supplier relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Mother-of-three Cano had been looking forward to retiring one day and spending more time with her family. But in February, that future was upended when Cano’s factory declared bankruptcy. Labor inspectors told her the factory’s ownership had left millions of dollars in outstanding payments to the Guatemalan welfare agency. Cano’s pension was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “I was due some 80-90,000 quetzales ($11,000)… and nothing. I feel so sad because we all lost our jobs, even me, a single mother. It’s just sad…” Cano told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Target told CNN suppliers are required to comply with lawful, safe and respectful working conditions and that the company decided to end the relationship with KOA Modas because the factory did not comply with its standards.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to KOA Modas for comment, but did not receive a response at time of publishing.\n \n\n   \n  After the factory closed, Cano joined litigation involving Sae-A Trading, another Korean company which used to purchase KOA Modas’s apparel on Target’s behalf and, after a lengthy legal battle, pledged to fulfill the vast majority of severance payments.\n \n\n   \n  While Sae-A Trading has no legal responsibility for the workers, it agreed to make a “humanitarian contribution” to those affected by the closure, it said in a resolution document. Its contribution of $3.3million is “considered a loan,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Such severances are “by far the largest single sum of money most of these families will ever see in their lives,” Scott Nova, executive director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a US-based organization that investigates the garment industry, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He said it was common in the industry for workers not to receive their pension, adding “it’s difficult to put into words how financially and psychologically devastating it is to work 20 years to earn this one sizable, real pot of money, and then just have it taken from you.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN last spoke with Cano in late September, she was still waiting to be paid under the settlement with Sae-A Trading. “I need that money,” she told CNN, adding “at my age I’m struggling to get work – the only thing I could do is cleaning houses but that is very tiring.”\n \n\n   \n    A culture of fear\n \n\n   \n  For other maquila workers, simply joining their factory’s trade union – if it even exists – can be met with trepidation.\n \n\n   \n  Corina Olivares is one of the union representatives at the Texpia II factory, also owned by Sae-A Trading. She took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was shot dead outside of Guatemala City in June last year.\n \n\n   \n  In the months leading up to Caal’s death, obscenity-ridden threats appeared on the walls of workers’ toilets, which CNN has seen photos of. “Unionists, son of b****es, resign or we will lynch you,” read one, with the stylized image of a revolver mimicking a signature. “Unionist b**ch, go to sh*t don’t mess with the factory, be grateful it’s given you to eat for many years,” read another.\n \n\n   \n  While the US Department of Labor implied Caal’s murder was linked to his union activity, Olivares wasn’t so certain. However, she added, the threats made her seriously question whether to run as his successor: “For months, I was genuinely scared to walk to work,” she said. Olivares told CNN that the company blamed the union – which had campaigned for reduced working hours and clean drinking water being made available between shifts – for a contraction in trade. The resulting hostility from other workers toward union members made her feel unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Texpia II confirmed that threatening graffiti appeared between May and June last year but stressed that factory’s management took actions to condemn the threats and support union activities.\n \n\n   \n  Any form of verbal abuse or personal harassment is not tolerated at Texpia II, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, VESTEX, the civil association representing the textile export industry in Guatemala, said in a statement to CNN that the group’s Code of Conduct strictly bans verbal and physical abuse, including corporal punishment, coercion and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n    Power dynamics and sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n  Inside factories, the balance of power between the male-dominated management and the mostly female workers can lead to another disturbing problem.\n \n\n   \n  Worker Laura, who chose to remain anonymous, described how one manager would touch her inappropriately at work. “I knew it was not okay, but I was too scared to speak out,” she told CNN. “I didn’t know that inside a maquila, female workers were so exposed to the middle managers, as if a man who thinks he’s superior to us can dominate in such a way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Another worker, Alexandra, who also preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN of a manager who sexually harassed her for years. “He would come toward me from my back in a really creepy way, putting his hands on my neck, touching me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When she rejected his advances, Alexandra said the manager would change her shifts, and scold and insult her in front of other workers.\n \n\n   \n  When Alexandra and her colleagues complained about sexual and workplace abuse, she told CNN that the answer from upper managers was always that they were free to leave.\n \n\n   \n  In reality, Alexandra had few options but to stay on, telling CNN that she could not afford to be unemployed, and resigning would have meant giving up her severance pay.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory sells almost exclusively to the US market. Past clients include Carhartt, which told CNN it parted ways with the factory in 2019, though it does continue to purchase from Guatemala more broadly.\n \n\n   \n    Powerless to intervene\n \n\n   \n  Instead of quitting, Alexandra decided to join a workers’ union. The group relayed the abuse to the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor. But when labor inspectors were sent to the factory earlier this year, the company’s management refused to meet with them, video seen by CNN shows.\n \n\n   \n  The following week, all the members of the union were laid off.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, the Ministry of Labor has continued to engage with the company, with no results. “(More recently) We tried to enter that maquila with our inspectors to register the workers’ conditions,” labor inspector Silvia Juarez told CNN. “We simply couldn’t: the management barricaded behind a shut door and we would need police intervention to break through,” she told CNN, gritting her teeth.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory did not respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN. However, the textile factories trade association VESTEX, told CNN in a statement that the group works hand in hand with the labor inspectorate to make sure regulations are respected.\n \n\n   \n  The Guatemalan president, Bernardo Arévalo, is the first progressive leader to be elected in the country in decades. His inauguration in 2024, after years of political malaise, raised hopes that rampant corruption and chronic malpractices could finally be reined in. But change is taking longer than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “What has been lacking in Guatemala is the political will to make public institutions work,” the president told CNN, a nod to the abuse in the maquila sector that has been infamous since at least the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage for maquila workers by 6% and has pledged to do more to enforce existing regulation. But as the labor ministry’s inability to engage with shows, the state can do only so much.\n \n\n   \n  Months after their dismissal, most of the workers fired along with Alexandra told CNN they were getting by doing odd jobs and had struggled to find a new employer – their membership in the union apparently a stain in the eyes of other maquila   owners.\n \n\n   \n  The future for these maquila workers feels even more uncertain as the White House has imposed import tariffs on several countries that play a key role in the supply chain, leaving textile workers around the world exposed. The impact of those tariffs is yet to be felt in Guatemala, but other countries such as Lesotho and Haiti are already facing a bleak outcome.\n \n\n   \n  Prachi Agarwal, a research fellow at the ODI think tank, has written about a “gendered supply chain shock” as the vast majority of the workforce in the global garment industry are women.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra meanwhile has decided to cut ties with the sector altogether. She hopes her daughter – who is studying law – will have a brighter career.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never want my daughter to work in a maquila. Ever,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Credits\n \n\n   \n  Reporter: Stefano Pozzebon\n \n\n   \n  Editor: Sheena McKenzie\n \n\n   \n  Cameraperson: Lali Houghton\n \n\n   \n  Video editor: Estefania Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Field producer: Sofia Menchú\n \n\n   \n  Commissioning editor: Ladan Anoushfar\n \n\n   \n  Copy editor:   Andy Raine\n \n\n   \n  Associate Producer: Marta Simonella\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/europe/us-ukraine-russia-tomahawk-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:13:00-17:10","title":"Trump meeting brings good news for Zelensky, but Kyiv’s real prize remains out of reach – for now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite Trump's initial threat to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles—raising fears of escalation—his subsequent statements suggest a preference for a ceasefire along current battle lines, offering some hope for peace.

     11:13 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The relationship between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky has unquestionably improved but the real prize Kyiv seeks seems out of its reach, for now.\n \n\n   \n  After nine months of extraordinary diplomatic acrobatics and verbiage, Trump still prefers to give Russian President Vladimir Putin yet another chance to talk him around, over blunt military escalation.\n \n\n   \n  But there were – among the fawning compliments and the conviction an elusive peace was near – bits of good news for Ukraine. Even Trump’s final word on the matter, a Truth Social post delivered as he left for Mar-a-Lago, suggested “They should stop where they are” – a ceasefire along current battle lines, suggesting something Kyiv could very much tolerate.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to stop where we are. This is important, to stop where we are, and then to speak,” Zelensky told CNN during a news conference after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the day could have gone a lot worse for Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  First, Trump extolled the deadly virtues of the Tomahawks, the supply of which he said his meeting with Zelensky was all about. “That is why we are here,” he said. “Tomahawks are very dangerous… It could mean escalation – a lot of bad things could happen.” This is a threat unimaginable when Trump first came to power: the president contentedly signaling he might give the cream of his arsenal to Zelensky so Ukraine can strike deep into Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Yet at the same time, Trump undermined his own threat, by immediately making the nature of the deal before Putin clear. “Hopefully we will be able to get this war over with without thinking about Tomahawks,” Trump added. “I think we are pretty close to that.”\n \n\n   \n  The truth is, Trump is likely still far from the deal he called “Number 9,” a reference to the number of peace agreements around the world he claims to have had a hand in. But his new approach – of threatening real military escalation, through US technology purchased by European allies and then supplied to Ukraine – might, over time, bring closer the deal he still says Putin wants.\n \n\n   \n  The threat is as psychological as it is military. The US lacks the inventory to provide the “thousands” of Tomahawks Trump said he joked with Putin on Thursday he might give Ukraine. The missiles are normally sea-launched, and so at best Ukraine would have to wait months to receive a few dozen that it would have to adapt to launch on land.\n \n\n   \n  They are remarkably expensive. Their range is not much greater than the drones Ukraine currently fires nightly deep into Russia. If it used them, Kyiv would have to hit targets worth the Tomahawk’s $2 million price tag – which means hitting serious military or government infrastructure, something Trump might veto. Trump and Zelensky appeared to have agreed to leave their arrangements ambiguous: Zelensky declined to offer any details on their Tomahawk conversation, saying the US did not want escalation. Asked if he was optimistic or pessimistic on the missiles, he replied he was “realistic.”\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, Trump is now unafraid to admit Putin might be playing him – an important, if overdue, epiphany. He added: “I have been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n  The Budapest summit with Putin still lacks a concrete date, and appears another moment in which the Kremlin may seek to buy yet more time. But Putin will meet a US president perhaps wiser to his own flaws in dealing with the Kremlin head, and what is required to get Moscow’s attention. Trump has now heeded the advice of European allies: Putin most clearly responds to force.\n \n\n   \n  Whether Trump ever makes good on this threat arguably matters less in the changing dynamics of the conflict itself. Zelensky sat before Trump in a position few observers imagined possible in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  As Putin’s much-vaunted summer offensive rattles on into fall, it has singularly failed to capture any eastern town of importance. That may change in the scant remaining weeks ahead of winter in November. But the intense grind, loss and cost of the summer months has still left Pokrovsk, Kupiansk and Kostyantynivka in Ukrainian hands. Kyiv’s grip is precarious, and the Russian advances across open land and through tiny villages leave Ukraine poorly placed for winter. But Kyiv’s key positions, remarkably, for the most part, held.\n \n\n   \n  Given the crises of manpower, resources and morale looming over Ukraine in May, this is startling, and potentially flips the dynamics of the months ahead. Putin has again played his military cards, and not (yet) achieved his goals. In weeks, winter will strip the foliage bare and make it harder for Russian infantry to advance, concealed under the leaves against the threat of Kyiv’s drones.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has again defied expectations, partly due to grit and sacrifice, but also because, as Trump conceded: “They make a very good drone.” These new dynamics may yet change.\n \n\n   \n  But, for the Kremlin, pressure for results is edging towards an uncomfortable need to explain recent failures.\n \n\n   \n  Can Putin afford to fight all winter, through spring, into the fourth summer, to again aim for increasingly minimalist objectives? Gas shortages from Ukrainian strikes on oil refineries, rising inflation, vacillating sign-up payments for new military recruits, and Moscow’s consistent failure to make a real breakthrough, suggest he can’t.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has survived a spring and summer in which Ukraine’s main ally turned on him and tried – without Kyiv - to strike a peace deal with its enemy. Ukraine has seen Europe step financially and militarily into the void left by America, and then seen the same recalcitrant White House offer them its best missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky used to be the global salesman of the case to support Ukraine’s defense and let it become a NATO member. Now he travels around NATO members, pitching to them up-to-date, fast-evolving Ukrainian drone technology.\n \n\n   \n  Recent changes are less comforting for Putin. Yes, China still has his back, but India is surely paying a price from the US secondary sanctions imposed over its purchases of Russian oil. (Trump suggested India had decided to stop buying Russian oil on Friday, which  much reporting  suggests isn’t the case).\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s plan, and support base, depends upon a military win. Putin has yet to achieve that. He may do – remarkably – in the weeks ahead, given late October’s propensity to bring sweeping battlefield change in this war.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the capability of Russia’s closed, autocratic society to suppress dissent, one question is becoming loudest for Putin: “What is your next move?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-04:00","title":"Lindsey Halligan fires more prosecutors in key US attorney’s office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Lindsey Halligan, a Trump-appointed interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has fired several senior prosecutors, including Beth Yusi and Kristin Bird, citing allegations of unauthorized leaks to the press.

Multiple other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:41 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  After a meeting at the White House Friday, the University of Virginia declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and a total of five schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  USC, Penn, Brown University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Other schools – a mix of public and private universities – have either said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an unprecedented level of control over universities – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  The schools that received the initial letters, according to a White House official, include: Vanderbilt University, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, University of Arizona, Brown University and University of Virginia. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs, and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  Of the nine universities that the officials said were sent the letter, five have formally responded by declining the offer – MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC and the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  Friday, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said.

Gavin Newsom previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n   Vanderbilt University  and the University of Arizona have said they are reviewing the compact, with Arizona’s president saying the “proposal has generated a wide range of reactions and perspectives.” Neither of the schools have indicated if they are planning to sign on or not.\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College President Sian Leah Beilock  didn’t say what the school’s official course of action will be , but noted that the school “will never compromise our academic freedom and our ability to govern ourselves.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. They didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/chicago-immigration-crackdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"19:12:00Z","title":"Frenzy of developments cement Chicago as epicenter of immigration crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chicago has become the epicenter of a national controversy over the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, triggered by Operation Midway Blitz, which led to over 1,000 arrests in Illinois.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:12 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with protesters,  Chicago  is being cemented as the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of developments in the last 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Now – with the city heading into its first weekend since a fence outside the Broadview immigration enforcement facility has come down, and with the director of   Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s   Chicago field office ordered to appear in court Monday – the stage is set for a reckoning on crowd-control measures.\n \n\n   \n  Several developments on Thursday put the Windy City under the national spotlight, including a federal appeals court upholding a lower court’s ruling temporarily denying the federal government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois and a judge separately  demanding answers  on violent encounters with protesters in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions have flared as  federal agents were deployed  across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  The ICE building in Broadview, outside Chicago, has been the site of multiple confrontations as protesters have come out to decry the immigration arrests. Meanwhile,  DHS  has said it “won’t let this violence deter us from arresting the worst of the worst and making Illinois safe again.”\n \n\n   \n  Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  A small group of protesters that remained outside the facility Friday evening were ordered by authorities to disperse at 6 p.m. per a  curfew  put in place earlier this month by Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson.\n \n\n   \n  It came a day after 13 people were arrested in a federal raid at a Chicago flea market, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday. Those arrested are “illegal aliens with criminal histories including DUI, battery causing bodily harm, and domestic violence,” the department said in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a roundup of what has transpired in the Windy City area ahead of more planned anti-ICE protests on Friday and a  second ‘No Kings’  rally and march planned for Saturday, with more than 75,000 expected to attend.\n \n\n   \n    Federal judge orders use of body cameras\n \n\n   \n  One week after issuing a  sweeping order  trying to quell the intense response of federal agents to protests against immigration enforcement activities in Chicago, US District Judge Sara Ellis told attorneys on both sides of the case to come back to her courtroom to have their own discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she had “serious concerns” about her order being followed and eventually announced she will be expanding her restraining order and will require all federal agents involved in the immigration crackdown in Chicago to have body cameras on when encountering protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras but agreed to some flexibility after an attorney representing the Trump administration said it would be logistically impossible to immediately provide all agents with the cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice still opposed the body camera order, arguing it’s not a simple matter to record the videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis also demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic US Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin on Friday called on ICE and Customs and Border Protection to enforce body camera requirements in compliance with the federal order, saying the footage “plays a vital role in promoting responsible law enforcement tactics and verifying DHS accounts against facts on the ground and, ultimately, is in the best interest of agents, officials and individuals involved in use of force incidents.”\n \n\n   \n    Order bars ICE from county property\n \n\n   \n  An  executive order , signed Thursday by the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, prohibits ICE from using county-owned “property, resources, and personnel for civil immigration enforcement activities,” including staging for and debriefing from enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The new order builds on prior resolutions and a 2011 county ordinance that prohibits the use of county facilities and personnel time for ICE investigations without a criminal warrant.\n \n\n   \n  “Local law enforcement and County employees rely on public trust to effectively serve residents. Allowing federal civil immigration operations on County property would erode that trust, discourage cooperation with public safety agencies, and jeopardize the sense of security that all residents deserve,” a  release  from the county about the order said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to ICE for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Federal vehicle moved more than 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  The federal vehicle that American citizen  Marimar Martinez  is accused of ramming earlier this month before she was shot by a CBP agent has been  moved  more than 1,000 miles away to Maine, a Department of Justice attorney said at a Thursday hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney accused the DOJ of moving the vehicle – key evidence in the case – despite knowing he would likely need to examine it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in the case ordered the vehicle be returned via flatbed truck after Martinez’s attorney expressed concern that evidence would not be preserved after it was driven to Maine and back.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, 30, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a charge of assaulting, resisting and impeding officers.\n \n\n   \n  She is accused of ramming the federal law enforcement vehicle with her car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows it was a federal agent who swerved into Martinez.\n \n\n   \n    ICE arrests police officer\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, ICE agents arrested a police officer in the Chicago suburb of Hanover Park, alleging he is an unlawful immigrant from Montenegro.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said the officer, Radule Bojovic, overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Bojovic was “encountered during a targeted enforcement action as part of Operation Midway Blitz,” the department said.\n \n\n   \n  “Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years – what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns? It’s a felony for aliens to even possess a firearm. A law enforcement officer who is actively breaking the law,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Hanover Park Police for comment and has attempted to contact Bojovic.\n \n\n   \n    Appeals court denies effort to deploy National Guard troops\n \n\n   \n  In a loss for the Trump administration, an appellate court on Thursday denied the government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  However, the troops can remain in the state under federal control, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion details the court’s reasoning in a  decision  issued Saturday and comes a week after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a scathing  oral ruling  from Chicago that granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in Illinois for two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said at the time, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n  The denial is the latest in a court saga over whether President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority by deploying troops to quell demonstrations outside ICE facilities near Democratic-led cities like Chicago.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/trump-momentum-gaza-ukraine-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00-20:58","title":"Trump seeks to build on momentum from Gaza deal in a busy diplomatic week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is leveraging momentum from a recently brokered ceasefire in Gaza — which ended a two-year war by securing the release of 20 living hostages — to pursue high-stakes diplomatic initiatives with Russia and China.

 \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:58 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  These are busy days for  Steve Witkoff. \n \n\n   \n  The real estate developer-turned-Swiss Army Knife diplomat (officially the special presidential envoy for peace missions) was sitting in the galleries of the Israeli Knesset on Monday, listening as President Donald Trump basked in the newly brokered ceasefire-for-hostages deal, when his boss reminded him of another assignment.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to get Russia done. We got to get that one done,” Trump said while musing about a new Iran nuclear deal. “If you don’t mind, Steve, let’s focus on Russia first.”\n \n\n   \n  Energized by success in the Middle East, Trump is eager to harness that most elusive ingredient in politics and diplomacy: momentum. A week that began with a 36-hour trip to the Middle East ended with Ukraine’s president in the White House, trying to convince Trump to approve  new long-range missiles  before a surprise meeting soon with  Vladimir Putin in Budapest .\n \n\n   \n  In between, Trump confirmed he’d  authorized the CIA  to operate covertly in Venezuela while threatening to strike inside the country. He threw his endorsement — and a  $20 billion lifeline  from the US Treasury — behind Argentina’s likeminded leader. And he zigzagged through  new China tariff threats  ahead of a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping in a few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we carry a lot of momentum, a lot of credibility. Getting Middle East done was very important,” Trump said Friday over lunch with his Ukrainian counterpart in the Cabinet Room. “Nobody thought it could be done. That was one nobody thought could be done, and we got it done.”\n \n\n   \n  “We had to set the table properly,” he added later. “This should be one that we get done, and I think the table is set properly here now, too, and it’ll be a great honor to get it done.”\n \n\n   \n  Translating his ability to quell the Mideast war into successes elsewhere will be a tall order for the president. And there have already been stumbling blocks in the delicate truce with Hamas, including the militant group’s inability this week to produce the remains of  more than a dozen deceased hostages  and subsequent outrage in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The leverage Trump successfully employed on Israel to stop the war doesn’t exist with Russia and China, both nuclear powers who aren’t dependent on the United States for military or financial support. Many senior US and European officials said this week they doubted Trump’s success in the Middle East would lead to any immediate shift in strategy by Moscow or Beijing. And Trump faces political peril with his interventions in Latin America, where US troops and dollars have a mixed history of either propping up or taking down regimes.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile victory\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s experience with Gaza was a reminder that long stretches of arduous, often fruitless effort can eventually result in a victory, however fragile. As the US diplomat George Mitchell liked to say after brokering the Good Friday agreement to end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success.”\n \n\n   \n  That quote was batted around frequently by aides to President Joe Biden last year as they worked to achieve what Trump eventually did: an agreement to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza while stopping the two-year war. A week after Trump declared the deal done, it appeared to be holding, despite accusations from Israel that Hamas was not maintaining its pledge to return all the hostage bodies.\n \n\n   \n  American officials were quick to explain it would have been nearly impossible for Hamas to quickly locate and extract the bodies from the piles of rubble and debris left behind from the war. One US adviser pointed out the Palestinian enclave lacks any heavy equipment, like bulldozers, to clear out the wreckage. And they emphasized the unquestionable diplomatic success of getting 20 living hostages released.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the understanding we had with them was we get all the live hostage hostages out, which they did honor that,” one US adviser said.\n \n\n   \n  The task of preventing the deal from falling apart has fallen mainly to Witkoff and  Jared Kushner , Trump’s son-in-law, each of whom helped convince Israel and Hamas, via its Arab interlocutors, to agree. In conversations with Israeli officials, they have tried to emphasize the ways in which they are working to locate all the bodies, including calling in teams from Turkey with experience in earthquake recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  After returning in the middle of the night from the region this week, the president himself spoke again on Thursday with Netanyahu about the issue of the hostages’ remains.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to find out if they behave,” he said afterward, referring to Hamas. “If they don’t behave, we’ll take care of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Few believe the issue could derail the deal entirely, and American advisers were pushing ahead with the next phase of the arrangement: establishing a multinational security force and taking steps toward rebuilding Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But the issue underscored the fragility of a deal that was pushed through by Trump before many of the details were finalized. Ultimately,  far stickier questions remain , including getting Hamas to disarm, deciding who will govern Gaza and, most crucially, whether the process results in a Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n    Carrots and sticks\n \n\n   \n  As he turns quickly to Ukraine, Trump may be drawing some lessons from his Middle East negotiations, including the virtues of working rapidly even as major details remain outstanding. This week he agreed to meet soon with Putin in Hungary in another attempt at face-to-face diplomacy, even as the parameters of a peace deal remain entirely unclear.\n \n\n   \n  Some European officials speaking privately this week said if Trump hopes to strike a similar deal to end the Ukraine war, it will require a degree of pressure on Putin — be it new sanctions or supplying new arms to Ukraine — that he so far seems unwilling to exert. Without sticks, Trump may seek to find carrots to lure Putin into a peace deal, although those, too, will be limited compared to what incentives existed with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, in his dealings with Netanyahu, appeared highly attuned to the Israeli prime minister’s political concerns, be it the demands from his far-right coalition partners or his ongoing corruption trial on long-standing bribery and fraud charges. In a remarkable moment during his speech to the Knesset, Trump called for Israel’s president to grant Netanyahu a pardon, brushing aside the accusations the Israeli leader received lavish gifts in exchange for favors.\n \n\n   \n  “Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?” Trump scoffed.\n \n\n   \n  Finding a political lever to pull with Putin will be more difficult. The Russian president rules as an authoritarian, without the political chores required to keep together fragile coalitions or avoiding legal mires (at least in his own country; he’s wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of trafficking Ukrainian children).\n \n\n   \n  That leaves Trump with fewer options to bring Putin to the negotiating table. For much of the last week, Trump seemed to be warming to the idea of sending Ukraine new long-range Tomahawk missiles, whose 1,000-mile range would put Moscow well within striking distance.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky set off for Washington this week hopeful Trump was serious about providing the weapons, which he believes are necessary for turning around the battlefield momentum. He even arranged meetings with representatives from Raytheon, the US manufacturer of the Tomahawks, to discuss his weaponry needs.\n \n\n   \n  But over the course of his working lunch with Trump, it became evident the Tomahawks would not soon be on their way to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Hopefully they won’t need it,” Trump said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”\n \n\n   \n  The conversation between the two leaders, alongside their top aides, continued behind closed doors on Friday afternoon in what was described to CNN by several people familiar as a tense, frank and, at times, “uncomfortable” discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made clear to Zelensky in a “direct and honest” conversation that — for now — the Ukrainian leader would not receive the long-range missiles. One official said Trump was under the impression that Ukraine is seeking to escalate and prolong the conflict and is worried about potential losses during an upcoming harsh winter.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said afterward he’d agreed with Trump not to discuss the Tomahawks in public. And Trump, as he was flying to Palm Beach for the weekend, wrote on social media that Russia and Ukraine should end the war “where they are,” tacking back to his position from the summer that land concessions were necessary after claiming in September that Ukraine might be able to regain its lost territories.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told those around him that was due to the “realities of where the conflict stands,” arguing there was too much devastation and too much killing, according to one official.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latest example of Trump inching closer to allowing new capabilities or applying new sanctions on Moscow, only to back away when Putin intervenes to head it off. In this case, it was a phone call initiated by the Kremlin a day before Zelensky arrived, meant ostensibly to congratulate Trump on his Middle East victory but which resulted in arranging another in-person meeting.\n \n\n   \n    Meetings with Putin and Xi on horizon\n \n\n   \n  If the Budapest summit materializes — Trump said he hoped it would happen in the next two weeks — it would mean back-to-back meetings with two of his top global adversaries who have, in recent years, deepened their alliance. Trump’s face-to-face summit with Xi, scheduled for the end of the month in South Korea, is intended to clarify trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  The war in Ukraine, which Beijing has helped sustain through military supplies and purchases of Russian oil, could be another point of contention. But Trump appeared confident he’d have the whole thing resolved before they sit down.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll be discussing that, but I’d love to see it ended before that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s assessments Friday that Putin “wants to end the war” were reminiscent of his confidence ahead of his August meeting with the Russian leader in Alaska, when he seemed sure the talks would result in quick progress toward a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  They did not, and before Thursday there seemed to be little evidence that Putin was interested in moving ahead with US-brokered negotiations. Trump said he believed threat of Tomahawks could have helped bring him back to the table.\n \n\n   \n  So, too, do American officials believe that a successful negotiation in the Middle East has led Russia to rethink how it is approaching Trump and his desire to see the Ukraine war ended.\n \n\n   \n  But even Trump seemed to allow for the possibility that he could be wrong, and that Putin — as he’s feared in the past — may just be stringing him along.\n \n\n   \n  “I am,” he said when asked whether he’s concerned Putin might be playing for time. “But, you know, I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/us-navy-detaining-survivors-strike-drug-boat","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"18:41:00-04:00","title":"US Navy Detains Two Survivors of Strike Against Alleged Drug Boat","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military, under President Donald Trump, carried out a strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, resulting in the detention of two survivors — a first in the administration’s campaign against drug traffickers.

survivors of strike against alleged drug boat \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, Katie Bo Lillis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:41 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military is holding two survivors on a Navy ship after the US carried out a Thursday strike on  an alleged drug boat  in the Caribbean, according to three US officials.\n \n\n   \n  The strike, which President Donald Trump confirmed Friday, was the sixth known strike on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. But it appeared to mark the first time an attack had not killed everyone on board.\n \n\n   \n  The detention marks the first time that the Trump administration’s military campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners, and it sets up a complicated legal and policy situation for the administration. It is unclear what the US is going to do with the survivors being held, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as it continues to promise further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about what happened to the survivors of the strike during an event at the White House Friday, Trump did not address the status of the detainees but said that US forces had “attacked a submarine, and that was a drug carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “Just so you understand this was not an innocent group of people,” he said. “I don’t know too many people that have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug carrying loaded up submarine.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who confirmed earlier in the week that he’d  authorized the CIA to conduct covert action  in Venezuela, also had harsh language for Maduro on Friday: “He doesn’t want to fuck around with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  The threat came when Trump was asked about reports that Maduro offered preferential access to the nation’s natural resources in exchange for lowering the temperature after the US conducted the series of Caribbean strikes.\n \n\n   \n  US Southern Command, which is responsible for military operations in the region, referred CNN to the White House for comment when asked about Thursday’s strike and the survivors.\n \n\n   \n    Legality of strikes in question\n \n\n   \n  The legality of the Trump administration’s operations in the Caribbean has been widely questioned. Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been both a driver and an architect of the policy – has argued that the US has the right to “wage war” against narco-terrorists. Earlier in the year, the administration designated multiple drug cartels and gangs operating in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The detaining of the alleged drug traffickers who were not killed in the strike this week sets up another legal dilemma for the administration. It’s unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the men, said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The Bush administration advanced the theory that it could rely solely on Article II for its military detention authorities, Finucane said — but the Supreme Court never ruled on the matter, leaving the question of its lawfulness unresolved. The Bush administration was ultimately able to rely on a 2001 congressional authorization that deemed the United States to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates to hold military detainees.\n \n\n   \n  The men held by the US Navy could hypothetically petition the courts to rule on the legality of their detention in what’s known as a habeas corpus claim, Finucane noted — a pathway followed by a number of detainees in the past that could reveal more information about the Trump administration’s secretive legal rationale for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/acosta-interview-epstein-house-oversight","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-10:17","title":"Trump’s Former Labor Secretary Alex Acosta Defends Handling of Controversial Epstein Plea Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney and Labor Secretary under Donald Trump, defended the 2008 non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein in a closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee, arguing that a federal trial would have been 'a crapshoot' due to weak evidence, victim testimony inconsistencies, and jurisdictional issues.

deal \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:34 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The former US attorney who negotiated a controversial 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein defended that agreement in a closed-door interview with House investigators last month, according to a transcript of the interview released by lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Alex Acosta, the former US attorney from the Southern District of Florida who later served as labor secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, disagreed with the assessment that he gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” and argued that it would have been a “crapshoot” to take the case to federal trial at the time.\n \n\n   \n  In an extensive interview with the House Oversight Committee, Acosta reflected on what he viewed as his constraints as the US attorney on the case and why he felt he did the best he could with the circumstances he was navigating.\n \n\n   \n  The interview was part of the committee’s bipartisan investigation into Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, which has included subpoenas for documents and closed-door testimony. The congressional investigation comes amid growing calls for more transparency over the case.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta  resigned  from the post of Secretary of Labor in 2019 after he faced furor over the plea deal. Epstein avoided a federal trial at the time and  served only 13 months in prison for state prostitution charges over his involvement with underage girls .  A Miami Herald investigation published  in 2018 described the plea deal, negotiated by Acosta, as the “deal of a lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  In his testimony to Congress, Acosta said that a Washington-based attorney from the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section who reviewed the case said going to trial would be a “crapshoot” – a judgement he apparently agreed with.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the trial was a crapshoot, and we just wanted the guy to go to jail,” Acosta told the House Oversight panel.\n \n\n   \n  “If we go to trial and we roll the dice and we do the crapshoot and we lose, what kind of signal does that send? That says that he got away with it, that you can do that more. And so we thought it was very, very important  to send that signal, and that’s why – that’s one reason we favored the negotiated plea,” he later added.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta laid out why he thought the victims’ statements and issues of jurisdiction would have posed challenges to the case if it had gone to trial in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “Every attorney that looked at the case, from the prosecuting attorney, again, through the entire chain, looked at the evidence, and there were evidentiary issues with the victims,” Acosta stated. “Many victims refused to testify. Many victims had changing stories. All of us understood why they had changing stories, but they did. And defense counsel would have – cross-examination would have been withering.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said investigators did not have evidence that Epstein traveled with any victims across state lines, which would have supported a federal charge, or that there were other individuals involved.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, one of the major questions in the case was, is this a Federal case or is it a local case?” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  While Acosta acknowledged that in the political climate today, “there’s a greater desire for ‘just go for it’” among the public,” he claimed that was not the case in the early 2000s when he was making the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Myself, the prosecuting attorney, the managing attorney of the Palm Beach office, the Criminal chief, and the first assistant all favored a pre-trial resolution. It was across-the-board,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta has previously defended his handling of the plea deal, but the release of the closed-door interview transcript offers extensive insight into the former US attorney’s decision-making in the highly scrutinized, and criticized, case.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Acosta stood firm behind his actions, he acknowledged that others have had strong criticisms of his work.\n \n\n   \n  “Looking back in hindsight, there are a number of issues that I will, you know, that I will say caused the community and the victims to feel – to feel that this was not a good resolution, and I get that,” Acosta said. “But from the perspective of our prosecutors at the time, based on the evidence we had at the time, you know, everyone in our office wanted to put him in jail, and that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta placed blame on his state counterparts for allowing Epstein to participate in a work release program that enabled him to be outside of the jail during the business day.\n \n\n   \n  “The work release was granted by the Palm Beach sheriff. Our office opposed it. Our office had every expectation that he would have continuous confinement. We were upset – more than upset. We were – what’s the polite word for ticked off? I’ll say ticked off. We were ticked off that he didn’t do so,” Acosta testified.\n \n\n   \n  “When we found out about it we objected. We objected in writing. We objected fully,” Acosta detailed.\n \n\n   \n    Acosta says it was ‘entirely’ his choice to resign as labor secretary amid Epstein furor\n \n\n   \n  Acosta repeatedly said he did not know if Trump was interviewed as part of his case and said the decision of who was interviewed was not up to him.\n \n\n   \n  “Not to my knowledge,” Acosta said when pressed by investigators. “It would not have been my practice to get involved in who was and who wasn’t interviewed.” He added he had no recollection of ever seeing documents where Trump’s name surfaced during the investigation into Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta said he never spoke to Trump until he was under consideration to be his Labor Secretary. Acosta said there were only two times the Epstein matter could have come up in discussion with Trump or anyone in his administration, but was not certain or specific on the details.\n \n\n   \n  The first was during his vetting process.\n \n\n   \n  “I may have had a communication – I don’t recall if I did or if it was simply – or if there was some written question or otherwise. But at some point in the vetting process, a question may have arisen,” Acosta said. “I honestly don’t remember.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said he had a conversation with Trump’s then- communications team, but did not give an exact date and was vague on specifics. I know in The Washington Post there was a story above the fold at one point,” he said, “And so I talked to the communications team, because the communications team needed to be briefed.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta was also asked about rumors that Epstein had ties to the intelligence community., He said during the investigation no one from the intelligence community reached out to the office about Epstein and that he had no reason to believe Epstein was an asset to a foreign or domestic intelligence agency. “If there was any secure information, procedures would have been triggered that were never triggered,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  On his eventual decision to resign in 2019, Acosta said, “I was neither instructed to resign, it wasn’t suggested that I resign. It was entirely my choice, my decision.”\n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Acosta was shown at least two news articles that connected Trump to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  One was a New York Magazine  article  from 2002 prior to Acosta’s term as US attorney, where Trump is quoted saying he knows Epstein for 15 years and calls him a “terrific guy.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a lot of fun to be with.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hubris courses through what President Donald Trump and his administration are doing right now. So much of it is unpopular and politically fraught. They’re charging ahead regardless.\n \n\n   \n  That’s true of the tariffs. It’s true of the growing militarization of the homeland. And it’s been true of his cuts to the government and  many other things .\n \n\n   \n  But perhaps nothing is as politically fraught right now as what’s happening off the coast of South America.\n \n\n   \n  There are growing signs that Trump is  flirting with regime change or even attacking Venezuela . And to the extent it’s more than a bluff, it’s not difficult to see the situation blowing up in the administration’s face.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf today runs through the increased saber-rattling and  signs of a building clash . The US Navy has built up in the Caribbean, and the Air Force flew B-52 bombers off the Venezuelan coast for hours on Wednesday. The Trump administration is striking alleged drug boats  in quite possibly illegal ways . Trump has both left open the possibility of strikes inside Venezuela and confirmed Wednesday that he has  authorized covert CIA action there .\n \n\n   \n  We also learned Thursday that the admiral overseeing this US Southern Command region, Adm. Alvin Holsey, has  suddenly announced his retirement . CNN reports this came amid tensions over the administration’s activities, though the Pentagon denied this.\n \n\n   \n  There are a couple ways to read all this.\n \n\n   \n  One is that this is part of a trademark Trump pressure campaign to get Venezuela to bend to his will. Perhaps the threat will be enough to get Trump what he wants.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a different side of Trump in his second term –  an increasingly militaristic one . He seems to have shed the non-interventionist political veneer that characterized his campaigns for office in favor of a more heavy-handed approach on the world stage. And that would fit with his broader project, which appears to be largely about showing how powerful he can be.\n \n\n   \n  And even if his saber-rattling is all intended as a bluff, at some point it’s conceivable that the president could be forced to follow through.\n \n\n   \n  If it comes to that, it’s difficult to see how Trump would have the American people behind him.\n \n\n   \n  While we don’t have good quality polling on the Venezuela situation specifically, other recent surveys have shown Americans taking a dim view of such foreign adventurism.\n \n\n   \n  A  poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  last year showed the percentage of Americans who favored an active role in world affairs hitting its lowest point since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Just 17% of Americans agreed that the US had a “responsibility” to take a leading role in world affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  in June showed Americans agreed 58%-38% that it’s better if the US “stays out of the affairs of other nations.” Majorities of Republicans, independents and Democrats agreed with that sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  Americans have been willing to take active roles in certain foreign conflicts. But that quickly changes when it includes the prospect of conflict involving US troops and regime change, according to several surveys taken around the time of US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Iran is, of course, not Venezuela. You could certainly argue that going to war with Iran would be a far riskier proposition.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s a threat that Americans have been quite concerned about for years and decades. But there is no evidence that Americans feel similarly about Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made the case that Venezuela has sent drugs and gangs to invade the United States, but so many of these claims have proven hyperbolic – and  even been rejected by judges  and  his own intelligence community .\n \n\n   \n  It’s conceivable that Americans could be convinced that going into Venezuela is necessary to combat the flow of drugs. A 2023  Reuters poll , for instance, showed Americans supported sending the US military to Mexico to “fight against drug cartels and try to reduce the flow of illegal narcotics,” 52%-36%.\n \n\n   \n  But even that poll showed how wary Americans are of a wider war. When asked whether the US should do this unilaterally – in other words without the permission of the Mexican government – support plummeted. Americans opposed that about 2-to-1 – 59%-29%.\n \n\n   \n  That’s essentially the proposition in Venezuela, with a little potential regime change sprinkled on top.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump really goes there, it will show he’s truly thrown political caution to the wind.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/supreme-court-national-guard-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00-04:00","title":"Trump asks Supreme Court to OK National Guard deployment in Chicago","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court requesting authorization to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, asserting that federal personnel face a violent, pre-planned ambush and that the president’s authority to declare a national emergency is not subject to judicial review.

On Thursday, the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals let stand an order temporarily blocking that effort.\n \n\n   \n  Trump filed the appeal at the Supreme Court in a case involving his effort to deploy the guard to Chicago. In the appeal, the administration said that lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The litigation puts the controversy before a Supreme Court that has rarely ruled on such deployments – but that has often deferred to the president on matters of security and defining what  constitutes a national emergency . The administration asked for a quick order that would allow them to carry out the deployment while the high court considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  In the appeal, the Trump administration argues lower courts were impermissibly encroaching on the president’s authority to control federalized guard members.\n \n\n   \n  The   lower court order temporarily blocking the deployment, the administration said, put the judicial branch “in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the president’s commander-in-chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the president can deploy.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting that federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  “Federal agents are forced to desperately scramble to protect themselves and federal property, allocating resources away from their law-enforcement mission to conduct protective operations instead,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court.\n \n\n   \n  That framing starts in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as a “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court balked at Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In the administration’s appeal on Friday, Sauer said that case “squarely controls” Trump’s current deployments.\n \n\n   \n   Based on that, the Trump administration has argued, federal courts may not even review a president’s decisions to call up the guard.\n \n\n   \n  But the states challenging those decisions have scoffed at the notion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army. And they have pointed to a 1932 decision, Sterling v. Constantin, in which courts reviewed a former Texas governor’s decision to deploy the National Guard to shut down certain oil fields in the state in order to limit production. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that courts could review such deployment decisions that fell beyond a “range of honest judgment.”\n \n\n   \n  Just how fast the Supreme Court will move in the case was not immediately clear, but the court requested a response from state and local officials by Monday evening – a faster than usual turnaround.\n \n\n   \n  The 6-3 conservative court has sided with Trump in the vast majority of emergency cases he has filed since returning to power in January.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/media/smartmatic-doj-fox-giuliani-bribery-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Smartmatic Indicted in Foreign Bribery Case, Possibly Endangering Its Lawsuits Against Fox News and Giuliani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Smartmatic, a global voting technology company, is facing foreign bribery charges from the U.S. Department of Justice over alleged $1 million payments to a top Philippine election official in 2016 to secure election contracts.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department on Thursday filed foreign bribery charges against Smartmatic, the voting technology company that is suing Fox News and other prominent pro-Trump figures for defamation over their promotion of 2020 election lies.\n \n\n   \n  The bribery and money laundering charges against Smartmatic arose from  an existing case  filed last year against some of its current and former executives, including its founder.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment relates to an alleged $1 million bribe paid to the top election official in the Philippines to secure lucrative contracts for that country’s 2016 elections. The indictment doesn’t include any allegations of voter fraud or election-rigging against Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  The news could be catastrophic for Smartmatic, potentially weakening its hand in pending 2020 election-related defamation lawsuits against Fox News, the Fox News host turned US attorney  Jeanine Pirro , ex-Trump lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  and MyPillow CEO  Mike Lindell .\n \n\n   \n  The charges could undermine Smartmatic’s arguments that its reputation has been damaged solely by these pro-Trump figures and their brazen lies about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “This is more of the same. A photocopy of the previous spurious indictment,” Smartmatic said in a statement on Thursday, denying wrongdoing and vowing to fight the case.\n \n\n   \n  The company further said, “We believe the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida has been misled and politically influenced by powerful interests, despite our extensive cooperation with the government. This is again, targeted, political, and unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what meddling Smartmatic is referring to. President Donald Trump has successfully pushed in recent weeks to  prosecute his opponents , but the underlying case against Smartmatic executives was brought by the Biden-era Justice Department, and career prosecutors endorsed Thursday’s new indictment, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic’s co-defendants previously pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s machines and software are widely used overseas, but in US elections, they are only used in Los Angeles. Dean Logan, the top election official for Los Angeles County, told CNN in a statement that the county owns and controls its own voting systems, but will “hold Smartmatic accountable to the terms and protections” of their ongoing contract.\n \n\n   \n  “The indictment is unrelated to the County’s administration of elections or the integrity of Los Angeles County’s voting systems, and the County’s contracts with Smartmatic were validated to ensure that all work was performed and requirements met,” Logan said. “Further, the County’s engagements with Smartmatic are fixed fee contracts with specific protection from the types of add-on fees and price inflation alleged in the activities cited in the indictment.”\n \n\n   \n    The defamation cases\n \n\n   \n  After President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he and his allies  spread the false claim  that Smartmatic technology flipped millions of votes to rob him of a victory.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic filed defamation lawsuits in 2021 against these figures, and other right-wing media outlets, seeking billions of dollars in damages. The company  settled with Newsmax  last year for $40 million and  settled with One America News  for an undisclosed amount.\n \n\n   \n  All of these pro-Trump outlets and figures deny wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines scandal — which  CNN first revealed  in 2023 — has  provided a major boost  to these pro-Trump figures facing defamation lawsuits. They have sought additional documents about the criminal probe, hoping these will weaken damages claims from Smartmatic, and they’ve argued that the indictment proves Smartmatic’s shady practices.\n \n\n   \n  “Smartmatic was and is a failing company: its continued cozy relationship with dictators, a decade of mismanagement and poor performance, and criminal bribery charges against its highest echelon of leaders,” Fox News wrote in a court filing earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Kate Mangels, a Los Angeles-based defense attorney who has handled defamation cases, said the indictment “severely limits” Smartmatic’s ability to claim it’s still suffering from ongoing damages from the 2020-era lies about its supposed vote-rigging.\n \n\n   \n  “The defendants in the defamation lawsuits will likely argue that, to the extent Smartmatic’s reputation has been harmed, it is impossible to tease out what harm came from the alleged defamation and what harm came from the indictment,” Mangels said.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment could also influence settlement negotiations, Mangels said, because “at trial, it would be difficult for Smartmatic to establish that all the damages” stem from the allegedly defamatory broadcasts and statements.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/deadly-michigan-plane-crash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00Z","title":"Deadly plane crash in Michigan mirrors similar business jet crash last year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A private Mexican-registered Hawker 800XP business jet crashed during a post-maintenance test flight near Lansing, Michigan, killing all three on board — two pilots and a maintenance representative.

captures pilots in an apparent struggle to regain control of a private business jet as the plane plunged into woods near Lansing, Michigan on Thursday, killing all three on board.\n \n\n   \n  “Stall recovery, stall recovery,” one of the pilots of the Mexican-registered Hawker 800XP can be heard transmitting to air traffic control in a recording by LiveATC.net.\n \n\n   \n  The controller from the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center then tried to reach the pilots seven times with no response.\n \n\n   \n  Bystanders captured video showing the jet corkscrewing toward the ground, then disappearing behind homes before a large black plume of smoke appears.\n \n\n   \n  The National Transportation Safety Board announced Friday it has opened an investigation into the crash.\n \n\n   \n  The crash happened during a test flight at the end of scheduled maintenance performed by Duncan Aviation, according to a statement from the company.\n \n\n   \n  Two pilots working for the jet owner and their maintenance representative were killed in the crash.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, our focus is on supporting the families and friends of the crew, our team members who worked on the aircraft and

Oz cautions it’s not a done deal, but patients and doctors say it could be a gamechanger \n       \n  By Meg Tirrell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Janet McCaskill was on vacation in Arizona with her husband and best friend when she heard that President Donald Trump had suggested he might be able to bring the cost of popular weight-loss drugs down to $150 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “The thought of it going to $150 a month is dramatic,” said McCaskill, a grandmother from North Carolina  who’s lost 100 pounds  with the help of GLP-1 medicines, a class best known for the diabetes drug Ozempic. “That is most fantastic – if it comes to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump planted the idea Thursday in an Oval Office news conference about an entirely different set of drugs – those for  in vitro fertilization  – before his Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator, Dr. Mehmet Oz, stepped in to warn it wasn’t a done deal.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump’s comments made waves. Patients who’ve struggled to afford the pricey medicines shared hope the price could be reached. Doctors called it “huge for patients,” if true. And in a sign that Wall Street took it seriously, stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of GLP-1 drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, fell significantly, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in the companies’ market values.\n \n\n   \n  It’s just not clear it’ll actually happen.\n \n\n   \n    An awkward moment in the Oval\n \n\n   \n  It started with a familiar refrain from the president,  who’s previously lamented  the cost difference of weight-loss drugs in Europe compared with the US.\n \n\n   \n  “In London, you’d buy a certain drug for $130 … and in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing,” Trump said in opening remarks of his IVF announcement Thursday. “So now we’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150.”\n \n\n   \n  A reporter, Max Bayer of Endpoints News, made the connection, asking later if Trump was referring to bringing weight-loss drugs down to $150. The president confirmed he was “referring to Ozempic, or the fat-loss drug … they’ll be much lower.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, Dr. Oz started to look uncomfortable, stepping up to the podium with a subtle shaking of his head.\n \n\n   \n  “We have not negotiated those yet,” Oz clarified. “We’re going to be rolling these out over time.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t take long for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly’s stocks to react, each dropping about 4% in after hours trading Thursday and maintaining losses through trading on Friday. A Wall Street analyst, Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets, sought to assuage investor fears of coming price cuts in a research note Thursday evening that called Trump’s remarks “aggressive posturing amidst negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  The drug companies were tight-lipped. Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and its weight-loss counterpart, Wegovy, told CNN that the company “has engaged in discussions” with the Trump administration about drug pricing in the context of the president’s Most Favored Nation executive order, an approach that dictates the US shouldn’t pay more for medicines than the lowest price offered to peer nations.\n \n\n   \n  Medicines are routinely sold at markedly higher prices in the US than other countries, including diabetes and weight-loss drugs: Ozempic is priced 10 times higher in the US than France, according to  a 2023 analysis  from Peterson-KFF.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain focused on improving patient access and affordability, and we will continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need,” a Novo Nordisk spokeswoman said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, said the company is “not aware of any specific price commitments,” and that it’s “in discussions with the administration to further expand patient access, preserve innovation and promote affordability for our medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Most Favored Nation’ drug prices\n \n\n   \n  The president has announced deals with  Pfizer ,  AstraZeneca  and  EMD Serono  in the past month under the Most Favored Nation framework, and has promised more to come. The deals so far have included an offering of medicines at Most Favored Nation prices to Medicaid – a system that already receives heavy discounts – as well as deals on certain drugs that can be purchased directly by consumers, without insurance, through a new platform called TrumpRx.\n \n\n   \n  In return, drugmakers have won reprieves from the threat of tariffs, as long as they continue to invest in manufacturing and research in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Thus far, the deals have appeared neutral or positive to pharmaceutical companies, with  Pfizer’s stock rising  the day of its announcement and buoying competitors along with it. The agreements, Seigerman wrote, “have been far from a sweeping implementation of US pricing cuts.”\n \n\n   \n  The drugs Pfizer and the White House noted  would be offered  through the TrumpRx program don’t appear to be used very often in the US, face generic competition in the near future, or carry such high list prices that even steep discounts for cash-paying patients would leave the medicines unaffordable for most people, said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 medications, though, so-called for a hormone they mimic, are used by millions of Americans, and “if you look at the barriers to using them, cost is the number one thing,” said  Dr. Louis Aronne , director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n \n\n   \n    From thousands to hundreds\n \n\n   \n  The medicines are all priced, before insurance or discounts, at about $1,000 a month or more in the US. With commercial insurance coverage, many patients pay as little as $25 out of pocket. But coverage can be thorny, especially for weight loss, and some insurers are  reducing coverage .\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill experienced that firsthand. She started using Mounjaro in late 2022 to try to lose weight, and had such strong results, she credits the medicine with saving her life. But her insurance didn’t cover it, and it was so expensive she switched to a compounded version made by a local pharmacy.\n \n\n   \n  Compounders typically make drugs that require personalization, like if a patient is allergic to a certain ingredient or needs other modifications made. But law also allows compounding when medicines are in shortage, and GLP-1 manufacturers had trouble meeting outsized demand for several years, opening up an entire market of off-brand, compounded GLP-1s.\n \n\n   \n  Though the shortages  have now ended , some purveyors still offer compounded versions of the medicines, at much lower prices than Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly – even after  the companies introduced  cash pay discounted options.\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill said she switched to a Lilly program that allowed her to buy its weight-loss drug, Zepbound,  directly at at discount  after her local compounding pharmacy stopped selling the medication. But it costs her about $500 a month. Her best friend, Kay Powell, a nurse, is also on one of the medicines, but gets a compounded version through another pharmacy she trusts for $150.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m moving back to the compound just as soon as I can get to my doctor next week,” McCaskill told CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re price shopping,” Powell added. “We’re going to buy it wherever it’s most affordable.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big however’\n \n\n   \n  The White House and US Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from CNN about Trump’s $150 promise from the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  And doctors, analysts and policy researchers were skeptical they’d reach a $150 deal – or even what that might mean.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments may be “more to get these guys to make a deal than to actually get the price to $150 over the short term,” said Jared Holz, a health care strategist for financial firm Mizuho Securities USA. “Everything that comes out of this administration seems like it’s a precursor to some sort of transaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. William Feldman, a physician and health policy researcher at UCLA, pointed out Novo Nordisk is  also in negotiations  with Oz’s CMS over pricing of semaglutide – the generic name of Ozempic and Wegovy – for Medicare, under a framework laid out in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. He noted it’s not clear if a $150 monthly price would be part of those negotiations or a broader agreement outside them.\n \n\n   \n  “$150 a month gets closer to prices for semaglutide in other parts of the world and even to prices for compounded versions in the US,” he told CNN by email Friday. “This could be a boon for patients and could drive increased uptake in the US. However – and this is a big however – I’d like to see more details.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Jody Dushay, an attending physician in endocrinology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said she refers patients to both Lilly and Novo Nordisk for their self-pay options when they don’t have insurance coverage, but pointed out “for many patients $500 a month is still totally unaffordable.”\n \n\n   \n  She urges patients to steer clear of compounded products, though, “due to lack of regulation and unknown safety and efficacy.”\n \n\n   \n  If the branded versions were priced at $150 a month,  access “would greatly increase,” said Dr. Jorge Moreno, an obesity specialist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. “Even more patients would be willing and able to afford paying” for them.\n \n\n   \n  Even an out-of-pocket cost “would still pose some financial barriers,” said Dr. David Kim, an assistant professor of medicine and public health sciences at the University of Chicago. Vanderbilt’s Dusetzina pointed out “prior research has shown that once the prices reach $100 per month, many people do not fill their medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    260 pounds all together\n \n\n   \n  Affording GLP-1 medicines can make people feel desperate at their current prices and without insurance coverage, McCaskill said, especially as she’s seen not just dramatic weight loss but improvements in her cholesterol and other health markers.\n \n\n   \n  “Between the three of us, we’ve probably lost – what – 260 pounds?” Powell added, including McCaskill’s husband, Barry, in the tally.\n \n\n   \n  They all said they’d switch to the branded versions, away from the compounded ones, if they were offered at comparable prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the real thing,” Barry said. “No question.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story misspelled Bayer’s last name.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/des-moines-superintendent-ian-roberts-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"15:44:00-05:00","title":"Iowa Superintendent Detained by ICE Falsely Claimed He Was a US Citizen, Indictment Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ian Roberts, the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, was indicted by a federal grand jury for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship on an I-9 form and for unlawfully possessing firearms while illegally present in the United States.

— The former  superintendent of Iowa’s largest school district  has been indicted by a federal grand jury after authorities said he falsely claimed to be a US citizen who was eligible to work.\n \n\n   \n  A two-count indictment returned Thursday evening by a federal grand jury in Des Moines charges  Ian Roberts  with one count of making a false statement for employment and one count of being an

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a targeted operation.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said Roberts  fled from agents  in his district-issued Jeep Cherokee before being found in a wooded area.

Bolton \n       \n  By Jeremy Herb, Katelyn  Polantz, Kristen Holmes, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  By the time FBI Director Kash Patel took office in February, the investigation into whether John Bolton mishandled classified information had been in the works for roughly three years.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump had long been calling for Bolton – and other perceived political enemies – to be prosecuted, and the Maryland US Attorney’s office had been quietly building a case that started during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  When Patel was briefed on Bolton and other sensitive investigations shortly after landing at the bureau, he was surprised at the amount of evidence gathered.\n \n\n   \n  “Why isn’t this m*therf**ker ​ in jail yet?” Patel said after being briefed, sources familiar with the exchange told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security adviser in 2018 and 2019, is now the third Trump critic to be indicted in the past month after the president implored Attorney General Pam Bondi in a  social media post  he thought was a private message: “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility.”\n \n\n   \n  Within days of that message urging Bondi to act, Comey  was indicted on charges  of lying to Congress. Soon after, New York Attorney General Letitia James was charged with bank fraud related to a mortgage  in an indictment unveiled  last week. But while Trump called in his post specifically for the prosecutions of Comey, James and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, he never mentioned Bolton in his missive.\n \n\n   \n  The cases against Comey and James were presented to a grand jury by Lindsey Halligan, an interim US attorney handpicked by Trump for the position after the previous US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was forced out amid pressure to bring the cases.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer who had no previous prosecutorial experience, was the only prosecutor to sign both indictments.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, six prosecutors, including US Attorney for Maryland Kelly Hayes and the current head of counterintelligence investigations at the Justice Department, Scott Lara, signed the 26-page indictment against Bolton.\n \n\n   \n  In it, prosecutors accused Bolton of sharing “more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities” through his personal email account with two unauthorized individuals, who CNN has reported are his wife and daughter.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike prosecutions brought against Comey and James, the Bolton case has maintained the support of career prosecutors and investigators, people briefed on the matter said. That hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly attacking Bolton and possibly causing damage to the case, some Justice officials fear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has railed for years against Bolton over his 2020 memoir that was highly critical of the president, claiming he should have gone to jail because classified information was contained in the book. Trump’s first Justice Department opened criminal and civil investigations into the book in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he’s, you know, a bad person. I think he’s a bad guy,” Trump said Thursday when told Bolton had been indicted, adding that he had not reviewed the case.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton made his initial court appearance in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Friday morning, pleading not guilty to all 18 counts. He said in a statement Thursday that he was a victim of Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” Bolton said. “I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Good luck, Mr. Mustache!’\n \n\n   \n  In June 2021, the Justice Department  closed its year-old criminal investigation  that scrutinized whether Bolton’s 2020 book had illegally revealed national security information.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, an Iranian hack of Bolton’s AOL email account would set in motion a new probe that led to Thursday’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  On July 6, 2021, a Bolton representative notified the FBI that he was the victim of an email breach by suspected Iranian hackers.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have been laboring on this case since then after the FBI began assessing potential damage from the hack and raised questions about whether Bolton’s practice of sending diary entries from his personal email broke the law, according to people briefed on the probe.\n \n\n   \n  The Iranian hacking campaign targeting Bolton and other former government officials included threats against Bolton to expose him and cause him problems of the kind that crippled Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  “Good luck Mr. Mustache!” one message sent in August 2021 said, according to a person who described investigative documents.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI and national security lawyers in Maryland, and at Justice Department headquarters, formally opened an investigation into the hack in 2022, sources said. Early in the probe, prosecutors on the investigation got warrants to receive the data from service companies that hosted relevant accounts, such as Yahoo for Bolton’s AOL account and Google for another account, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The work building a case was slow and meticulous. Information returned to the prosecutors needed to be reviewed by both the intelligence community, which was sensitive to classified information, and processed through a filter team at the Justice Department that would pull out confidential attorney-client records, because Bolton was a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the work around what Bolton had and shared in his email account was an investigation essentially walled off from the one related to his book, which had been run by the US Attorney’s office in the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  By the time investigators were ready to obtain a search warrant in August, the book manuscript had once again become part of the case. It was part – along with the hack – of what prosecutors pointed to in court as a basis for searching his office and home, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to search Bolton’s office and especially his home were crucial in the final turn of the investigation before the indictment this week.\n \n\n   \n  While investigators spent months assembling an idea of the emails and classified records they would want to use to build the case, Bolton’s home contained printed copies of some of the emails, the indictment said. Investigators had long suspected they would find hard copies like those, sources told CNN, because some of the emails Bolton wrote to his family he noted were for “the Archives.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s really treasonous’\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly attacked Bolton since the release of his 2020 book and as Bolton has become one of the more prominent ex-Trump staffers turned critic of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton was named Trump’s third national security adviser in 2018, a position that marked the culmination of a lengthy career in Washington across multiple administrations, including as George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  The initial Justice Department criminal probe of Bolton began in 2020 with an investigation into whether his he violated the law by including information the administration said was classified in his memoir. The same year, the Trump administration sued in civil court to try to stop publication of Bolton’s book over a dispute of whether he got proper sign off from classification authorities.\n \n\n   \n   Bolton’s memoir  included shocking allegations about the inner workings of the Trump White House, including that Trump requested Chinese help to win the 2020 election, argued Venezuela was part of the US and offered to help Turkey’s leader avoid a Justice Department probe.\n \n\n   \n  Trump publicly called for Bolton to be prosecuted in 2020 over the book’s publication, saying in  an interview  that his former national security advisor released “massive amounts” of classified information in its pages.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really treasonous what he did,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  On X, then called  Twitter , Trump called Bolton “a lowlife who should be in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Trump hasn’t frequently commented this year on the Bolton probe – a stark contrast from his public pressure campaigns for the prosecutions of other political foes who were key figures in investigations into himself.\n \n\n   \n  But since the search of Bolton’s house and office in August, Trump has asked advisers about the status of the case. He had been assured in recent weeks that they were moving ahead and that it was a strong case, sources said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Stay tuned’\n \n\n   \n  In late August, when FBI agents executed a search warrants on Bolton’s home and office, they  seized electronics and multiple documents  labeled “secret,” “confidential,” and “classified,” including some about weapons of mass destruction, according to court records filed by prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi, Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino all posted statements on X the morning of the search,  breaking department norms  of not commenting on ongoing investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “Public corruption will not be tolerated,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino  wrote .\n \n\n   \n  After the search, Bolton’s attorney Abbe Lowell said that the records Bolton kept would have been typical of those kept by a long-time government official. In a statement Thursday, Lowell said that the records were unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, were known to the FBI and were “personal diaries.”\n \n\n   \n  The next month, senior Justice Department leaders, including an attorney from the deputy attorney general’s office, were  pressing for the US Attorney’s office  to charge Bolton in the days after Trump complained that prosecutions of his enemies weren’t moving quickly enough.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors in the Maryland US attorney’s office pushed back, arguing the timeline was too aggressive and they needed more time to bring a stronger case against Bolton, including reviewing the records obtained from the search warrant.\n \n\n   \n  One Justice Department official was considering pulling prosecutors off the case out of opposition to the deputy attorney general’s instruction.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, though, the political pressure eased on the Maryland office after Comey’s indictment. Career prosecutors on the case withdrew their reservations on timing and set in motion  finalizing the indictment  last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the lead prosecutor in Bolton’s case, Thomas Sullivan – who also worked on the Biden classified documents investigation under special counsel Robert Hur – presented to a federal grand jury for a little over two hours at the federal courthouse about 20 minutes outside DC.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen minutes after members of the grand jury filed out of the courthouse, Sullivan, four of his colleagues and the jury foreperson took an elevator one floor up to Magistrate Judge Gina Simms’ courtroom to deliver the indictments approved that day. After the foreperson handed up the indictments, the judge asked if there were any other matters she needed addressed, to which Sullivan said yes.\n \n\n   \n  He handed the judge a slim red file, but and said nothing else. Simms then quickly reviewed the file – also not saying aloud any details of it – before adjourning. The entire proceeding lasted less than 10 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the courtroom, Sullivan said few words to reporters seeking information about what he gave the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “I would just stay posted,” he said. “Stay tuned.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/no-kings-protests-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00Z","title":"Another nationwide day of protest is set for this weekend.

House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed, without evidence, that Saturday’s planned rallies have contributed to the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  When the first round of “No Kings” protests took place, Trump had just barreled through the first five months of his second term with  hundreds of executive orders  and other moves targeting birthright citizenship, protections for transgender people, student protesters, federal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and more.\n \n\n   \n  Tension over immigration raids reached a fever pitch with protests in Los Angeles, where Trump  federalized the California National Guard  against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom – a move that experts warned was an  unprecedented and dangerous escalation  of presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the administration has only “doubled down,” protest organizers say.\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents, under pressure to meet the administration’s  arrest quotas , have performed raids throughout the country, sometimes met with fervent protests by community members. Trump has called on the Justice Department to prosecute his political opponents, former FBI director  James Comey  and Attorney General of New York  Letitia James . The administration has challenged unflattering media coverage, resulting in a  defamation lawsuit  against The New York Times and the suspension (and eventual return) of “ Jimmy Kimmel Live! ”\n \n\n   \n  And the administration has escalated its  attempted deployment of federal troops  into Democratic-led cities, like DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.\n \n\n   \n  Local and state leaders have pushed back against the National Guard deployments, and legal battles are still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican politicians have branded the upcoming protests as “Hate America” rallies. GOP Sen. Roger Marshall alleged “professional protesters” and “agitators” will show up, and Johnson suggested participants would be “pro-Hamas” and “Antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  But organizers are planning for peaceful demonstrations aimed at providing a clear contrast to the administration’s recent show of force.\n \n\n   \n    Could the protests prompt more military force?\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll have to get the National Guard out,” Marshall recently said about Saturday’s protests. “Hopefully it’ll be peaceful. I doubt it.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the possibility of National Guard deployment to Saturday’s protests.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday directed the state’s National Guard to deploy troops to Austin ahead of a planned protest his office characterized as being “antifa-linked.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas Democrats were quick to condemn the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do — and Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them,” Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Indivisible Project, the nonprofit organizing the protest, has trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation, and organizers are working directly with cities that have   a National Guard presence to make sure they are prepared, its co-executive director, Leah Greenberg, said.\n \n\n   \n  In other areas, organizers have been working to educate protesters on their rights, in the event troops show up somewhere unexpected.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not expect there to be any need for the National Guard to be deployed, but if the Trump administration attempts to do that as a way to intimidate peaceful protests, we are prepared for that,” Deirdre Schifeling of the ACLU said Thursday at a meeting of protest organizers.\n \n\n   \n  “What we are expecting is millions of people around the country collectively showing up to oppose authoritarianism, corruption and attacks on our neighbors and our rights,” Greenberg told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has already planned another celebratory military show of force in California set to take place on the same day of the protests,  Newsom  noted Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers hope to build on the momentum of June’s protests and the  Hands Off!  and  50501  protests this spring. They’re confident the movement has grown steadily in response to the administration’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  For local leaders who have tried to push back against what they describe as federal overreach in their cities, Saturday may provide an opportunity to send a message.\n \n\n   \n  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is set to headline the No Kings event in her city this Saturday. Following recent protest activity in Boston,  Trump threatened to pull the FIFA World Cup  out of Massachusetts next year, a move Wu says Trump does not have the authority to make.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the protests could prompt the administration to send more military force into cities, said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n \n\n   \n  The memorandum Trump used to send the first round of federal troops into Los Angeles can be used to take similar action around the country, Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Under this memorandum, troops can be deployed if there are entirely peaceful protests,” she said, calling it “a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms.”\n \n\n   \n  And almost any violence on the part of individual protesters could end up bolstering the administration’s case for calling in troops, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “So might the administration use the protests this weekend as justification to deploy troops? It certainly looks that way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  As for whether people will see troops on the ground in new locations as protests play out Saturday, Goitein noted that it takes some planning to mobilize troops and direct them to a particular location.\n \n\n   \n  “It can’t be done at the snap of anyone’s fingers, so if we were to see the military deployed at these protests, that means it was in the works beforehand,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    DHS advises local agencies to mitigate potential for violence\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the “No Kings 2” protests, Department of Homeland Security officials are warning about the potential for certain events to become violent.\n \n\n   \n  In a DHS intelligence report sent to law enforcement agencies around the nation Thursday, and obtained by CNN, DHS said it is “concerned” about the potential for violence at the demonstrations, “based on several events in the United States in 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  “Throughout these events, we observed behavioral indicators associated with violence and geopolitical developments that have historically driven violence at similar events,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence brief was meant to make law enforcement aware of indicators of possible violence at protests and ways to mitigate them in advance. It did not indicate that US national security officials were aware of any specific and credible threats, nor did it identify any planned protests by name.\n \n\n   \n  Particularly concerning behavior police should be on the lookout for includes the attendance of demonstrators “with a history of exploiting lawful protests to engage in violence” and demonstrators who have engaged in paramilitary-like training, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  Other potentially concerning behaviors included “protesters or counter-protesters engaging in harassing or intimidating behavior, which may escalate to physical violence,” and any indicators individuals may seek to distract and divert police away from an area where criminal activity is planned, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  In order to prevent and counter any possible violence, the intelligence report said law enforcement should communicate with mass transit agencies for awareness of increased travel to a particular area by people from outside the area, and consider limiting protests and counter protests to specific areas.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said law enforcement agencies should also proactively “establish liaisons with the protest organizers and counter-protest groups” and “clearly communicate legal parameters and guidelines to protest and counter-protest organizers so all parties understand the legal limits of activity before enforcement action is taken.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big tent’ protest effort\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown continues to threaten federal workers’ jobs and seeps into daily life, some Republican lawmakers have suggested that the protests are a distraction compounding the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Asked when the shutdown will end, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week, “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting ‘til this crazy No Kings rally this weekend … No Kings equal no paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg called the criticism “transparently ridiculous,” saying the protests were planned in September, before the government shutdown, and are “a big tent effort” encompassing a range of political identities and viewpoints.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg also pushed back against the idea that the protests are anti-American.\n \n\n   \n  “No Kings is about as American a value as you can imagine. It is as American as apple pie,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My husband and I were at the flagship event in Philly in June – the birthplace of the nation, which is why we chose it, and we led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg co-founded the progressive grassroots network Indivisible with her husband Ezra Levin in 2016 in response to Trump’s first election. It’s grown to include thousands of local Indivisible groups, which function autonomously but coordinate with national staff.\n \n\n   \n  The  network encompasses  the nonprofits Indivisible Project and Indivisible Civics, which organize protests and trainings, and Indivisible Action, a separate political action committee aiming to elect progressive candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg said she’s aware that organizations like Indivisible that have taken a public stance against Trump may be targeted by the administration.\n \n\n   \n  After conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s death,  Indivisible joined more than 500 nonprofits  in an open letter condemning what the groups described as the use of government power to target liberal organizations and threaten First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has recently taken aim at billionaire investor  George Soros  for funding “violent protests,” calling for racketeering charges against the philanthropist, and the White House has called Indivisible a “left-wing activist group” that has “received more than $7.6 million” from Soros.\n \n\n   \n  Soros’ long-running nonprofit,  Open Society Foundations , has provided millions in funding to Indivisible over the years, along with a vast number of predominantly left-leaning causes. Indivisible Project received almost  $8 million in contributions  from various sources in fiscal year 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re heartily aware that there are ongoing efforts to kill organized opposition – to retaliate, to come after people who stand against Trump and his agenda,” Greenberg said. “We’re aware of those things, and also we believe that we have one path forward, which is to continue to exercise our constitutional rights.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/unidentified-palestinian-bodies-handed-over-by-israel-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"15:36:00Z","title":"Uncertainty Surrounds Identities of More Than 100 Palestinian Bodies Handed Over by Israel","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has transferred over 120 Palestinian bodies to Gaza under a ceasefire agreement with Hamas, with no official identification or details about their deaths.

than 100 Palestinian bodies handed over by Israel \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Abeer Salman, Mohammed al Sawalhi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:26 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Palestinian forensic experts are working to identify 120 bodies returned to Gaza by Israel marked only with numbers, some of whom were blindfolded, bound at the hands and feet, or bearing gunshot wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Under the  ceasefire agreement  reached with Hamas last week, Israel agreed to transfer the bodies of what it called 360 “Gazan terrorists” into the enclave. Israel hasn’t provided any information about their identities or how they died.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether the 120 individuals whose remains were returned this week died in Israel’s custody, in Gaza during the war, or were killed in Israel as they took part in the October 7, 2023, terror attack.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, health ministry, foreign ministry, justice ministry and the Israel Prison Service for comment, but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  Only a handful of the 120 bodies have been identified so far. Two were named publicly by family members on social media as having participated in the assault on Israel on October 7, when thousands of Palestinians breached the perimeter fence.\n \n\n   \n  Many were militants who went on to kill 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others, mostly civilians, in communities across southern Israel. Others were ordinary Gazans who crossed into Israel but didn’t participate in the attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The unidentified remains were handed over by Israel to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which then delivered them to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Gaza, where forensic experts began examining them.\n \n\n   \n  An official from the Ministry of Health in Gaza told CNN each of the bodies had a document that indicated they were, at some point, held at Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert, and that DNA tests had been performed on them there.\n \n\n   \n  The base has been used by Israel as a detention center, where a number of  cases of abuse of Palestinian detainees  had been reported during the war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After the October 7 attacks, Israeli first responders were overwhelmed by the number of bodies found across multiple attack sites.\n \n\n   \n  At that time, members of the ZAKA, an Israeli volunteer search and rescue organization that was  called in to recover the bodies  near the Israel-Gaza perimeter, told CNN that the victims were taken to the Shura Army Base, while remains of the attackers were stored at a different base in the Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at the forensic department at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital described to CNN the state they found the bodies that were handed over this week, saying they showed “signs of abuse and torture.”\n \n\n   \n  “Each martyr is given a number, and all martyrs are bound at the hands and feet. Some are blindfolded, and there are signs of gunshot wounds,” the doctors said.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official said the bodies had broken bones and looked like they had been “crushed by heavy vehicles.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has seen photographs, including closeup shots, of some of the bodies. Zip ties, blindfolds, and gunshot wounds are clearly visible on some of them. Most of the bodies appear to belong to young men, and those who are clothed appear to be wearing civilian clothes. Some of the bodies had dirt on them. One with what appeared to be an IV cannula still in the arm.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official told CNN that some of the remains appeared to have been exhumed after burial.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Lawrence Owens, an independent forensic pathologist who looked at photographs of one of the bodies said the person in the picture was almost certainly bound and blindfolded before death, and noted that a fingertip appeared to be missing.\n \n\n   \n  Owens, a research fellow at the University of Winchester, said while the body had lines imprinted on it that appeared to be track marks, it was not nearly as damaged as one would expect if a heavy vehicle had rolled over it. He said, however, that it was possible the body was buried when run over.\n \n\n   \n  Another expert who examined the same photographs also said the deceased individual was bound and that the blindfold was likely applied before death, while the track marks appeared to have been caused after death.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Health has set up a website where it has posted images of the remains in the hopes that family members or friends might be able to identify them. Many of the photographs are extremely graphic, showing wounds and details of partially decomposed bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the remains have already been identified through the website, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n    Mother ‘searched through more than 30 bodies’\n \n\n   \n  Rasmiya Mohammed Khairi Qdeih from the town of Khuza’a in southern Gaza is among those searching for information about her family.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis on Wednesday, she said six of her sons were killed during the war, one has been taken prisoner by Israel, and one has been missing since the day Hamas and its allies in Gaza launched their assault in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Qdeih said she didn’t know whether the son missing from October 7 was dead or alive. She said he did not participate in the attack but went to Israel when the fence was breached to see what was happening.\n \n\n   \n  “I heard news that they had brought the bodies of prisoners, so I ran (to the hospital) to see if he was among them or not,” she told CNN. “Whenever they bring the bodies of prisoners, I come here and search among them. Yesterday, I searched through more than 30 bodies.”\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Center for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons (PCMFD) said in a statement on Tuesday that Israel’s omission of an official list of names of the deceased “arouses suspicion and strengthens doubts about practices of enforced disappearance and tampering with victims’ files.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stress the necessity of providing complete information about the bodies being handed over and publishing all available information as soon as it arrives, including the names of the victims and details about the circumstances of their deaths, and immediately notifying the families in respect for their right to know and human dignity,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many more bodies of Palestinians Israel is holding. An Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN last month that the bodies of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was believed to be one of the architects of the October 7 attack, and his brother Mohammed, would not be returned to Gaza.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/climate/imo-shipping-carbon-tax-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:14:00-04:00","title":"US helps sink world’s first global carbon tax after threatening sanctions against countries supporting it","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The world’s first global carbon tax on the shipping industry, proposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), collapsed after a four-day negotiation in London, with the vote delayed by 12 months.

But after four days of fraught negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after a vociferous US campaign, with President Donald   Trump calling it a “scam tax” and the State Department threatening reprisals on countries supporting it.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say the collapse of the talks marks not only a significant blow for attempts to clean up a heavily climate-polluting industry, undermining decades of negotiations, but also represents  yet another failure  of climate diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  IMO member states  agreed in 2023  that the shipping industry would reach net zero emissions — removing as much planet-heating gas from the atmosphere as it emits — by around 2050.\n \n\n   \n  One of the measures proposed as part of this was a tax on the industry’s climate pollution. The shipping industry would have paid the tax into a fund created by the IMO, to encourage emissions reductions and raise funds for climate action. IMO member nations  approved the tax  at a chaotic April meeting that the US abandoned part way through. The October talks were intended to formally adopt it.\n \n\n   \n  While the tax was supported by members including the European Union, Brazil and small island states such as Vanuatu, oil-producing countries including the United   States and Saudi Arabia opposed it strongly.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration spent weeks calling on countries to reject the vote. The US will “not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” the State Department said in a  statement  this month.\n \n\n   \n  It laid out a series of threats against countries that supported the tax including potentially blocking vessels from US ports, visa restrictions, increased fees and sanctions on “officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on Truth Social Thursday, Trump said he was “outraged” at the vote and that the US “would not stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax.”\n \n\n   \n  After days of chaos and disagreement at the IMO talks, Singapore put forward a motion to delay the decision on Friday, which was called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  A legally-binding carbon tax on shipping would have been a big deal. “It would have marked the first-ever — and legally binding — carbon tax. This explains why petro-states including the United States tried so hard to scuttle the framework,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in culture and climate at the University of Melbourne.\n \n\n   \n  A State Department official told CNN the vote demonstrates American leadership on the global stage: “Now we have a President who will always lead in putting America first and even worked to prevent consumers from around the world from paying higher prices as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The global shipping industry is responsible for  around 3%  of global planet-heating pollution annually, a figure that could rise to 17% by 2050 if no action is taken, according to a 2018 European Parliament  analysis .\n \n\n   \n  The industry has tended to slip under the radar when it comes to climate action, in part because so much of its activity happens in international waters, making the question of accountability for its climate pollution more complex.\n \n\n   \n  The failure to adopt the tax is a huge missed opportunity, experts say .  “Every delay means that innovation will struggle to scale, inequities will deepen, and the transition to clean shipping will become harder and more costly,” said Natacha Stamatiou of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n \n\n   \n  There are also fears about what it means for climate diplomacy. Other recent efforts to tackle the escalating climate crisis have either collapsed, such as attempts to negotiate the world’s first global plastics treaty, or failed to meet hopes, including last year’s COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan,  which ended in bitterness  and a finance deal described by some developing countries as a “betrayal.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts are concerned for what this might mean for ambition levels at the upcoming COP30 climate conference in Belém, Brazil, next month.\n \n\n   \n  The failure of the IMO to adopt a carbon tax “marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” said Ralph John Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate change minister. “This makes the road to Belém and beyond more difficult.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/mpox-monkeypox-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-04:00","title":"California mpox cases raise concerns.

But health officials say the risk remains low \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:53 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   New York (AP)  – Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first US cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case.\n \n\n   \n  The risk to the public is low, officials say.\n \n\n   \n  These are not the US first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.\n \n\n   \n  Both infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.\n \n\n   \n  Long Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”\n \n\n   \n   Mpox  — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.\n \n\n   \n  One version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the US  was averaging  close to 500 cases per day.\n \n\n   \n  The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned  later that year , thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.\n \n\n   \n  The other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.\n \n\n   \n  A newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem  had waned enough  that it was no longer an international emergency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.\n \n\n   \n  The case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding.\n \n\n   \n  Balanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”\n \n\n   \n  A US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/jodie-turner-smith-victorias-secret-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"12:33:00-12:33","title":"Look of the Week: From Jimi Hendrix to Jodie Turner-Smith, why fashion loves a military jacket","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the resurgence of the Hussar jacket — a historical military outerwear — in contemporary fashion.

loves a military jacket \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:33 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attention! The fashion set has just deployed a new fall jacket that could become a wardrobe mainstay for us all. Earlier this week at the Victoria’s Secret after-party in New York, Jodie Turner-Smith arrived in a pair of relaxed, low-slung light wash jeans, a white vest and a black, white and red military jacket that looked nothing short of Napoleonic.\n \n\n   \n  Identifiable by elaborate braiding, decorative buttons, and often toggles across the chest, military coats — also known as the Hussar jacket or Pelisse — appear to be making a comeback. While Turner-Smith, who also attended  the brand’s latest runway show  as a VIP guest, got her Hussar coat from Georgian-based brand Keburia, she’s not the only celebrity who has been spotted in military-style outerwear in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  At Paris Fashion Week, Zendaya was snapped outside the Louis Vuitton show at the Louvre, dressed in a metallic, fur-trimmed dress-coat with a Rococo edge. While some fashion enthusiasts may be revisiting Marie Antoinette as a source of sartorial inspiration in the light of  the blockbuster London exhibition dedicated to the French Queen’s style , Zendaya’s look took more cues from King Louis XVI. The following day at Dior, Jenna Ortega was seen in a gothic black sleeveless Hussar vest, the frog fastenings embroidered intricately with gold thread and finished with shining buttons. She completed her look with aviator sunglasses, bleached brows and a denim mini-skirt.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, this isn’t the first time modern dressers have dusted off 18th-century military outerwear in the name of fashion. The late American guitarist and singer Jimi Hendrix, who once briefly enlisted in the US army, owned and wore several different types of Hussar pelisses in the 1960s. Hendrix wore the coats unbuttoned, sometimes shirtless, and adorned with pendant necklaces; other times he styled them with vibrant silk scarves or blouses, subverting their original context as strict uniforms for obedient, militant officers.\n \n\n   \n  This playful, bohemian upending of a rigid, historical garment started a wave of subversive iterations from luxury brands, including Saint Laurent, Balmain, Gucci and Marc Jacobs — which in 2002 presented cream wool Hussar jackets trimmed with red and finished in gold stitching, worn with paisley blouses that seemed to be   in the Hendrix style. But when The Beatles wore the decorated military coats of yore on the cover of the 1967 album “Sargent Peppers and the Lonely Hearts Club,” it was less about communicating sex appeal and more about anti-establishment and anti-war sentiments. They wore their delicious, candy-colored satin guard coats buttoned to the top, like four fanciful colonels on the regimen of peace and love.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the Hussar pelisse ironically became something of a uniform in the early aughts for musicians, including Michael Jackson, Beyoncé and Rihanna, and bands such as British alt-indie group The Libertines and US pop-punk band My Chemical Romance. In 2005, Kate Moss, then-girlfriend of The Libertines front man Pete Doherty, led the charge in making the trend mainstream with an ivory version worn to the Glastonbury music festival.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the style is back on our catwalks, as seen at Jonathan Anderson’s debut menswear collection for Dior, as well as in recent collections by McQueen, Vaquera and Ann Demeulemeester. And word spreads fast — according to Molly Rooyakkers, who runs the data-driven fashion Instagram account  @styleanalytics , global searches for “Hussar jacket” have increased 300% in October compared to the previous month.

And a  Wall Street Journal investigation  from April found that Meta’s chatbot and other AI chatbots on its platforms would engage in sexual conversations even with accounts identifying as minors.\n \n\n   \n  Meta said its AI characters “are designed not to engage” in conversations with teens about “self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating” or topics that “encourage, promote or enable” those subjects. Teens are also only able to chat with certain AI characters related to content like education and sports, the blog post said.\n \n\n   \n  Instagram’s new parental controls follow other updates the company has recently made to better protect teens. Earlier this week it adjusted its “Teen Accounts” settings to  line up with PG-13 ratings , meaning it won’t show or promote posts featuring strong language or those that could promote “harmful behaviors.” In late September, OpenAI announced parental controls for ChatGPT that reduce “graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/sport/football-ncaa-kansei-matsuzawa-japan-kicker","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:44:00-04:00","title":"The NFL hopeful from Japan who learned to kick on YouTube","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kansei Matsuzawa, a 26-year-old placekicker from Ichikawa, Japan, made global headlines by scoring a game-winning 38-yard field goal against Stanford during the NCAA college football season.

who learned to kick on YouTube \n       \n  By Patrick Snell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:44 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It started with a kick. Since then, Kansei Matsuzawa’s life has never been the same.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old from Ichikawa, Japan, made global headlines on the opening weekend of the  NCAA college football  season after he nailed a 38-yarder as time expired to give the University of Hawaii a dramatic 23-20 victory over Stanford.\n \n\n   \n  It was rich reward for a young athlete who didn’t even know how to kick – or speak English – until he started watching YouTube videos.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one of the best moments in my life. D1 football in America and Japanese kid has big dream,” the young placekicker told  CNN Sports . “In the beginning, when I was in Japan, I had no coaches. So, I feel like I have to do it myself.\n \n\n   \n  “I used YouTube first. I was looking for an  NFL  player on YouTube. I would say (Seattle) Seahawks kicker Jason Myers. I’ve never met him before, but he actually texted me on Instagram after getting the winning field goal and that was amazing. I try to imitate the best of the best and that’s how I started.”\n \n\n   \n  In collegiate sports, the bond between player and coach is often enduringly strong – much more so than at the professional level.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas Sheffield is the Hawaii special teams coordinator who played a key role in bringing Matsuzawa to Honolulu and has nothing but respect and admiration for the life journey Matsuzawa – who has been given the nickname “ the Tokyo Toe ” – has undertaken.\n \n\n   \n  “Who teaches themself how to kick off YouTube? Who goes to America from a completely different country without speaking English and teaches himself basically how to speak English?” Sheffield told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “The word love is used a lot in our profession. I think that as a coach, if you really want to love your players, then you got to get to know your players on a personal level,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa was a stand-out  soccer  player as a teenager, but he failed an exam and didn’t go to college in Japan. His passion, joy and energy were gone. But everything changed when Matsuzawa’s parents offered their son a chance to visit the US.\n \n\n   \n  An  NFL  game between the Las Vegas Raiders and the Los Angeles Rams that he attended fueled his fire to one day return to America and pursue his dreams. It’s no wonder that winning kick against Stanford was so special for both player and coach alike.\n \n\n   \n  “I really wanted to win that game, especially like week zero. Visualization is really important. I was ready for a game-time field goal and a game-winning field goal. I’m telling myself I am elite. And then focus on myself as one of the biggest things,” Matsuzawa revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Sheffield added: “I was like crying like a baby, I just told him, ‘Man, your parents are here to see this.’ That was the coolest part for me was seeing somebody who works so hard and overcome so many battles and so much adversity to get to that moment. And there’s nobody that deserves it more than this kid because of the journey.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rainbow Warriors kicker has had to work hard for all he’s achieved in life so far and especially so when it comes to finances.\n \n\n   \n  Before moving to the US, he would wait tables back in Japan at his local steakhouse in Tokyo. At one point, he was even cutting his own hair to save money. He would upload clips of his kicking to his social media hoping somebody – somewhere – would take notice and give him a chance.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, a school in Nelsonville, Ohio, did and Matsuzawa credits the time he spent at Hocking College before his move to Hawaii as playing a significant role in greatly improving his English. And then there were huge, selfless sacrifices made by his parents, such as the trip the family took to the US.\n \n\n   \n  So just imagine the joy and elation he went through when he learned, at long last, he was to be awarded a scholarship at the University of Hawaii. It was a moment that would cause him to break down in tears.\n \n\n   \n  “That was amazing. I feel like it’s one of the toughest things to walk on to a scholarship in college football. It’s really tough, but (the) coaches believed in me. That moment is so amazing for me and my family,” Matsuzawa said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re paying my tuition, paying my rent. It was tough for my family. My family moved to a different place, a cheaper house, to help.”\n \n\n   \n  The moment Matsuzawa – who’s majoring in sports management – learned he was getting a life-changing scholarship was actually witnessed first-hand by Sheffield himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one recording it. I got to record it because I knew it was coming. It was one of the most rewarding things when you see a kid who just follows his dreams and meets his potential, and that we just get to play a small part of it. It gets you emotionally. It’s like watching your son achieve a big dream and a big goal and reaping the benefits of all the hard work,” Sheffield said.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa says he’s inspired by his idol and compatriot: baseball superstar  Shohei Ohtani .\n \n\n   \n  “Like everyone, I’m just watching him on TV. But his mindset and his preparation are a different level, and if I want to be like him, I have got to have the same mindset and preparation to perform to the highest level.”\n \n\n   \n  And as for Matsuzawa’s future, it won’t surprise you to learn he’s already dreaming big, hoping one day he might even get to play in the  NFL . And if he does, he would become the first Japanese national ever to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of dreams, but since day one, I’m going to NFL, win Super Bowl, play 10 years in the NFL – you know, big contract!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/trump-tomahawk-missiles-zelensky-putin","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:34:00-04:00","title":"Trump hasn’t closed the door on sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has not ruled out sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, despite a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rejected the idea and warned it would damage U.S.-Russia relations.

door on sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Zachary Cohen, Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:34 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  did not take the possibility of the US sending long-range  Tomahawk cruise missiles  to Ukraine off the table during  his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin , sources familiar with their conversation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is also not expected to commit to providing the potentially game changing American-made weapons in  his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  at the White House on Friday, two of the sources said, though they cautioned that things can always change once the president is alone in a room with the Ukrainians.\n \n\n   \n  The US president, in both public and private,  has appeared more willing  to allow Ukraine to obtain the long-range missiles in recent weeks, US officials said. The administration has drawn up plans to provide the weapons to Ukraine, the officials said, in case Trump gives the order, which they stress he can do at any time if he feels it is right.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been holding off, hoping to ascertain from Zelensky a better idea of how he planned to use them, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky and his top aides have described the weapons — which have a range of more than 1,000 miles — as potentially turning the tide in the war against Russia. And they’ve said they viewed the possibility of receiving them as an attractive threat that Zelensky hoped would force Putin back to the table.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s exactly what it appears to have done — though it remains unclear what, if anything, may have changed since Trump and Putin met in Alaska two months ago that would make the prospect of a peace agreement more likely.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 24 hours before Zelensky was slated to meet with Trump in Washington, Putin made a last-ditch attempt to intervene with the American president and halt all talk of sending the lethal US weapons to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  His lengthy phone call resulted in a promise to have the two leaders meet in Budapest “within two weeks or so,” in Trump’s telling — which appears to have bought Moscow more time as Trump’s desire to reach a peace agreement has grown even further following his administration’s success in Middle East negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, did not drop his new military threats while speaking with Putin on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I did actually say, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him. I said it just that way,” Trump told reporters later that day. “He didn’t like the idea.”\n \n\n   \n  A Trump administration official argued it’s all about leverage: “Why would he give up that leverage? He won’t remove the threat until it’s no longer necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  Another US official echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Trump is looking to bring the war to an end and is focusing on a diplomatic approach first — suggesting the threat of sending Tomahawks to Ukraine is one tool he has at his disposal as part of that effort.\n \n\n   \n  Putin is said to have stressed during the call that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield,  CNN previously reported.  But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued.\n \n\n   \n  Putin has previously argued that if Trump chooses to send the long-range missiles to Ukraine, it would completely alter the level of US involvement in the war thus far, noting that the weapons would likely require Americans to operate them.\n \n\n   \n  The risk of escalation is also a concern among some US officials, though others said previous steps that appeared escalatory — like allowing Ukraine to have more powerful missile systems or weapons — did not significantly escalate the conflict.\n \n\n   \n   The story headline has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/swimming-lia-thomas-interview-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:49:00-04:00","title":"It’s easier to fight the whole world than to fight yourself: Why transgender swimmer Lia Thomas wouldn’t change a thing","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lia Thomas, a prominent transgender swimmer and former NCAA women’s champion, has become a focal point in national debates over transgender athletes in women’s sports.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a rare interview,  Lia Thomas  described what life was like as arguably the most prominent transgender swimmer in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas has been the subject of global scrutiny after  winning  a host of NCAA women’s races, triggering an outcry from those who thought she – as a transgender woman – held an unfair advantage over her competitors.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was given extra attention after the Trump administration  ordered  the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), for whom Thomas competed, to erase the transgender swimmer’s records.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Penn  modified a trio  of school records set by Thomas and said it would apologize to the female athletes she competed against.\n \n\n   \n  In an extensive interview with Philadelphia-based public media outlet  WHYY  just before Penn’s decision, Thomas spoke about the impact so much attention has had on her life and career.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas last competed for Penn in 2022 and, in 2024, lost a legal battle against the global swimming governing body  World Aquatics  which prevented her from competing in elite women’s races due to its new policy.\n \n\n   \n  As such, her life as a professional swimmer was over.\n \n\n   \n  “I still swim occasionally, just on my own at a local YMCA,” Thomas told WHYY.\n \n\n   \n  “With everything that happened my senior year and has happened since, it’s very easy to slip into almost like a negative perception of swimming, where swimming and being in the water just brings up all that pain and all those feelings of grief all over again and very fresh. It takes a lot of effort to try to focus on the joy that swimming still brings me.\n \n\n   \n  “There are moments where I can just, I can find that escape that it was for me as a child, and just let everything sort of wash away and it feels almost like I’m flying, and it still absolutely, it can be that place of peace and happiness, but it unfortunately takes a concerted effort at times.”\n \n\n   \n    Finding acceptance\n \n\n   \n  In the interview, Thomas spoke openly about how she struggled with  gender dysphoria  during her younger years and said swimming was often a way of escaping her problems.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said she knew she was trans just before starting college and that it felt like a “wonderful realization” before fears about how people would react came creeping in.\n \n\n   \n  “The toughest conversation was the first time I came out to my parents. And that was the most sort of terrified I’ve ever been in my life,” Thomas said, adding her parents were initially confused but supportive.\n \n\n   \n  “They were caught totally off guard. They had no idea; they did not see it coming.\n \n\n   \n  “What I think essentially happened in between that first conversation and the next conversation was they tried to research what being trans was and meant. And, in doing that, fell into essentially transphobic misinformation rabbit holes.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said her parents needed time to accept her desire to transition and that it took them seeing how happy she was to fully understand her decision. She hopes that, ultimately, the same will happen with sections of society and media.\n \n\n   \n  “They parroted a lot of really transphobic talking points, and it caused a lot of harm.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A North Korean submunition has been found in a drone that was used to attack Ukraine last month, according to a  new report , providing further insight into the extent that Pyongyang is helping Russia wage war on its Eastern European neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  The modified submunition – a small part of a larger weapon – was recovered by Ukrainian authorities following an attack on the port city of Kherson in September, the UK-based investigative organization Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said.\n \n\n   \n  It was marked with Korean characters, some of which referenced the Juche calendar, which counts the years after the birth of North Korea’s founding leader, Kim Il Sung.\n \n\n   \n  According to those characters, the submunition was produced in the year of Juche 89, or 2000 according to the Gregorian calendar, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  While initially designed to be used in a rocket artillery system, it was modified to be attached to a first-person-view drone using a wooden stick, wire and duct tape, CAR said.\n \n\n   \n  The finding “establishes yet another direct material link between the North Korean defence industry and the war in Ukraine,” the investigative organization said.\n \n\n   \n  CAR’s investigation comes as Russia has  ramped up its drone attacks  on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure while rapidly increasing its drone production.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has built a  massive drone factory  to pump out thousands   of weapons, many of which aren’t particularly fast or high-tech, but they are cheap enough for the Kremlin to launch hundreds in one night.\n \n\n   \n  This is done in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses and decimate civilian morale, experts have said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, North Korea has also  ramped up its weapons program  in the past few years, rapidly modernizing its armed forces, developing new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Pyongyang began sending large numbers of troops and equipment to Russia last year. In August, Ukrainian and US intelligence suggested there were roughly 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, the first of whom were sent in the fall of 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Of that initial deployment, about 4,000 soldiers have been killed or wounded, according to Western officials.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-relationship-history","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00-04:00","title":"Jennifer Lopez doesn’t believe she’s ever ‘truly been loved.’ Here’s a reminder of everyone she’s talking about","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jennifer Lopez reflects on her romantic relationships, expressing that she has never truly been loved—not due to lack of desirability, but because her partners have not been emotionally capable.

Lopez said it’s difficult being in a romantic relationship when you are famous.\n \n\n   \n  Stern asked: “Do you think you’ve truly been loved?” She paused and responded “no” before switching to “yes,” as she considered if she had “really experienced loving someone.”\n \n\n   \n  “What I learned is it’s not that I’m not lovable,” she said. “It’s that they’re not capable.”\n \n\n   \n  Who’s not capable? Here’s a reminder of the high-profile relationships Lopez has been in over the years.\n \n\n   \n    Ojani Noa\n \n\n   \n  Lopez was married to the Cuban waiter from 1997 to 1998, which is around the time her career took off, thanks to her starring role in the hit film “Selena” about the beloved murdered Tejano singer.\n \n\n   \n  Noa went on to become a model and actor. He also attempted to publish a tell-all about their relationship which Lopez successfully sued to have blocked.\n \n\n   \n    Sean “Diddy” Combs\n \n\n   \n  Lopez had an on-again and off-again relationship with the music mogul from 1999 to 2001 and they were the focus of a great deal of  media attention in that time. \n \n\n   \n  She stood beside him after the couple, Combs’ bodyguard Anthony “Wolf” Jones and the rapper Shyne Barrow, a Combs protégé, were involved in a disagreement at Club New York in Manhattan that ended with gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were injured, and while the men and Lopez were initially arrested, charges against her were soon dropped. Combs and Jones  were later acquitted in the incident .\n \n\n   \n  Lopez and Combs split in 2001, and two years later  she told Vibe magazine  infidelity played a role in their breakup.\n \n\n   \n  ”It was the first time I was with someone who wasn’t faithful,” she said. “I was in this relationship with Puff” — that’s the nickname Combs went by at the time — “where I was totally crying, crazy and going nuts, it really took my whole life in a tailspin.”\n \n\n   \n    Cris Judd\n \n\n   \n  She married her former backup dancer in 2001 and in 2013 he shared the story of how his life changed after he was cast to dance in her “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” video in 2000.\n \n\n   \n  “So when Jennifer walks in, I shake her hand and we kinda look at each other – and in my head, I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to marry this woman,’” he said during an episode of “Oprah: Where Are They Now?”  as per Huffington Post. \n \n\n   \n  The couple tried to keep their relationship under wraps, Judd said.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess the first introduction to me being with her was when we were at the Oscars. It was just bedlam,” he said. “I’ve never seen so many people concentrated in one place, especially cameras. I knew she was there to do a job, and so I was just that guy who was just by her side.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple finalized their divorce in 2003 — at which time Lopez was already involved with her “Gigli” co-star, Ben Affleck.\n \n\n   \n    Marc Anthony\n \n\n   \n  Lopez was engaged to Affleck (we will circle back to that and him later) from 2002 to 2004 and months after they split, she shocked fans when she married Marc Anthony, the Latino singer and actor.\n \n\n   \n  Lopez and Anthony collaborated on music together and also co-starred in the 2006 film “El Cantante” which was based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe.\n \n\n   \n  In 2008 they welcomed fraternal twins, Emme and Max.\n \n\n   \n  Lopez  talked to British Vogue  in 2024 about motherhood.\n \n\n   \n  “You always want to put your best foot forward for your kids, you want to lift them up — that doesn’t stop you from being a human being who struggles,” she said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She and Anthony announced their split in 2011,  he filed for divorce the following year  and and it was finalized in 2014.\n \n\n   \n    Casper Smart\n \n\n   \n  The dancer-actor-choreographer was one of Lopez’s longest relationships that didn’t make it to the altar.\n \n\n   \n  While they were on-again and off-again, they dated from 2011 to 2016 and Smart had good things to say about her.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s sweet, funny, nice, easygoing and gracious,”  Smart said of Lopez.  “You can’t ask for anything more. She’s beautiful.”\n \n\n   \n  Their breakup was reportedly amicable.\n \n\n   \n    Alex Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Many thought Lopez had met her match in the legendary baseball player.\n \n\n   \n  She and the former New York Yankees shortstop started dating in 2017 and seemed like a match made in social media heaven with their posts of supporting each other in everything from red carpets to yoga class.\n \n\n   \n  The pair got engaged in 2019. But in March 2021, there was some confusion as reports swirled that they had split, only to have them say days later in a statement that they were still a couple after all.\n \n\n   \n  A month later they confirmed that their engagement was off.\n \n\n   \n  “We have realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so. We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects,” they said in a joint statement. “We wish the best for each other and one another’s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.”\n \n\n   \n    Ben Affleck\n \n\n   \n  Lopez spun the block with this actor-director.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after she and Rodriguez broke things off, Affleck was photographed visiting her Los Angeles home.\n \n\n   \n  First time around, of course, the couple had dated and gotten engaged in 2002 before having a high-profile split in September 2003.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date. When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ‘decoy brides’ at three different locations, we realized that something was awry,” they said in a statement. “We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.”\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN at the time that the couple was “taking a break.”\n \n\n   \n  She was with Rodriguez in 2020 when Affleck raved about Lopez  to CNN while promoting his film, “The Way Back.” \n \n\n   \n  He said he had no regrets about making “Gigli” because “I made a great friendship with Jennifer Lopez, who I think is a fabulous person and I’m so excited for her continued success.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think she always got the respect that she deserved, in part, because she was a powerful woman,” he said. “And also because she was a Latina and she was really groundbreaking and nobody wanted to acknowledge that. They just wanted to kind of hate, so it’s nice to see her having that success.”\n \n\n   \n  Affleck and Lopez went public with the fact they were back together in July 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Months later he expressed his gratitude for second chances in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, calling his rekindled romance with Lopez “beautiful.”\n \n\n   \n  “My life now reflects not just the person that I want to be, but the person that I really feel like I am — which is not perfect, but somebody who tries very hard and cares very much about being honest and authentic and accountable,” he told the publication. “It’s hard to say who benefits more, without going into gossipy detail.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair became  engaged  once again in April 2022, after Affleck surprised Lopez with a proposal while she was in the bathtub.\n \n\n   \n  They eloped in July of that year by  traveling to Las Vegas  with their children and the following month held a lavish wedding on Affleck’s sprawling estate outside of Savannah, Georgia, complete with famous friends like Matt Damon and director Kevin Smith in attendance alongside their families.\n \n\n   \n  She  filed for divorce  from Affleck last year, on the anniversary of their second wedding.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/europe/sigfrido-ranucci-bomb-investigative-journalist-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:03:00-04:00","title":"Bomb explodes outside home of top Italian investigative journalist","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bomb exploded outside the home of Italian investigative journalist Sigfrido Ranucci in Campo Ascolano, south of Rome, damaging his car and his daughter’s car while leaving no injuries.

exploded outside the home of one of  Italy’s  top investigative journalists late on Thursday, damaging two cars and a nearby house, prompting messages of solidarity for the reporter from colleagues and politicians.\n \n\n   \n  Sigfrido Ranucci, who hosts RAI’s weekly “Report,”  Italy’s  best-known investigative journalism program, has been under police protection for years. He said both he and his newsroom had received many threats of various kinds, including bullets.\n \n\n   \n  The rudimentary device, likely made from firework explosives, was planted outside the front gate of Ranucci’s house in Campo Ascolano, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Rome, the journalist told state broadcaster RAI on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the explosion happened about 20 minutes after he had returned home.\n \n\n   \n  Both cars – belonging to Ranucci and his daughter – were practically destroyed. Nobody was injured, with Ranucci saying “apart from the shock, all is OK.”\n \n\n   \n  The reporter said he could not say whether the bomb was linked to his work. ANSA news agency said anti-Mafia prosecutors had opened an investigation for criminal damage with aggravating circumstances of mafia-style methods.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the “serious act of intimidation,” adding that “freedom and independence of information are essential values of our democracies, which we will continue to defend.”\n \n\n   \n  Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said Ranucci’s police escort would be stepped up.\n \n\n   \n  “Report” has often clashed with the government, resulting in several members of Meloni’s rightist coalition – including Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, Industry Minister Adolfo Urso, her Brothers of Italy party and her head of cabinet, Gaetano Caputi – suing the program.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/basketball-wnba-becky-hammon-las-vegas-aces-nba-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"08:27:00-04:00","title":"Becky Hammon: No Reason Why Women Can’t Be NBA Head Coaches","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Becky Hammon, head coach of the Las Vegas Aces, asserts there is no reason a woman can't become an NBA head coach, citing her own experience and the growing presence of qualified female coaches.

Vegas Aces head coach Becky Hammon says there is ‘no reason’ a woman can’t become an NBA head coach \n       \n  By Ben Church, Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:27 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Las Vegas Aces  head coach  Becky Hammon  sees no reason why a woman can’t lead an NBA team in her lifetime but told  CNN Sports  that it would take a “whole lot” to pull her away from her current role.\n \n\n   \n  Her comments come after  Dawn Staley , the long-time head coach of the South Carolina women’s basketball team, said she doesn’t believe there will be a female head coach in the NBA during her lifetime.\n \n\n   \n  Staley, who recently interviewed to be head coach of the New York Knicks, also suggested that the  NBA  isn’t ready to have a woman lead an organization.\n \n\n   \n  But Hammon, who recently led the Aces to yet another WNBA championship on October 10, is more optimistic, while acknowledging there needs to be more growth in the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it could happen in our lifetime,” Hammon said to CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “There is really not a good reason why it hasn’t happened already. I think there are qualified women that could coach in the NBA, it’s just the matter of getting that opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Hammon, a six-time WNBA All-Star in her 16-year playing career, is one of the female head coaches that many believe could make the transition to the NBA given her incredible record in the game.\n \n\n   \n  She has now guided Las Vegas to three championships in the past four years after  making history  as the first full-time female assistant coach in NBA history by the San Antonio Spurs in 2014.\n \n\n   \n    NBA experience\n \n\n   \n  During her time in San Antonio, Hammon became the first woman to lead an NBA team as a head coach during the regular season, when she took over for Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich after he was ejected during a game.\n \n\n   \n  She has since said she’s interviewed for several head coaching positions in the league.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was in the NBA, in some ways I thought it could happen right away and then in other ways, I thought this is 20 to 30 years from happening,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “If men can lead women, there is no reason why women can’t lead men. Just because it hasn’t been done, doesn’t mean it can’t be done.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, this is basketball. People follow great characters and great leadership. People follow people that they know can help them.\n \n\n   \n  “In my experience with the NBA, the players were always great. It’s the higher-ups, that are the decision-makers, that have more of an issue of maybe taking directions from a woman.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether she would be interested in taking a head coaching job in the NBA, Hammon said she was very happy with the Aces.\n \n\n   \n  The 48-year-old has helped create the league’s latest dynasty – a term she’s reluctant to fully accept – and is very content with life in Sin City.\n \n\n   \n  However, she said she would take calls if NBA teams wanted to speak.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been building something now for four years,” she said about her time with the Aces. “I love winning, I love the city of Las Vegas and my bosses that I answer to.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll take calls, but it would take a whole lot to pull me from here.”\n \n\n   \n    Dynasty building\n \n\n   \n  Hammon has been enjoying yet another title celebration this week after Las Las Vegas’ most recent triumph.\n \n\n   \n  The Aces secured the third championship in franchise history with a 97-86 win over the Phoenix Mercury last week to sweep the Finals.\n \n\n   \n  With celebrations down the famed Vegas Strip set for Friday, Hammon is relishing in what she called the hardest championship to win.\n \n\n   \n  The start of the 2025 season was a grueling one for the Aces, who began the year 14-14 before winning their last 16 regular season games.\n \n\n   \n  “It hits a little different this year, just the journey and the routes that we had to go through. It was tough. It’s that more rewarding,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “We  fell short last year , I think everybody had to retool a little bit, reroute, gameplan a little bit differently and find a way to get back on top.\n \n\n   \n  “We went around the mountain, up the mountain, down the mountain, back to the mountain top again and it feels really good this time around for sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Many are now calling the Aces basketball’s latest dynasty, but it’s a phrase that doesn’t sit totally comfortably with Hammon.\n \n\n   \n  She does, though, concede her team is “flirting” with the term after dominating the league in recent seasons.\n \n\n   \n  “A dynasty is different because of the culture and standard for what it takes. You see a lot of one-offs in sports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “You got to have a lot of things go your way, you’ve got to have a little luck and you’ve got to get the right pieces and the right pieces playing together at the right time.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/picasso-still-life-guitar-missing-spain-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00+00:00","title":"Picasso painting goes missing en route to exhibition","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 1919 Picasso painting titled 'Still Life with Guitar' vanished during its scheduled delivery to a temporary exhibition at the CajaGranada Cultural Center in Granada, Spain.

disappearance of a painting by  Pablo Picasso  after it apparently vanished on the way to an exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  The 1919 gouache work “Still Life with Guitar,” which measures just 12.7 centimeters by 9.8 centimeters (5 inches x 3.9 inches), was supposed go on display from October 9, as part of a temporary exhibition at CajaGranada Cultural Center in the southern Spanish city of Granada.   \n \n\n   \n  The work is owned by a private collector and was insured for an estimated 600,000 euros ($700,000), the CajaGranada Foundation, which owns the cultural center, confirmed to Reuters Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The Friday before the exhibition was due to open, a van belonging to a transportation company arrived at the cultural center as scheduled to deliver works from Madrid, CajaGranada Foundation said in a press statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  All the works were moved in a single, continuous movement from the van to a freight elevator that took all the transportation company employees at once from floor -1 to floor 1, the center said.\n \n\n   \n  The items were then transferred from the elevator to the exhibition hall under video surveillance, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  After verifying the origins of the different packages, the exhibition manager agreed with the transportation company that the delivery would be signed for, ahead of the unpackaging of the pieces the following Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The packages remained under video surveillance at all time over the weekend, and the unpacking began at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, according to the center.\n \n\n   \n  The recordings have been checked and no incidents occurred over the weekend, it said.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-morning, the CajaGranada Foundation staff had finished unpacking the works and had positioned them in the room.\n \n\n   \n  This is when the exhibition curator and head of exhibitions realized Picasso’s “Still Life with Guitar,” known by its Spanish title as “Naturaleza muerta con guitarra,” was missing.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation then reported the missing work to the police, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The video recordings from the weekend were checked and no incidents had occurred, it said.\n \n\n   \n  “An investigation is currently underway, and the investigation is attempting to determine when and where the painting disappeared,” Granada police said in a statement to CNN on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The police said the missing work has been added to the international database of stolen artworks but noted that there is no international police cooperation currently being carried out from Granada.\n \n\n   \n  Thieves have often targeted Picasso’s paintings, which have fetched up to $179 million at auction.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, a  Dutch art detective recovered Picasso’s 1938 masterpiece  “Portrait of Dora Maar,” worth $28 million, 20 years after it was stolen from the yacht of a Saudi sheikh off the south coast of France.\n \n\n   \n  In 2021,  Greek police recovered Picasso’s “Head of a Woman”  and Piet Mondrian’s “Landscape with a Mill” almost a decade after they were taken in a daring heist at the National Art Gallery in Athens.\n \n\n   \n  And last year,  Belgian police found Picasso’s stolen painting “Tête”  in a basement in the city of Antwerp.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

predecessor that forced schools to place Bibles in classrooms and  incorporate the book  into lesson plans for students.\n \n\n   \n  Superintendent Lindel Fields said in a statement he has “no plans to distribute Bibles or a Biblical character education curriculum in classrooms.”\n \n\n   \n  The directive last year from former Superintendent Ryan Walters drew immediate condemnation from civil rights groups and  prompted a lawsuit  from a group of parents, teachers and religious leaders that is pending before the Oklahoma Supreme Court. It was to have applied to students in grades 5 through 12.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Fields to the superintendent’s post after Walters  resigned last month  to take a job in the private sector.\n \n\n   \n  Jacki Phelps, an attorney for the Oklahoma State Department of Education, said she intends to notify the court of the agency’s plan to rescind the mandate and seek a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they were encouraged by Fields’ decision and plan to discuss next steps with their clients.\n \n\n   \n  “The attempts to promote religion in the classroom and the abuses of power that the Oklahoma State Department of Education engaged in under Walters’ tenure should never happen in Oklahoma or anywhere in the United States again,” the attorneys said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Many schools districts across the state had  decided not to comply  with the Bible mandate.\n \n\n   \n  A spokeswoman for the state education department, Tara Thompson, said Fields believes the decision on whether the Bible should be incorporated into classroom instruction is one best left up to individual districts and that spending money on Bibles is not the best use of taxpayer resources.\n \n\n   \n  Walters in March had announced plans to team up with  country music singer Lee Greenwood  seeking donations to get Bibles into classrooms after a legislative panel rejected his $3 million request to fund the effort.\n \n\n   \n  Walters, a far-right Republican, made  fighting “woke ideology” , banning certain books from school libraries and getting rid of “radical leftists” who he claims were indoctrinating children in classrooms a focal point of his administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since his election in 2020, he imposed a number of mandates on public schools and worked to develop  new social studies standards  for K-12 public school students that included teaching about conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election. Those standards  have been put on hold  while a lawsuit challenging them moves forward.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson said the agency plans to review all of Walters’ edicts, including a requirement that applicants from teacher jobs coming from California and New York  take an ideology exam , to determine if those may also be rescinded.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to review all of those mandates and provide clarity to schools moving forward,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/baseball-mlb-dodgers-brewers-nlcs-alcs-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"07:46:00-04:00","title":"Dodgers close in on second straight World Series appearance, Blue Jays knot up ALCS against Mariners","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Los Angeles Dodgers extend their lead in the National League Championship Series with a 3-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, moving to a 3-0 series lead and positioning themselves as the first team in 16 years to win back-to-back World Series appearances.

Dodgers  moved one game away from reaching a second consecutive World Series with a 3-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers now lead the Brewers 3-0 in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series (NLCS) and would become the first defending champion to make the World Series in 16 years.\n \n\n   \n  The Philadelphia Phillies were the last team to achieve that feat in 2009, while no team has won back-to-back World Series since the New York Yankees clinched three in a row between 1998 and 2000.\n \n\n   \n  Brewers pitcher Jacob Misiorowski’s excellent performance from the mound – striking out nine, a Milwaukee rookie postseason record – ensured that Thursday’s game was a tight affair through five innings, but LA took the lead in the sixth on Tommy Edman’s RBI single.\n \n\n   \n  A throwing error from Abner Uribe then allowed Freddie Freeman to score, resulting in the Dodgers going 3-1 ahead and closing out the game.\n \n\n   \n  The chances of reaching the World Series are now heavily stacked in LA’s favor. Only the Boston Red Sox in 2004 have gone on to win a best-of-seven series after losing the first three games, with teams holding a 3-0 lead winning on 40 other occasions, per MLB.com.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re really excited,” Edman told reporters. “It’s been a bit of a trying year, we didn’t play the best during the regular season, but we’re getting hot at the right time and are just one win away. Hopefully, we can finish it off tomorrow.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers had to come through a wild card round against the Cincinnati Reds but are now 8-1 this postseason, their only loss coming against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL Division Series.\n \n\n   \n  A second straight World Series appearance seems almost certain, but less obvious is who the Dodgers could face next. After trailing the Seattle Mariners 2-0 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), the  Toronto Blue Jays  have hit back by outscoring the Mariners 21-6 across Games 3 and 4 to tie the series.\n \n\n   \n  Max Scherzer, aged 41 and playing in his 18th MLB season, allowed only two runs and three hits in 5 2/3 innings, while Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his fifth home run of the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The road team has won each of the first four games in this series, which remains in Seattle for Friday’s Game 5. The Blue Jays will be hoping to ride their momentum and take the series lead for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re in the biggest moment of the season right now, these games are must-win, every single one of them,” Scherzer told reporters. “When you get success, it’s great. This is what you play for. You work so hard the whole year, make all the sacrifices, put all the work in to get to this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just a great effort by our team all the way around – our offense, our defense, our relievers,” he added. “Everyone contributed tonight and that’s what makes it special.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/baek-se-hee-author-dies-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"06:45:00-04:00","title":"Baek Se-hee, author of bestselling memoir ‘I Want To Die But I Want To Eat Tteokbokki,’ dead at 35","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korean author Baek Se-hee, known for her deeply personal memoirs on mental health and depression, has died at the age of 35.

Here’s what the experts say \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lindsey Martin’s electricity bill reached $314 in July, the highest bill she had received this year until that point, she said on TikTok. In the video’s more than 4,000 comments, many users reported similar power-bill spikes.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s bill jumped even higher in August to $372, a notable leap from around $150 two to three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was so high, I could not believe my bill was $150,” Martin, a Kentucky-based registered nurse, told CNN over the phone. “And now I wish my bill was $150.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin isn’t alone. Residential electricity costs are on the rise, according to  data  from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The average price of electricity in America has increased 13% since 2022, with the cost of retail electricity expected to grow faster than the rate of inflation, the report says. Some regions, like the Pacific, Middle Atlantic and New England, could see even higher increases than the national average.\n \n\n   \n  The increases have largely been driven by the costs of updating and maintaining the power grid and other necessary infrastructure, particularly in the face of increasingly common severe weather events, according to experts on energy and computing who spoke with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But a new technological wave is also driving up electricity bills: The AI boom is boosting electricity demand and power resources as tech giants pour billions into what many believe is the biggest computing shift in decades. OpenAI and Broadcom announced  a partnership  just this week to design and develop 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips and systems, more than enough to power a major city.\n \n\n   \n  That trend is only expected to continue. Data centers are projected to consume approximately 6.7% to 12% of US electricity in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, according to a December 2024 report from the  Department of Energy . A  Bloomberg News analysis  found that areas near data centers saw an increase in electricity costs of as much as 267% compared to five years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The power industry just isn’t equipped to keep up, said Bob Johnson, an analyst with market research firm Gartner who follows the semiconductor industry.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Explosion in demand’ for AI\n \n\n   \n  Investment in data centers has moved fast as tech behemoths stake the future of their businesses on AI. Meta said it spent $17 billion in capital expenditures, which typically refers to money spent on data centers and infrastructure, for the quarter that ended in June, while Microsoft said it spent $24.2 billion. Data center construction spending reached  a high of $40 billion  in June, according to a Bank of America Institute report.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers likely need to be updated to ensure they have enough capacity to handle new power-hungry AI services and products.\n \n\n   \n  That growth is contributing to more electricity demand than the United States has seen in two decades, leading to a need for more investment in electricity generation and transmission, said Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a trade group that represents electricity buyers.\n \n\n   \n  Other factors behind the increased demand include a shift to electric-based heating systems in homes and new manufacturing plants, according to the Bank of America report.\n \n\n   \n  There weren’t enough data center construction and upgrades in the past to affect consumer prices, said Ram Rajagopal, senior fellow for Stanford University’s Precourt Institute for Energy. But now the AI industry is seeing an “explosion in demand.”\n \n\n   \n  AI tools are also growing increasingly sophisticated, evolving beyond text-based queries to handle complex tasks like generating realistic video clips in a matter of seconds and coding websites from scratch. This means they also require more resources than ever.\n \n\n   \n  “AI is really computationally intensive,” said Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside.\n \n\n   \n    What goes into your electricity bill\n \n\n   \n  Rates vary by location, but retail electricity prices generally include the “cost of generating, transmitting and delivering” electricity and can sometimes factor in investment in upgrading infrastructure, according to the EIA.\n \n\n   \n  Large buyers of electricity typically pay lower rates because the distribution infrastructure is less complex; power needs to be piped to one location rather than hundreds or thousands of homes, said Johnson. Pricing models haven’t been updated to take into account the surge in data center growth, he said, although that can vary by location.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon, for example,  passed a bill  requiring data centers to “pay for the actual strain they place on Oregon’s electrical grid” so that the costs don’t get passed on to the consumer.\n \n\n   \n  “In other words, the homeowners shouldn’t have to pay for data centers, but that’s not built into the pricing structure,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/soccer-europa-league-maccabi-tel-aviv-fan-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:01:00Z","title":"UK Authorities Seek to Reverse Decision to Ban Maccabi Tel Aviv Fans from Villa Game","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"UK authorities have initiated efforts to reverse a ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending their Europa League match against Aston Villa on November 6, 2025, following concerns over public safety.

officials said Friday they were working to reverse  a ban  on Maccabi Tel Aviv  soccer  fans attending a Europa League game at Aston Villa next month because of security concerns, a decision that drew condemnation from politicians, sports organizations and Jewish groups.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister  Keir Starmer  said the police recommendation to bar the visiting team’s fans from the November 6 game was  “the wrong decision,”  and European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, urged British authorities to ensure the Israeli team’s fans could go to the match.\n \n\n   \n  “UEFA wants fans to be able to travel and support their team in a safe, secure and welcoming environment, and encourages both teams and the competent authorities to agree on the implementation of appropriate measures necessary to allow this to happen,” it said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Ian Murray, a minister in the department for culture, media and sport, said the government “will do everything we possibly can to resolve this issue.” He said Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy “will be meeting with the Home Office and other stakeholders today to try and see if there’s a way through this.”\n \n\n   \n  Aston Villa  said in a statement  that police had informed the club that “they have public safety concerns outside the stadium bowl and the ability to deal with any potential protests on the night.”\n \n\n   \n   West

that took place when Maccabi Tel Aviv played Ajax  in Amsterdam last season .\n \n\n   \n  The fan ban was swiftly criticized by Starmer, who said “the role of the police is to ensure all football

took place at the stadium in Thessaloniki, Greece when the club played PAOK on September 24.\n \n\n   \n  About 120 fans of the Israeli club traveled to Greece for that game and were held behind a

the job have a new worry: Taking a day off during the shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, René Marsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One essential Social Security employee didn’t foresee her surgery being upended by the  federal government shutdown  when she scheduled it for early October.\n \n\n   \n  But the longtime manager decided to postpone the procedure, which would have required her to take two weeks off to recover, fearing that she could lose her job if she was absent from work.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because taking sick leave during the shutdown would result in her being furloughed for those days. What’s more, the furlough notice would be filed under “disciplinary and adverse actions” in her employee record — an unprecedented categorization during a funding lapse, according to a Social Security union leader and outside experts in government service. (CNN has viewed the agency’s FAQ instructing supervisors to store furlough notices under that designation.)\n \n\n   \n  Between that potential black mark and the  general sense of anxiety  pervading her office, the employee said she felt, “This is not the time. I could not take a chance on having weeks of furlough and being laid off.”\n \n\n   \n  Essential workers at several federal agencies said they are worried about taking time off or are being told that requests for leave would not be granted during the shutdown, which began on October 1 after Congress failed to agree to a federal spending package. It’s adding to the insecurity they have felt all year as the Trump administration overhauls and downsizes the federal workforce.\n \n\n   \n  A government shutdown is often stressful both for furloughed employees, who are not allowed to work, and for certain essential staffers, who must still report for duty, because  neither group is paid  until after the shutdown ends. But this impasse is even more fraught because President Donald Trump is threatening federal workers’ jobs and their ability to get back pay.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has already issued  reductions in force, or RIF, notices  to about 4,100 federal workers over the past week — a move that a  federal judge paused  on Wednesday, declaring it unlawful — and has warned  it will lay off thousands  more during the shutdown. Plus, Trump has called into question a 2019 law that guarantees that furloughed workers will receive  retroactive compensation  once the government reopens, though lawmakers remain far from reaching a deal.\n \n\n   \n  One employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs told CNN that his supervisor asked him if he was sure he wanted to take his preapproved time off during the shutdown, a question he’d never been asked before and one that put him on edge. He thought about canceling his vacation, but decided not to, despite being unsure whether he’ll be paid for those days and whether his absence will jeopardize his career.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m mad, so I’m just going to take it off,” he said — though the uncertainty casts a shadow over his vacation.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s standard for essential employees to be listed as furloughed for the hours or days they miss work during an impasse, that designation is more risky now, workers said.\n \n\n   \n  “It shows who the agency can run without,” the Social Security manager said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about categorizing furlough notices as “disciplinary and adverse action,” a Social Security Administration spokesperson said, “SSA has followed its standard practice for how it manages furlough activities during a government lapse in appropriation, including how we provide notice to staff on their furlough status and where we have always stored the notices in our personnel records.”\n \n\n   \n    Mixed messages on leave\n \n\n   \n  Internal Revenue Service employees in Atlanta have received “conflicting guidance from managers about whether essential workers could take scheduled leave or medical time off,” Denise Wells-Gomez, National Treasury Employees Union chapter president, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Messages viewed by CNN instructed essential staff that vacation or sick leave could not be used and that any absence, even for surgeries or medical procedures, would be treated as AWOL (absent without leave).\n \n\n   \n  One internal message from managers to staff, viewed by CNN, warned that they could be terminated if employees weren’t present the day they decide to do an audit.\n \n\n   \n  However, during a staff meeting, the director of the IRS Atlanta office appeared unaware this guidance was being circulated and clarified that essential workers could still take leave if it was approved by their manager. Despite that, employees continued receiving instructions that “no exceptions” would be allowed.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, at the VA, a regional director informed staffers that they could take leave that had already been approved before the shutdown, but no new leave would be authorized, the agency employee told CNN. The worker’s supervisor said the same thing.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS and VA did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple employees in different Social Security offices have told Joel Smith, their union representative, that their supervisors have said that if they don’t show up for work, they could be let go. Having their furlough notices filed as a disciplinary action — which he said has not happened in the past — is compounding their concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “People are feeling they have to choose between their job and their health,” said Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3184, which represents about 6,000 Social Security workers in offices across the South and Southwest.\n \n\n   \n  Taking a day off during a shutdown is not dishonorable, said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that focuses on improving the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Having it “be a black mark on your record is, as they say, piling mistreatment upon mistreatment, and, to my knowledge, has never been done before,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/football-nfl-week-8-bengals-steelers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"06:11:00-04:00","title":"Joe Flacco outduels Aaron Rodgers in battle of elder statesmen as Bengals stun Steelers in ‘Icy Hot Bowl’","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-stakes Thursday Night Football showdown dubbed the 'Icy Hot Bowl,' 40-year-old Joe Flacco outperformed 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers in a dramatic 33-31 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

\nUpdated: \n        6:11 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the  NFL  remains a young man’s game as a whole, Thursday Night Football was a good example that the old guys can still sling it.\n \n\n   \n  The contest saw 40-year-old Joe Flacco face 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers as the Cincinnati Bengals hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers and was dubbed the “Icy Hot Bowl” by Rodgers’ Steelers teammate, Cameron Heyward, beforehand.\n \n\n   \n  And despite having a combined age of 81, the two oldest quarterbacks in the NFL currently showed that they can still produce on the top level, with both having productive outings in a high-scoring affair.\n \n\n   \n  In the end though, it was Flacco – making just his second Bengals start since being traded from the Cleveland Browns – who came out on top, with the Bengals winning 33-31.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns – one apiece to Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Noah Fant – as well as orchestrating a  field goal  drive in the final minutes which would turn out to be the decisive score.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco was parachuted into Cincinnati following the long-term toe injury suffered by  Joe Burrow  and the streaky play of back-up passer Jake Browning. And after losing his debut to the Green Bay Packers last week, the Super Bowl XLVII champion got in the win column to keep the Bengals’ season alive at 3-4.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what we do it for is games like that,” Flacco said after the victory. “It came down to the wire just like we know it’s going to. Really, really happy about how the guys just kind of stayed with it for a full 60 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  “Man, our offensive line was going today. We were running the football, protecting, doing a lot of things that we wanted to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh had raced out into a 10-0 lead midway through the second quarter but 20 straight points from the Bengals put them on top at Paycor Stadium.\n \n\n   \n  The teams traded scores until a long 68-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to tight end Pat Freiermuth and the ensuing extra point gave the Steelers a one-point lead with just over two minutes remaining.\n \n\n   \n  But the experienced Flacco was able to put together an eight-play, 52-yard drive which drained the majority of the clock to set up a 36-yard field goal for Evan McPherson which he converted to give the home team a two-point lead.\n \n\n   \n  It left Rodgers and the Steelers just seven seconds to attempt a miracle comeback but it came to nothing and Flacco had his first win in Cincinnati.\n \n\n   \n  “Outstanding. Outstanding. Outstanding. It was outstanding, really,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said of Flacco’s night.\n \n\n   \n  “We scored on, what, like six of the last seven drives maybe? Seven of the last eight. And really early on, we had some drops and some quirky stuff happen that prevented a score there. So, just thought his performance was outstanding. Very calm, collected, led us in the two-minute drive to go win the game.”\n \n\n   \n  A key reason for trading for Flacco was the hope that he’d get their star-studded offense firing and he seems to have done so. Both Chase and Higgins had big nights – Chase had 16 catches for 161 yards while Higgins had six catches for 96 yards, a season high – and the running game had its best outing so far this year, with Chase Brown rushing for over 100 yards for the first time this season.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the defeat, it was a productive evening for Steelers quarterback Rodgers who threw four touchdowns and two interceptions on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  There was a moment of history for the former Green Bay Packers and New York Jets star during the game, as he  moved up to fifth place  in the all-time career passing yards leaderboard, moving past Pittsburgh’s all-time leading passer and long-time contemporary Ben Roethlisberger.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers needed 116 passing yards to pass Roethlisberger and cruised past him with a 15-yard connection with Jaylen Warren in the second quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers finished the game with 64,222 yards, still over 7,000 yards behind Brett Favre in fourth.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers fall to 4-2 but still remain atop the AFC North with a big clash against the Green Bay Packers to come in Week 8 on Sunday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/wisconsin-man-tiktok-ice-agents-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:58:00-04:00","title":"Wisconsin man charged after posting TikTok videos calling for the killing of ICE agents, prosecutors say","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrew Stanton, a 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been charged with threatening to assault, kidnap, or murder U.S. federal officials after posting a series of TikTok videos between August and October 2025.

with making threats against federal law enforcement after posting a series of TikTok videos in which he called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to be shot and killed, according to federal prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Stanton, 38, of Kenosha, was arrested last week and indicted Wednesday on three federal charges, including threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a US official, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  His arrest comes amid heightened tensions nationwide over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operations and criticism over  aggressive tactics  observed to be used by immigration agents. The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst” and that its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  Stanton pleaded not guilty during his arraignment Thursday in US District Court in Milwaukee.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Stanton was behind multiple threatening TikTok videos posted from various accounts between August and October this year, according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  In one video posted four days before his arrest, Stanton allegedly called for ICE agents to be targeted, saying in the video, “If they (ICE) show up to your neighborhood…it’s time we start shooting at you,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Stanton’s attorney for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to the  New York Times , John Bradley, a lawyer for Stanton, said: “It is important to remember that the contents of a criminal complaint represent one side of the story and are just allegations. Mr. Stanton pled not guilty. He is presumed innocent, and we will vigorously defend against these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Stanton is also accused of suggesting that mass shootings can be applied to federal agents, prosecutors said, citing a video posted in September. He also keyed on the September 10 murder of conservative political activist  Charlie Kirk , saying “do a lot more Charlie Kirks,” in a video posted that same day, the complaint alleges.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities started looking into Stanton’s online activity in August after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, a federal office that tracks suspected terror activity. Federal investigators flagged that an account registered to Stanton asked for information about the whereabouts of members of the Israeli military in the Illinois and Wisconsin area, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  A video posted near the end of August also featured Stanton with text superimposed on the screen that read in part, “a violent state can only be stopped with violence in return” and “I think we should be OFFING federal agents,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to use bullets,” he was quoted as saying in the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Federal law enforcement officers tried to interview Stanton multiple times, in person and over the phone, in early September but were unsuccessful, the complaint said.\n \n\n   \n  On September 11, a supervisor with US Customs and Border Patrol identified himself by first name in a text to Stanton and said he wanted to speak with him about his recent posts. In response, Stanton told him to go away, using an expletive, and sent a series of hostile messages, as well as one asking to meet in person, the complaint alleges.\n \n\n   \n  A pretrial conference in Stanton’s case is scheduled for December 1, and his trial is scheduled for December 15, according to federal court records. Last week, a judge ordered Stanton to remain in detention pending his trial.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/ice-arrests-chicago-suburb-police-officer-hanover-park","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:41:00-04:00","title":"ICE arrests police officer in Chicago suburb and accuses him of being in US illegally","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"ICE arrested Radule Bojovic, a newly hired police officer in Hanover Park, Illinois, accusing him of overstaying his 2015 tourist visa and living illegally in the U.S. for over a decade.

Su was a superstar.\n \n\n   \n  Now boasting over 300,000 followers on  Instagram  and over 2,000,000 on Chinese social media platform Weibo, Su is one of the most recognizable faces heading into next year’s Winter Olympics in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel really honored and feel really lucky to have so many people who always look at me,” he tells  CNN Sports  from a training camp in Switzerland.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m always looking up to my idols, in snowboarding or even in life, so I really know what it means to the younger generation to look up to their idol.\n \n\n   \n  “I really try to be better, and try to show young people that once you have a dream, once you have something you love, just putting 100% to go chase for your dream, and then it will come one day.”\n \n\n   \n    Path to Mount Olympus\n \n\n   \n  Su’s rise to Olympic champion is no accident.\n \n\n   \n  Both his mom and dad were snowboarders and he remembers finding himself playing on the slopes from the age of four, when his parents couldn’t find anyone else to look after him.\n \n\n   \n  At first, he used a board that was bigger than he was. It took a while, almost five years, before he grew into it.\n \n\n   \n  By then, the slopes in northern China became his second home. It’s a place which feels totally natural to Su. In today’s fast-paced world, where he finds himself being pulled from one major city to another, the 21-year-old still longs to spend time out in the wild, where the only thing that matters is having fun on his board.\n \n\n   \n    Life as a film star\n \n\n   \n  But before he became a sporting icon, Su’s first break into the public consciousness came in the world of acting.\n \n\n   \n  When producers of a new film were looking for a child who was comfortable on the snow, Su swapped out his board for skis to play Zi Shuan in the popular film “The Taking of Tiger Mountain.”\n \n\n   \n  The film and his character struck a chord with the Chinese public and Su saw his acting career blossom, going on to feature in several other films and television series.\n \n\n   \n  “That memory just gives me a really special feeling,” he said, looking back at his time as a child actor.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m pretty sure a lot of people at that age can’t experience so many crazy things. It’s pretty crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  But while his acting career went from strength to strength, he never let go of his love for snowboarding and a fire was lit in his heart after Beijing was picked to host the 2022 Winter Games.\n \n\n   \n  He turned his attention full-time to the sport in 2018, competing in his first proper competition a year later where his potential was clear to see.\n \n\n   \n    Making of a champion\n \n\n   \n  Whether he performed well or poorly in competitions, the youngster kept dreaming of making it to the Olympics and dedicated his entire life to improving.\n \n\n   \n  Then, after a stellar year before the Games, Su was chosen to represent his nation. What happened next, was just the icing on the cake.\n \n\n   \n  He won two medals, the first a silver and then the magical gold. It was the defining moment of his young life.\n \n\n   \n  But after the fanfare died down, Su was left with a hole. For most of his teenage life, he had dreamed of winning gold at the Winter Olympics. Once he achieved his wildest ambition, there was a period of transition where he lost his motivation.\n \n\n   \n  “I kind of lost my passion for competing,” he said. “I still loved snowboarding, but I decided to take a year and a half off to take some rest for my mental and also for my body.\n \n\n   \n  “Every morning I woke up, there was a dream, some goal you wanted to chase for, that’s why you put in your 100% and work really hard.\n \n\n   \n  “But right after I won the gold, the next morning I woke up and thought there was nothing else I wanted. It feels really empty at that point.”\n \n\n   \n  Much like other sporting prodigies, such as US tennis star  Amanda Anisimova , Su spent the ensuing months recharging his batteries. He enjoyed time off with family and friends, immersing himself in nature and pursuing his other interests, such as fashion.\n \n\n   \n  “I still got out snowboarding, but just without any purpose, and not for competition, just trying to have fun,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that definitely helped. I felt like I just needed some time to take a rest – snowboarding is just a part of my life.”\n \n\n   \n  After that reset, he returned to competitive snowboarding with a new ambition of retaining his Olympic title in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  Life, for him, looks very different heading into his second Winter Games and Su knows there will be a target on his back during the competition.\n \n\n   \n  “I got more pressure going into the next Olympics because, for the last one, I was just kind of a nobody, and it was just more about challenging myself,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “People are expecting more from you, and that’s why you feel pressure from yourself. But I spent a lot of time talking to my family and I took those years off after the Olympics to set my mind in the right spot. I use those pressures for motivation.”\n \n\n   \n    Pool, fishing and surfing\n \n\n   \n  Su knows he’s in the privileged position of being in high demand. He has ventures in several different fields and is growing his profile around the world.\n \n\n   \n  It’s exhausting just hearing about the things such a young man can fit into his 24 hours, but it’s a schedule that seems to energize him.\n \n\n   \n  But balance, he said, helps him enjoy his often hectic life and career.\n \n\n   \n  While his stock is rocketing around the world, the skateboarding sensation remains humble, grounded by those who know him best.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a pretty chilled guy, especially when I’m back home. It’s the time you can finally relax,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been enjoying spending time with family, just eating dinner together and then having a conversation. That feels really special, it’s like recharging.\n \n\n   \n  “Also, when at home, I go play pool with my friends and I go fishing and surfing. I’m not the guy who wants to be at home and watch his phone or a movie. I’m trying to get close to nature and doing a lot of stuff that feels like I’m connected to nature.”\n \n\n   \n  But the world is set to see the other side of Su in February next year, the one capable of being the best snowboarder on the planet.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/business/stay-or-pay-agreements-leaving-job-employer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"When You Have to Pay Your Employer Money If You Quit Your Job","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing number of workers are facing financial obligations upon leaving jobs due to 'stay-or-pay' agreements, which require repayment of benefits like training or signing bonuses if they leave before a set retention period.

money if you quit your job \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Most people go to work for the paycheck and benefits. What they typically don’t expect is to have to return   some of the money   when they leave.\n \n\n   \n  But with some benefits — such as signing or retention bonuses, tuition reimbursement and some forms of training — workers may have to pay their employer back if they’re subject to a so-called stay-or-pay agreement, which specifies that the employee will be on the hook to repay the company for the cost of certain benefits if they don’t stay at the organization for a minimum amount of time.\n \n\n   \n  Why? On the one hand, “employers are trying to get a reasonable return on their investment,” said Jonathan Crook, a partner at Fisher Phillips, which represents management in labor and employment matters.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, paying for benefits intended to attract or retain employees only to have them get the benefit and then quit — and potentially work for a competitor — doesn’t offer a great ROI for the employer.\n \n\n   \n  But there are some instances when “stay or pay” agreements are viewed as abusive and limiting employee mobility, especially when they apply to lower income workers and involving what are called training repayment agreements (sometimes referred to, especially by critics, as TRAPs).\n \n\n   \n  “TRAPs are often forced on workers as a condition of employment and require workers who receive on-the-job training — regardless of the quality or necessity of that training — to pay back the supposed cost if they leave their job before the end of a specified term,” Chris Hicks, a senior policy adviser at consumer advocacy group Protect Borrowers,  wrote  in a blog.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, they might charge a quitting fee of thousands of dollars, should an employee leave for another job.\n \n\n   \n  Even if a contract is not enforced, labor advocates say, just knowing of its existence still can pressure employees into staying rather than seeking a better job elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how widespread stay-or-pay agreements are. Researchers from the University of Michigan, Cornell University and the University of Maryland estimated that such agreements — including anything from on-the-job training to paying for an employee’s MBA program — could affect as many as  1 in 11 workers (8.7%) .\n \n\n   \n  Historically, according to a  2023 report  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Employers’ use of TRAPs began in the 1990s, predominantly for higher-skilled, higher-wage positions, such as engineers, securities brokers, and airline pilots. Still in use in those industries, they are now also common in lower- and moderate-wage industries where jobs are disproportionately held by women and minorities, such as in the healthcare, transportation, and retail industries.”\n \n\n   \n    New California law bans certain provisions, allows others\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a first-in-the-nation  measure  banning certain stay-or-pay provisions and putting guardrails around others. It takes effect on January 1, 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Among the new prohibitions: California-based employers may not seek repayment for on-the-job training, except for apprentice programs approved by the  Division of Apprenticeship Standards . And they may not seek repayment for any type of benefit when a worker is let go without cause or their job is eliminated.\n \n\n   \n  But the new law still allows employers to impose some types of stay-or-pay agreements if they meet certain guardrails. Among those still allowed in addition to approved apprentice programs are signing or retention bonuses, government-sponsored loan repayment assistance and tuition reimbursement but only for “transferable credentials” (meaning a degree or certificate from an accredited third party that is not specific to the person’s job). In terms of bonuses and tuition reimbursement, if an employee leaves sooner than the stay period, the amount of money they need to repay must be prorated. So if an employee gets a signing bonus but only stays at the company for half the time required, they will only need to pay the company half the amount when they leave.\n \n\n   \n  Employees also must have the option to take their bonus when they leave the company rather than when they start, so they don’t risk owing money if they leave before the end of the stay period — which will now be limited to two years and may not include interest accrual.\n \n\n   \n  The move was welcomed by the California Nurses Association, which represents one of the industries in which such stay-or-pay agreements have been used. “With the threat of having to pay back a debt or fee to their employer, ‘stay-or-pay’ contracts indenture workers to remain at a job and chills workers from seeking better wages or working conditions,” the union said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  It is too early to predict how the new law will influence the way employers operating across multiple states, including California, might draft their own stay-or-pay provisions, Crook said.\n \n\n   \n  Or how many other states may follow in California’s footsteps.\n \n\n   \n  Protect Borrowers notes that there have been legislative efforts to restrict stay-or-pay agreements in several other states, including New York, which passed the “Trapped at Work Act” in June, although it has yet to be signed by Governor Kathy Hochul.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/why-the-bolton-indictment-is-different-from-comey-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Why the Bolton Indictment is Different from the Comey and James Cases","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including sharing sensitive data with family members without proper clearances.

He allegedly shared the information with family members who didn’t have security clearances.\n \n\n   \n  That rapid progression means Bolton’s indictment will often be lumped in with Comey’s and James’s as an example of Trump weaponizing the justice system against his foes. Trump’s role in orchestrating the charges against Comey and James has certainly warranted that narrative, given it has  no parallel in decades of American politics .\n \n\n   \n  “Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,” Bolton said in a statement late Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton’s lawyer Abbe Lowell denied that Bolton had kept or shared classified information and said records he claimed the charges stem from were “known to the FBI as far back as 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  But there are also some key differences in Bolton’s case and suggestions that it could be more substantial than those brought against James and Comey.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s dig in.\n \n\n   \n    The differences\n \n\n   \n   The way the case was brought \n \n\n   \n  In Bolton’s case, there is less of a throughline between Trump’s conduct and the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, Bolton is also someone Trump spotlighted for prosecution, like Comey and James. As far back as 2020, Trump accused Bolton of breaking the law and warned there would be “a really big price to pay.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now he will have bombs dropped on him!” Trump  said .\n \n\n   \n  But Trump doesn’t appear to have played a similar role in orchestrating the charges against Bolton, at least from what we know. He didn’t publicly push for the charges as much in recent weeks. And he certainly didn’t force out a prosecutor who resisted the charges before installing a loyalist who brought them, like he did in the Eastern District of Virginia (the site of the Comey and James cases).\n \n\n   \n  The Bolton charges also were ultimately brought by experienced prosecutors, including US Attorney Kelly O. Hayes, who has served in the District of Maryland since 2013, and nonpartisan career prosecutor Tom Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  In Comey’s and James’s cases, Trump’s handpicked US Attorney Lindsey Halligan was essentially forced to bring the charges herself, after other prosecutors balked or were removed.\n \n\n   \n   A judge once suggested Bolton might have broken the law \n \n\n   \n  That Bolton is facing charges isn’t nearly as surprising. In fact, a federal judge back in 2020 basically warned of exactly that.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled in Bolton’s favor in a civil case stemming from a dispute with the Trump administration over the publication of Bolton’s book. But Lamberth otherwise  excoriated Bolton  for his handling of classified information.\n \n\n   \n  Lamberth said in  his ruling  that Bolton “likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  “He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability,” Lamberth said in his conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s charges are somewhat different than the issues in that civil case, in that Bolton is charged with retaining and transmitting sensitive information, rather than publishing it in his book as the administration claimed back then. But Lamberth certainly felt Bolton had played fast and loose with this information, which is at the heart of the charges.\n \n\n   \n  There are also other reasons to believe this case is more substantial.\n \n\n   \n  Those include the fact that a judge greenlit  a search of Bolton’s properties  back in August. CNN has also reported that, while the Biden Justice Department didn’t bring these charges, this particular focus of the investigation began under the Biden administration. And the indictment also includes much more detail than the Comey and James indictments, suggesting a more thorough investigation.\n \n\n   \n   The stakes \n \n\n   \n  What Bolton is accused of is, quite simply, a much bigger deal than Comey’s alleged false statement to Congress and James’s alleged mortgage fraud – an alleged offense which even the available evidence suggests would  only have netted her a few thousand dollars .\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Bolton isn’t just accused of retaining and transmitting the information; the indictment also claims this information could have been exposed to hostile foreign actors.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment states that, sometime in the two years after Bolton left the White House in 2019, “a cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran hacked BOLTON’s personal email account and gained unauthorized access to the classified and national defense information in that account.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment says Bolton notified the government of the hack but not the potential exposure of sensitive information.\n \n\n   \n  CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said that, if that can be proved, it will show Bolton’s mishandling of classified information  to be more serious  than the series of prominent politicians facing similar problems in recent years – including Hillary Clinton and Trump himself.\n \n\n   \n    The similarities\n \n\n   \n   Trump has singled out Bolton \n \n\n   \n  Even as Trump didn’t publicly push as hard for Bolton’s prosecution in recent weeks – he generally seemed more content to let the process play out and say relatively little, compared to James and Comey – there is no question he has targeted Bolton for retribution.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Trump has explicitly accused Bolton of crimes and suggested he should be prosecuted, which isn’t what presidents are supposed to do.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton said Thursday that Trump’s calls for retribution against him “became one of his rallying cries in his reelection campaign.”\n \n\n   \n  For another, Trump has singled Bolton out for punishment in other ways, including stripping him of his  security clearance  and even canceling his  security detail , despite Bolton having faced an alleged assassination threat from Iran.\n \n\n   \n  And Bolton’s name also appeared on now-FBI Director Kash Patel’s list of “deep state” members in his 2023 book – a list critics have labeled an “enemies list.” Indeed, two people on that list have now been indicted (Bolton and Comey), and others have faced investigations even at this early juncture in Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other prominent DOJ officials also  made a show of publicizing the Bolton search  back in August, in ways that are not normal.\n \n\n   \n  “NO ONE is above the law…  @FBI  agents on mission,” Patel posted around 7 a.m., right around the time the search was conducted.\n \n\n   \n  All of these data points suggest the politicization of this matter, whether or not the charges are ultimately warranted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/southern-command-caribbean-strikes-holsey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00Z","title":"Commander Overseeing U.S. Forces in the Caribbean to Retire One Year into Tenure","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Admiral Alvin Holsey, who assumed command of U.S. Southern Command in November 2024, is retiring at the end of 2025, one year into his tenure.

      4:10 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean, where the US has carried out multiple legally ambiguous strikes against alleged drug cartels, is retiring one year into his tenure, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media post on X on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The news comes  just days  after the US military conducted its fifth known strike on a boat alleged to be trafficking drugs off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It also comes one day after President Donald Trump said publicly that he had  authorized the CIA  to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flow of drugs and migrants. Also on Wednesday, US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions had been simmering between Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean, and he complained about not being given the information he needed about the operations, the sources said. But SOUTHCOM was concerned about the operations not being lawful, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  The tensions came to a head during a meeting between Hegseth, Holsey and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine on October 6 at the Pentagon, one of the sources said. Holsey offered to resign during the meeting, the source said, but the idea was tabled and his departure was not announced until over a week later. His departure will also not be imminent — instead, he’ll retire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon’s spokesperson Sean Parnell denied on X that Holsey ever expressed reservations about the counter-narcotic mission in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey confirmed in a statement on X that on December 12, 2025, “I will retire from the US Navy.”\n \n\n   \n  “Serving as your commander and deputy for the past 34 months has been a tremendous honor,” Holsey wrote. “The SOUTHCOM team has made lasting contributions to the defense of our nation and will continue to do so. I am confident that you will forge ahead, focused on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures its longevity as a beacon of freedom around the globe.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the US Navy nor Southern Command have responded to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey was sworn in as the commander of Southern Command in November 2024. Holsey’s predecessor, Army Gen. Laura Richardson, served as the Southern Command commander from 2021 to 2025 before retiring.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey has served in uniform for 37 years since commissioning from the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps in 1988, according to his official Navy biography. His previous assignments have included commander of the Navy’s Carrier Strike Group One, an operations officer in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and most recently as the Military Deputy Commander at Southern Command.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of the Department of War, we extend our deepest gratitude to Admiral Alvin Holsey for his more than 37 years of distinguished service to our nation as he plans to retire at year’s end,” Hegseth said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth has replaced a number of senior officers across the military since taking over as Secretary this year, including by firing former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown; Adm. Lisa Franchetti, former Chief of Naval Operations; Gen. James Slife, former vice chief of staff of the Air Force; and Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, former head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect Holsey’s current rank. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/15/us/airport-cyber-breach-pennsylvania-canada-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"03:21:00-04:00","title":"Apparent hackers take over PA systems at 4 North American airports","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Unauthorized political messages praising Hamas and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were broadcast through public address systems at four North American airports—Harrisburg (PA), Kelowna (BC), Victoria (BC), and Windsor (ON)—on October 17, 2025.

unacceptable and understandably scared travelers,” US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on  social media , adding the FAA is working with the Harrisburg airport “to help get to the bottom of this hack.”\n \n\n   \n  The breaches come as the air travel industry has been dealing with an onslaught of cyberattacks that have caused disruptions for customers and ground some of the world’s largest airports to a halt. In June, a notorious cybercriminal group  breached the computer networks  of multiple airlines in the US and Canada, according to the FBI. And last month,  hackers knocked out  a passenger check-in system, causing long delays, cancellations and chaos at airports across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  At the Harrisburg airport Tuesday, “an unauthorized user gained access to the airport PA system and played an unauthorized recorded message,” airport spokesperson Scott Miller told  CNN affiliate WGAL .\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Glen Brown said at first he was confused at what he was hearing, but then he started worrying about what else could be going on.\n \n\n   \n  “You had to do a double-take and ask yourself if what you were hearing was actually real,” he said. “The real question I have is, if they hack the paging system in an international airport, what else are they tunneling into?\n \n\n   \n  “The message was political in nature and did not contain any threats against the airport, our tenants, airlines, or passengers.

Everyone was just really confused.”\n \n\n   \n  Messages praising Hamas in its war with Israel were also broadcast on screens inside Kelowna airport, according to multiple photos shared on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Kelowna airport officials said the unauthorized messages were removed and flight display systems restored, adding efforts to fully restore the PA system were ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  At Victoria International Airport, “an unauthorized audio message” was also broadcast over the public address system due to “a cloud-based software issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank our passengers for their patience and cooperation,” the airport said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  At Windsor International Airport, the terminal was nearly empty because there were no flights immediately arriving or departing, airport President Mark Galvin said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our team responded quickly, removed the images and shut off the recorded PA announcement,” he said. “We returned to normal shortly thereafter and have been operating without incident.”\n \n\n   \n  Transport Canada tells CNN it is “working closely with federal security partners, including law enforcement, to ensure there were no impacts on the safety and security of airport operations, and to mitigate disruption from similar incidents in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for more information.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with further details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/india/india-us-trump-russia-oil-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Claims India Agreed to Stop Buying Russian Oil; India Denies It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to halt India’s purchases of Russian oil, a claim India strongly denies, asserting no such conversation occurred and that it remains a major energy importer.

New Delhi says it knows nothing about it \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:22 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   India  has seemingly pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s claim it had agreed to stop importing Russian oil, signaling the issue that has strained ties is unlikely to be resolved soon.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Wednesday said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “assured me today that they (India) will not be buying oil from Russia,” which is subject to US sanctions, describing it as a “big step.”\n \n\n   \n  But on Thursday India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters he was “not aware of any conversation” between Trump and Modi, or any assurance from the Indian leader that he would stop purchasing Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the day, India’s foreign ministry said the country was a “significant importer of oil and gas,” without naming Russia nor referencing Modi’s purported assurance.\n \n\n   \n  “Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy. This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  India has long maintained close ties with the Kremlin and is due to host Russian President Vladimir Putin later this year. It has emerged as one of the top buyers of Russian oil since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The war sparked massive sanctions against Moscow’s oil industry and sent prices cratering.\n \n\n   \n  For months, New Delhi has resisted Trump’s calls  to cease purchasing Russian oil,  saying it would not bend over the energy needs of its booming economy and growing population, now at more than 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Trump announced an additional 25% tariff on India as a penalty for importing Russian oil and gas, building on a previously announced 25% tariff rate.\n \n\n   \n  It would be almost impossible for India to suddenly halt purchases of crude from Russia, its largest supplier, said Muyu Xu, a senior oil analyst at trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n \n\n   \n  Russia delivered roughly 1.7–1.8 million barrels per day, according to Xu, who cited figures covering the first nine months of this year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think India can stop buying Russian oil overnight. The volumes are simply too large,” she told CNN. “Replacing that volume from the spot market is no easy task. Beyond the sheer quantity, differences in crude quality and refinery yields make substitution far from a one for one swap.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from Kpler shows state-owned refiners trimmed back Russian purchases in recent months, while some private players increased their intake of Russian barrels.\n \n\n   \n  The state-owned Indian Oil Corporation Limited purchased 10.35 million barrels of Russian oil in January compared to 4.62 million barrels in September, data from Kpler shows. So far in October, Indian Oil Corporation Limited purchased 7.03 million barrels, the data showed.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has contacted Indian Oil Corporation Limited to ask if it plans to continue purchasing Russian oil and the factors guiding their strategy of sourcing from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Modi’s refusal to kowtow to US pressure plays to his political brand built around the image of a strong leader helming an India that is focused on its own interests on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, officials from New Delhi and Washington have focused on diplomacy to get the relationship back on track, with trade delegations focusing on closing a deal.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar acknowledged that India “has issues with the United States,” attributing a significant portion of the friction to unresolved trade negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that the two countries “have not arrived at a landing ground for our trade discussions,” but said that India is actively working to find a solution.\n \n\n   \n  “Those issues need to be negotiated and discussed and resolved, which is exactly what we are trying to do,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/dave-taylor-symbol-american-flag","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"12:44:00-04:00","title":"GOP Lawmaker Claims Republican Offices Targeted with 'Vile' Symbol on American Flags","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican Representative Dave Taylor of Ohio claims that his office and others in the Republican Party have been targeted with American flags altered to include a 'vile' symbol, which may be a swastika.

Donald Trump’s former national security adviser-turned-adversary,  was indicted by a federal grand jury  in Maryland on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton, the  third high-profile Trump political enemy  to be indicted in less than a month, now faces eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information.\n \n\n   \n  Essentially, prosecutors say, Bolton kept — and shared with family members — digital diaries of his activities that included all kinds of classified material from when he was national security adviser.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, Bolton shared “more than a thousand pages” of “diary-like entries” “that contained information classified up to the TOP SECRET” level.\n \n\n   \n  The charges unveiled Thursday are the result of a criminal investigation that began in 2022 after Bolton’s emails were hacked by Iran.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton is expected to surrender himself, as soon as Friday, to authorities at federal court in Greenbelt, but a hearing has not been scheduled.\n \n\n   \n    What are the allegations?\n \n\n   \n  Bolton would allegedly take handwritten notes from his day at the White House and other secure locations then rewrite them on his computer. Those entries, prosecutors say, were printed and remained on personal devices used by Bolton and others in his home.\n \n\n   \n  “Bolton used his personal non-governmental email accounts, such as email accounts hosted by AOL and Google, to email information classified” to the individual’s personal email accounts, the indictment states.\n \n\n   \n  “Often, Bolton’s notes described the secure setting or environment in which he learned the national defense and classified information that he was memorializing in his notes,” prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The purpose Bolton stated of creating a group chat in which he would later share his notes taken during his work as a national security adviser, the indictment says, was “For Diary in the future!!!”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI’s investigation revealed that John Bolton allegedly transmitted top secret information using personal online accounts and retained said documents in his house in direct violation of federal law,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors made use of Bolton’s voluminous media commentary on the sharing of classified information and use of encrypted chats to make the case that the former national security adviser has a strong “understanding of how to properly handle classified information and the potential consequences of failing to do so,” according to the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  In one criticism of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time leading the State Department – cited by the indictment – Bolton said in 2017, a year prior to his service under Trump, “if I had done at the State Department what [senior U.S. Government official] did, I’d be [imprisoned] right now.”\n \n\n   \n    Bolton says he’s a victim of Trump’s DOJ\n \n\n   \n  Bolton issued a statement Thursday night saying he has become Trump’s latest target in the weaponization of his Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  He said that his book, “The Room Where It Happened,” was reviewed and approved by “the appropriate, experienced career clearance officials” and that the FBI was made fully aware of his email hack in 2021. In the four years of the Biden administration, Bolton said, no charges were filed against him.\n \n\n   \n  “Then came Trump 2 who embodies what Joseph Stalin’s head of secret police once said, ‘You show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime,’” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  “These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” he added. “Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America’s constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom. I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, was at the White House, doing a press event on  IVF drug prices  when the indictment was handed up.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s, you know, a bad person. I think he’s a bad guy,” Trump said when told of the indictment. “Yeah, he’s a bad guy, too bad, but that’s the way it goes, right?”\n \n\n   \n    Investigation began during Biden years\n \n\n   \n  While the first Trump Justice Department had initially sought to block Bolton’s 2020 memoir and investigated whether Bolton violated the law by including information the administration said was classified, that case was closed in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an Iran hack investigation started in 2021 under Biden that brought things to the current point.\n \n\n   \n  For prosecutors and FBI investigators, part of their effort has focused on keeping the case out of the roiling politics looming over the Justice Department as Trump has publicly pushed for the prosecution of his political enemies, which includes Bolton.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike prosecutions brought against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the Bolton case has maintained the support of career prosecutors and investigators, people briefed on the matter said.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next for Bolton?\n \n\n   \n  The charges — if proven — are possibly more serious than those in other high-profile investigations into the mishandling of classified material, such as those related to Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence, Joe Biden and Trump, said CNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Bolton is alleged to have “actively disseminated” classified information of the “highest level” to family members who had no security clearance. And when Bolton’s email was hacked by Iran, he allegedly omitted that he had been using the email account to share such information.\n \n\n   \n  “If DOJ can prove this, this is big, big trouble for John Bolton,” Honig said.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been assigned to US District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama in 2014.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Donald Judd and Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/susan-stamberg-death-npr-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:51:00-04:00","title":"Susan Stamberg, first woman to host a national news program, dies at age 87","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Susan Stamberg, a pioneering female broadcaster and one of the founding figures of National Public Radio (NPR), died at age 87.

\nUpdated: \n        11:51 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Susan Stamberg, a “founding mother” of  National Public Radio  and the first female broadcaster to host a national news program, has died. She was 87.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg died Thursday, NPR reported. It did not provide a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg joined NPR in the early 1970s when it was getting off the ground as a network of radio stations across the country. During her career, she interviewed thousands of people, from prominent politicians and artists to the less well-known like White House chefs and people who work behind the scenes in Hollywood.\n \n\n   \n  She explained in an oral history interview with Oregon station KLCC in January that she didn’t have women in broadcast to model herself after when she became the host of “All Things Considered” in 1972.\n \n\n   \n  “The only ones on were men, and the only thing I knew to do was imitate them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She lowered her voice to sound authoritative. After a few days, Bill Siemering, the program manager, told her to be herself.\n \n\n   \n  “And that was new too in its day, because everybody else, the women, were trained actors, and so they came with a very careful accents and very careful delivery. They weren’t relaxed and natural,” she said. “So we made a new sound with radio as well, with NPR.”\n \n\n   \n   NPR’s obituary for Stamberg  quoted her colleague Jack Mitchell saying she had an “obvious New York accent.”\n \n\n   \n  “All Things Considered” only had five reporters to draw on while they filled their 90-minute program, creating a daily challenge.\n \n\n   \n  She told KLCC that she coined the term “founding mother” to refer to herself and three other women who helped launch the NPR: Cokie Roberts, Nina Totenberg and Linda Wertheimer.\n \n\n   \n  “I got tired of hearing about Founding Fathers, and I knew we were not that, so we were obviously Founding Mothers, and I was going to put that on the map,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg hosted “All Things Considered” for 14 years. She went on to host “Weekend Edition Sunday,” where she started the Sunday puzzle feature with Will Shortz.\n \n\n   \n  Shortz, who continues to serve as the program’s puzzle master and who is now the crossword editor of the New York Times, explained that Stamberg wanted the show to be the radio equivalent of a Sunday newspaper that provided news, culture, sports and a puzzle.\n \n\n   \n  She later became a cultural correspondent for “Morning Edition” and “Weekend Edition Saturday.” She retired in September.\n \n\n   \n  In 1979, she hosted a two-hour radio call-in program with then-President Jimmy Carter from the Oval Office. She managed the listeners who called in to speak with him. The questions were not screened beforehand. It was the second time Carter had a call-in program after the first with Walter Cronkite.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, which said she was known for her “conversational style, intelligence, and knack for finding an interesting story.” She interviewed Nancy Reagan, Annie Liebowitz, Rosa Parks and James Baldwin, among thousands of others.\n \n\n   \n  She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg was born Susan Levitt in Newark, New Jersey, in 1938 but grew up in Manhattan. She met her husband, Louis Stamberg, while working in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  She is survived by her son, Josh Stamberg, and her granddaughters, Vivian and Lena.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/europe/us-russia-budapest-talks-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:03:00-04:00","title":"Will Putin’s call lure Trump closer to the Kremlin?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a strategically timed phone call, Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged in a nearly two-and-a-half-hour dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump to prevent the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.

seems to have timed its latest,  lengthy phone call  with the White House – the eighth in the past eight months – to perfection.\n \n\n   \n  With US President Donald Trump poised to meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, and publicly weighing the risks of supplying Kyiv with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, Russian officials described the call they initiated as “positive and productive,” and “held in an atmosphere of trust.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, it was a nearly two-and-a-half-hour intervention by President Vladimir Putin – a last-minute bid to halt in its tracks all that dangerous talk of potentially game-changing US weapons supplies to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield, Putin is said to have stressed on the Trump call. They would just damage the US-Russian relationship, he added, which he knows Trump values so highly.\n \n\n   \n  According to one Kremlin aide, Putin also praised Trump as a peacemaker in the Middle East and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Economic deals were again dangled, and – crucially – there was an agreement for a second face-to-face presidential summit, this time in Budapest, Hungary, where ending the Ukraine war could once more be discussed, if not agreed.\n \n\n   \n  That will raise inevitable comparisons with the failed  Alaska summit  just a few months ago, when Trump gave Putin a red-carpet reception but secured no tangible results in his push for a Ukraine peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  But now, flushed with his achievements in  brokering a ceasefire in Gaza , and the release of Israeli hostages, Trump has suggested that his success in the Middle East, against the odds, will help end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  How remains unclear. The Kremlin has offered no suggestion that it is prepared to compromise. Despite mounting battlefield casualties and increasing Ukrainian drone attacks on its energy infrastructure, causing fuel shortages across the country, Russia has consistently ruled out ending the war in Ukraine until it has achieved its maximalist objectives.\n \n\n   \n  These include gaining control over vast swathes of annexed Ukrainian territory not yet conquered, and imposing strict military and foreign policy limits on a postwar Ukraine that would essentially subjugate Kyiv to Moscow’s will.\n \n\n   \n  Nothing in the latest Trump-Putin phone call suggested any of this had changed.\n \n\n   \n  But over the past nine months of this second Trump administration, the Kremlin has also learned that offering personal engagement, and holding out the possibility of a short-term win, can be just as effective as any painful compromise.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian officials, gathering in Washington, say it is the discussion of Tomahawks that forced Putin back into dialogue.\n \n\n   \n  That may be true. But the calculation here in Moscow is that the mere prospect of progress on peace talks may be enough to lure Trump, hungry for a deal, into dropping his military threats.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/trump-ivf-emd-serono-trumprx-drug-price","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-04:00","title":"White House Announces IVF Drug Pricing Deal for ‘TrumpRx’ Site","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced a major initiative to reduce the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs through a new platform called TrumpRx, which will launch in January 2026.

Katie Britt,   Trump also previewed a plan to spur employers to offer more IVF coverage to their employees.\n \n\n   \n  The actions come approximately eight months after Trump’s promise, in a February executive order, to  expand access to IVF  and reduce its cost.\n \n\n   \n   Pfizer  and  AstraZeneca  also signed   agreements in recent weeks with the administration to offer drugs on TrumpRx as part of multipart deals earning reprieves from higher tariffs on imported products.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, the EMD Serono deal would include a reprieve from certain tariffs in exchange for manufacturing and research investment in the US. “We are committed to working with the US administration to add value over the long term, ensuring that our patients and customers continue to have access to and benefit from the innovations within our portfolio,” Belén Garijo, the Merck KGaA CEO, said.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials also noted in a call with reporters that the manufacturer is interested in bringing another fertility medicine to the US market, and could get a speedier review from the Food and Drug Administration as a result of the drug pricing deal.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he is encouraging employers to improve IVF access through health insurance plans that offer elective add-on insurance—akin to vision or dental plans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no deeper happiness and joy of raising children, and now millions of Americans struggling with infertility will have a new chance to share the greatest experience of them all,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, employers are not being compelled to offer IVF coverage, nor will there be a requirement for government or insurance company coverage.\n \n\n   \n  The insurance announcement falls well short of a campaign promise Trump made to ensure universal free IVF coverage for those seeking it. “Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” he told supporters at a campaign stop last August.\n \n\n   \n  IVF involves costs beyond drugs and can average between $20,000 and $30,000 per treatment   cycle.  Nearly half of companies  with 500 or more employees covered IVF in their broadest health care plans in 2024, according to a Mercer survey— more than double the number of similar-sized companies that covered IVF in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  However,   smaller companies—those with fewer than 500 employees—are far less likely to offer the benefit,  according to data  from health research nonprofit KFF.\n \n\n   \n  An administration official said they expect employers will want to add on IVF   benefits being proposed by the White House   because it will make them “competitive for talent.”\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 60% of women aged 30 to 44 get their health insurance through their employer, “making this the greatest possible expansion opportunity from a federal action probably ever,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    Limits to Trump’s IVF plans\n \n\n   \n  In response to the announcement, some reproductive medicine doctors and advocates questioned how extensive new insurance coverage would be and what the impact would be on other widely used fertility drugs.\n \n\n   \n  “Fertility care, including IVF, is health care,” said Dr. Serena Chen, director of advocacy at CCRM Fertility IRMS Reproductive Medicine in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to hear a federal mandate for insurance coverage” for IVF, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chen was cautiously hopeful about the White House’s promised 84% discount on the three fertility drugs from EMD Serono, noting the company is one of three major makers of commonly used fertility medicines.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously that’s a massive discount, so that I do think is super exciting,” she said. However, she noted that two other companies, Organon and Ferring, are also key makers of these drugs. “What about the other two companies?”\n \n\n   \n  Organon and Ferring did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the other companies in the market make some — but not necessarily all three — of the fertility medicines used in the IVF process, said Dr. David Sable, a former reproductive endocrinologist and current biosciences fund manager. That could make EMD Serono’s agreement with the Trump administration, to offer a heavy discount on their three products together, hard to rival, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet other moves by the Trump administration could hurt families’ access to successful IVF procedures, Sable has argued. In particular, layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this April eliminated a  six-person team  that tracks assisted fertility procedures and potential factors in successful pregnancies.\n \n\n   \n  “If you mandate coverage or make IVF free tomorrow, you need an infrastructure and an ecosystem that actually can take care of all these patients,” Sable said. “We need innovation, we need automation, we need risk management.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/us-strikes-suspected-drug-boat-survivors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-04:00","title":"Some survivors after US strikes another suspected drug boat in the Caribbean, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 16, 2025, the US conducted a strike in the Caribbean on a suspected drug-laden boat, resulting in survivors — a first among previous strikes that were fatal.

from the first general election debate in the NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:02 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Zohran Mamdani was pushed to provide specifics about his plans if he’s elected mayor of New York City in the campaign’s first fall debate, hammered by his two older rivals who painted him as unprepared and accused him of selling the city’s residents a fantasy.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the two hours on stage centered on Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist and clear front-runner in the polls. But there were so many back-and-forths that Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, started an answer just 15 minutes into the event by saying: “First of all, there’s high levels of testosterone in this room.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani didn’t answer exactly how he would afford his signature policies of  freezing increases on rent-controlled apartments  and making buses free, or how to square  past comments on the police  that he says don’t represent his current views. And he notably declined to back the reelection bid of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul,  one of the few major Democrats  in the state to endorse him.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent  after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary , said Mamdani’s “whole plan is based on a myth” of believing that Albany would pass new taxes to enable his plans. Sliwa called his ideas “fantasies.” But Cuomo had his own struggles to explain what new ideas he would bring to City Hall or the questions about  sexual harassment  and  his handling of Covid-19 in nursing homes  that followed him when he resigned as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity,” Mamdani told Cuomo early on. “What you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.”\n \n\n   \n  Here are CNN’s main takeaways from the debate.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo says if Mamdani wins, NYC’s leader would be ‘Mayor Donald Trump’\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Cuomo traded familiar barbs about the Queens native in the White House. But Cuomo debuted a new line to reflect his belief that President Donald Trump would overpower Mamdani and undermine his authority.\n \n\n   \n  “If the assemblyman is elected, Mayor Donald Trump will take over in New York City, and it will be Mayor Trump,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani responded by accusing Cuomo of being a “coward.” He noted Cuomo  failed to mention Trump  in a statement he issued condemning the Department of Justice’s indictment of State Attorney General Letitia James.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa were all asked the last time they spoke with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo said he spoke with the president after an assassination attempt last year and again denied a New York Times report that the two had recently spoken about the mayoral race. Sliwa said he hadn’t spoken with Trump in years, saying he had last spoken with Trump years ago about the Veterans Day parade.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if he had ever spoken with Trump, Mamdani answered with a curt “no.” (He did  turn to a Fox News camera  Wednesday to deliver a message directly to Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani was asked what he would say to Trump in a hypothetical first call if elected mayor. He said he would be willing to speak and work with the president as long as it was focused on issues of affordability.\n \n\n   \n   “I would make it clear to the president that I am willing to not only speak to him, but to work with him if it means delivering on lowering the cost of living for New York,” Mamdani said. “That’s something that he ran his presidential campaign on, and yet, all he’s been able to deliver thus far.”\n \n\n   \n    Israel and Gaza\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming a Democratic sensation and as  the party’s politics have broadly shifted against the Israeli government  during the war in Gaza, Mamdani has proactively repeated the opposition to Israel he expressed consistently from college through his time as an assemblyman.\n \n\n   \n  On the debate stage, Mamdani spoke of  the conversations he has had with Jewish New Yorkers  since becoming the Democratic nominee that have opened his eyes to the existence of antisemitism in ways he said he hadn’t fully realized existed and how the phrase “globalize the intifada” could be hurtful. He wouldn’t say whether he believes Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state, saying only that he does not support any country that exists with racial or religious hierarchies.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani also backtracked on an answer he gave just Wednesday on Fox News. Pressed then about whether he would call for Hamas to lay down their weapons, as is called for in the ceasefire agreement, Mamdani said he didn’t have an opinion on the matter beyond following international law. On the debate stage, he did have an opinion: “Of course I believe that they should lay down their arms.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani didn’t respond when Cuomo tried to make a moment of calling on him to denounce Hamas explicitly. He said while he hopes the ceasefire will hold, he will not stop denouncing “the siege, the occupation, and apartheid.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo leapt on that answer, arguing that “the occupation” is a reference to Israel existing at all on the land and saying it’s equivalent to the Hamas-promoted slogan that a future Palestinian state should be “from the river to the sea.” Mamdani rejected that interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani in turn accused Cuomo of fanning anti-Muslim sentiment, arguing that Cuomo never visited a mosque until after losing the primary to him.\n \n\n   \n  “What Muslims want in this city is what every community wants and deserves,” he said. “They want equality and they want respect.”\n \n\n   \n    The forgotten Republican tries to make a mark\n \n\n   \n  The Republican nominee came out swinging.\n \n\n   \n  Free of his  signature red beret , Sliwa leaned into the center-stage spot given to him to go after both of his opponents. He sought to separate himself from the political establishment, at one point countering a question about his lack of political experience by saying, “Thank God I am not a politician.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, best known as the founder of the crime watch group Guardian Angels, focused many of his attacks on Cuomo, questioning his toughness and at one point invoking his father with a particularly sharp zinger.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa alleged that the state parole board when Cuomo was governor released people accused of killing police officers.\n \n\n   \n  “Your father, when he was governor, released none. I knew Mario Cuomo; you’re no Mario Cuomo,” Sliwa said.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa is hoping to appeal not just to Republicans but also moderate Democrats unwilling to support Cuomo or Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  He has repeatedly refused to leave the race as incumbent Mayor Eric Adams did, even as Cuomo allies argue Sliwa staying in the race helps Mamdani. Trump has refused to endorse Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa called Mamdani’s ideas “fantasies.” Mamdani generally ignored Sliwa, other than repeatedly correcting the Republican’s mispronunciations of his first name.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani did snap at Sliwa when the Republican told him that “Jews don’t trust that you are going to be there for them when they’re subject to antisemitic attacks.”\n \n\n   \n  “I will be a mayor who finally addresses that, not just the theatrics on this stage,” Mamdani retorted.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani again apologizes for ripping the police as racist\n \n\n   \n  Since winning June’s Democratic primary, Mamdani  has distanced himself  from tweets referring to police officers as “racist” and “wicked,” though he has a long history of being critical of law enforcement. He’s also  met with police officers and won a notable endorsement  from a former high-ranking New York Police Department official.\n \n\n   \n  He reiterated his apology Thursday to New York Police Department officers but also mentioned the names of Black men who have died in police encounters, including the five young men of color who were wrongfully accused and convicted in the Central Park jogger case in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has tried to draw a contrast between him and Mamdani by proposing to increase the police officer headcount, casting himself as a tough on crime candidate and suggesting Mamdani would be soft.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has proposed creating a Department of Community Safety which would in part dispatch social workers to calls involving people in mental health crises instead of solely relying on police officers.\n \n\n   \n  “He wants to use social workers on domestic violence calls, which are very dangerous, and he’s told you what he thinks,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n    A brewing fight over taxes on millionaires – and a notable non-endorsement\n \n\n   \n  There was a wide range of subjects discussed Thursday that will confront the city’s next mayor, everything from noise complaints to the city’s public school system, the largest in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani said he would be in favor of changing mayoral control over the school system, a surprising position considering it could limit his authority. Mayoral control allows the mayor near-complete authority over the city’s public school system, centralizing the power with the executive which is in turn seen as being directly accountable for the how the system performs.\n \n\n   \n   Mamdani said he would not give up control in full, saying he wants a participatory system that gives parents and educators increased influence.\n \n\n   \n  He also doubled down on his plan to raise taxes the city’s wealthiest residents despite Hochul’s opposition, saying he believed the same energy that buoyed his underdog campaign would create support for his push to increase taxes.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people called even my campaign a nonstarter when we first began,” Mamdani said. “Now I stand before you proud to be the Democratic nominee who got the most votes in city primary history, and I believe we will see the same thing with our push to ensure that we are taxing the wealthiest and the most profitable corporations the fair amount that they should pay.”\n \n\n   \n  As mayor, Mamdani would not have the power to raise taxes on his own. He would need the approval of the state legislature and for the governor to sign off on the increase – a politically difficult proposition for any executive, particularly in an election year, which Hochul will be facing next year.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Mamdani declined to endorse Hochul for reelection, saying he was focused on winning the mayoral race, even as Hochul  became one of the first major New York Democrats  to endorse him for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m focusing on November, and I appreciate her support, and I appreciate her work,” Mamdani said when pressed by a moderator.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/chicago-car-ramming-case-ice-protests","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00-05:00","title":"Federal Vehicle Moved 1,000 Miles After Chicago Car Ramming Case Sparks Legal and Public Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, is accused of ramming a federal law enforcement vehicle in Chicago on October 4, 2025, during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

She was treated at a hospital and released into FBI custody.\n \n\n   \n  While the Thursday hearing was intended to set a trial date for Martinez, the focus quickly turned to the vehicles at the center of the case, which could be used as critical evidence at trial.\n \n\n   \n  “The cars are the big issue,” Parente said in court.\n \n\n   \n  But the federal vehicle has since been driven to Maine, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Bond said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente, who was visibly upset, accused the DOJ of moving the car, despite knowing he would likely need to examine the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  After Bond said no arrangements had been made to bring the car back to Chicago, the judge ordered the car to be returned.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you need to get the car back,”   US District Court Judge Georgia Alexakis said. “It’s a reasonable request. There’s only so much you can tell from photos.”\n \n\n   \n  Parente also expressed concern evidence would not be preserved after the car had been driven to Maine and back. Alexakis agreed and ordered the car to be moved using a flatbed truck.\n \n\n   \n  Another hearing will be held Monday to set a trial date. If convicted at trial, Martinez could face up to twenty years in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to Bond.\n \n\n   \n  The other driver, 21-year-old Ruiz, was indicted on the same charge as Martinez and has pleaded not guilty. Authorities say both Ruiz and Martinez boxed in and struck the federal vehicle.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/entertainment/ace-frehley-kiss-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"10:49:00-04:00","title":"Ace Frehley, Kiss’ original lead guitarist and founding member, dies at 74","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, died at 74 in Morristown, New Jersey.

\n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:49 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, who captivated audiences with his elaborate galactic makeup and smoking guitar, died Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  He was 74.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall, according to his agent.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said in a statement that they are “completely devastated and heartbroken” but will cherish his laughter and celebrate the kindness he bestowed upon others.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss, whose hits included “Rock and Roll All Nite” and “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” was known for its theatrical stage shows, with fire and fake blood spewing from the mouths of band members dressed in body armor, platform boots, wigs and signature black-and-white face paint.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss’ original lineup included Frehley, singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, tongue-wagging bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss. Frehley’s is the first death among the four founding members.\n \n\n   \n  Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters – Frehley was known as “Space Ace” and the “Spaceman.” The New York-born entertainer and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.\n \n\n   \n  “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley,” Simmons and Stanley said in a joint statement. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS’s legacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Born Paul Daniel Frehley, he grew up in a musical family and began playing guitar at age 13. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss was especially popular in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to become a marketing marvel. “Beth” was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.\n \n\n   \n  As the Kennedy Center’s new chairman, President Donald Trump named Kiss as one of  this year’s honorees .\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the band sold their catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be over $300 million.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years. He left the band in 1982, missing the years when they took off the makeup and had mixed success. Stanley later said they nearly replaced Frehley with Eddie Van Halen, but Vinnie Vincent assumed the lead guitar role.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley’s Comet.\n \n\n   \n  But he rejoined Kiss in the mid-1990s for a triumphant reunion and restoration of their original style that came after bands including Nirvana, Weezer and the Melvins had expressed affection for the band and paid them musical tributes.\n \n\n   \n  He would leave again in 2002. When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.\n \n\n   \n  Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss “no longer deserve to wear the paint.” “The makeup is earned,” he added. “Just being there at the beginning is not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands including Mötley Crüe and Poison.\n \n\n   \n  “Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we’ve done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,” Poison front man  Bret Michaels  said on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  Harder-edged bands like Metallica and Pantera were also fans, and even country superstar Garth Brooks joined the band members for a recording of their “Hard Luck Woman” on a 1994 compilation.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley would appear occasionally with Kiss for shows in later years. A 2023 concert at Madison Square Garden was  billed as the band’s last.  While Stanley and Simmons said they would not tour again, they’ve been open to the possibility of more concerts, and they’ve stayed active promoting the group’s music and memorabilia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/virginia-attorney-general-debate-jay-jones-jason-miyares","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"19:48:00-04:00","title":"Jay Jones’ Violent Text Messages Take Center Stage in Virginia AG Race Debate Against Jason Miyares","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia Attorney General, has faced intense scrutiny over graphic and violent text messages from 2022 in which he suggested that then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his wife should be shot, and that their children should die.

center stage in Virginia AG race debate against Jason Miyares \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:48 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia attorney general, expressed his regret for the graphic and violent language directed at a colleague  in text messages  in his opening statement in Thursday night’s debate with Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be very clear: I am ashamed. I am embarrassed. And I am sorry,” Jones said. “I am sorry to Speaker Gilbert. I am sorry to his family. I am sorry to my family. And I am sorry to every single Virginian. I cannot take back what I said, but you have my word that I will always be accountable for my mistakes. And you also have my word that I will spend every waking moment fighting for you.”\n \n\n   \n  The debate came less than two weeks after the attorney general’s race was turned on its head by the publication of the 2022 text messages in which Jones, then a state legislator, suggested then- House Speaker Todd Gilbert, a Republican, should be shot. He went on to say Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists,” in reference to Gilbert’s young children and suggested the children should die. National Review  first reported  the news of Jones’ texts, which were sent to a Republican lawmaker, Carrie Coyner.\n \n\n   \n  Jones’ comments happened moments after Miyares recounted the contents of those text messages, and said they reveal Jones does not have the “experience or the judgment” to be the state’s top prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  “We have seen a window to who Jay Jones is and the way he thinks of people that disagree with him,” Miyares said. “Abraham Lincoln said the character is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he was doing in the dark.”\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the debate, Miyares kept a relentless focus on Jones’ text messages — repeatedly invoking their contents to cast doubt on whether he could prosecute crimes against children, deal with parents whose children have died and more.\n \n\n   \n  “Jay, if you were really sorry, then you wouldn’t be running,” Miyares said during the debate.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, meanwhile, sought to redirect the conversation to President Donald Trump, arguing that Miyares couldn’t be trusted to defend Virginians’ interests by taking on the Trump administration in court.\n \n\n   \n  “It is no surprise that President Trump has endorsed Jason for this race — the only statewide elected official to receive that endorsement,” Jones said. “Threw his arm around him and said, ‘He will never let you down.’ And when he says ‘you’ he means Donald Trump, because Donald Trump has spent the last 10 years telling us that he only cares about himself.”\n \n\n   \n  Early voting is already underway. Under Virginia law, there is no way for Jones to formally exit the race at this point without Democrats effectively conceding the attorney general’s office.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic nominee for governor, Abigail Spanberger, has denounced Jones’ texts — but has left his political fate up to voters. She did not repeat her previous endorsement of Jones in her  recent debate  with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, but she also did not call for Jones to end his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Jones’ texts have become a national story that has dominated headlines ahead of an election in Virginia that is often seen as a barometer of the political mood a year after each presidential election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Thursday said Jones “has appropriately apologized” for his texts and said his remarks have been “condemned across the board by the Democrats” in Virginia and beyond. He did not say whether Jones should stay in the race or not.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Democratic Party chairman Lamont Bagby, who is a state senator, has defended Jones.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve known Jay Jones for years, and I know his family. I know him as a man, and those texts aren’t who he is. And at this point in the commonwealth’s history, we need somebody that’s going to stand up and fight for Virginia’s health care, education and make sure that we stand up for democracy,” Bagby said.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, the son of a Cuban immigrant, could represent Republicans’ best chance of a statewide victory in Virginia this fall. He won the attorney general’s office in 2021, ousting Democratic incumbent Mark Herring — a year in which Jones lost the Democratic primary to Herring. Miyares has often waded into cultural battles over gender identity and schools — an issue that Earle-Sears has made the centerpiece of her message this year.\n \n\n   \n  The debate covered a range of issues that have been focal points in Virginia’s elections — including  utility costs , transgender policies, drug prices, fentanyl prosecutions and the  government shutdown  — which has major ramifications in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, where the federal government is a massive employer. But Miyares also peppered his comments with references to Jones’ texts throughout the debate.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, who was also in the Legislature at the time the texts were sent, recalled Gilbert’s wife bringing their two young children to the General Assembly, and the children running through the halls.\n \n\n   \n  “This wasn’t a hypothetical. This wasn’t some figure that you know from far away. You actually know Todd. This is a flesh-and-blood, real husband. Jennifer is a real mom. These are real kids,” Miyares said. “How in the world could you ever show compassion and comfort a grieving mother that has ever lost a child to violence?”\n \n\n   \n  Jones pointed to Republican figures’ own controversial comments.\n \n\n   \n  “What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?” Jones said, referring to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  Jones added: “I have taken accountability for my mistakes. It’s time you take accountability, too.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/illinois-judge-trump-chicago-protesters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00Z","title":"Federal judge demands answers from Trump admin on following order to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, expanded her temporary restraining order against the Trump administration’s use of aggressive tactics by immigration and border enforcement agents in Chicago.

demands answers from Trump admin on following order to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters \n       \n  By Andy Rose, Bill Kirkos, Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:10 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The sign outside the door said Courtroom 1403. But inside, it felt a lot more like the principal’s office.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not happy,” US District Judge Sara Ellis said Thursday in a stern tone no student – or attorney – wants to hear. “I’m really not happy.”\n \n\n   \n  One week after the judge issued a  sweeping order  trying to calm the intense response of federal agents to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Border Patrol activities in Chicago, Ellis told both sides to come back to her courtroom to have their own intense discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “I live in Chicago, if folks haven’t noticed, and I’m not blind, right?” Ellis opened the hearing. “So, I don’t live in a cave. I have a phone. I have a TV. I have a computer and I tend to get news.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge said those news reports were leading her to believe the Trump administration may not be following her instructions.\n \n\n   \n  “At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” said Ellis  from the bench.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Ellis announced Thursday she will expand her restraining order, requiring all federal agents who are part of Operation Midway Blitz and who have body cameras to have them on during encounters with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The judge initially required all agents to wear cameras, but agreed to some flexibility after Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration, said it would be logistically impossible to immediately equip all agents with bodycams.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice still opposed the body cam order, arguing it’s not a simple matter to record the body cam videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.\n \n\n   \n  “It would require a tremendous amount of resources,” Skedzielewski said.\n \n\n   \n    Order limited use of riot control weapons and tactics\n \n\n   \n  Ellis –  an Obama appointee  – issued a temporary restraining order last week after a coalition of local journalists and protesters sued the Trump administration, saying federal law enforcement agents were targeting people engaging in peaceful activity, including multiple reporters who said they had pepper balls fired on them despite being identified as press.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the plaintiffs said they believe agents violated the order, including a  confrontation  on Chicago’s southeast side Tuesday after a traffic accident involving US Border Patrol, which ended with agents using tear gas against an angry crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a reason the Chicago Police Department has policies about car chases and where they occur, and where they need to stop,” said the judge, suggesting the tense situation resulted from Border Patrol agents using tactics not appropriate in the nation’s third-largest city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not on the border. We are in an urban, densely populated area where crowds are going to converge when there’s a commotion, where appropriate crowd control is important,” she said. “Trying to apprehend and detain people is very, very different when you’re in an urban setting than when you’re out on the border.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday at 10:30 a.m. local time, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” It is unclear if Hott will appear in person or via a video link.\n \n\n   \n  The original restraining order from Ellis blocks agents from targeting journalists who are not interfering with law enforcement. Federal agents are also prohibited from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on anyone who does not impose an “immediate threat to safety.”\n \n\n   \n  “The issue is that DHS is using force in a manner that violates the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters, journalists and, essentially, clergy members,” said the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t shoot ‘em in the head (with pepper balls),” Ellis said, addressing a list of things federal agents have been accused of doing in encounters with demonstrators. “You can’t deploy tear gas. You can’t use flash-bang grenades. You can’t drive a car through a crowd.”\n \n\n   \n  Video of a pastor being  repeatedly shot  by pepper balls during a demonstration outside at an ICE facility near Chicago earlier this month drew widespread outcry.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration agents nationally have expressed reluctance about body cameras\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys on both sides of the Chicago case are waiting for details on how the body camera order will work there. The topic has at times led to friction between immigration agents and FBI agents assigned to assist with enforcement efforts across the country, two law enforcement sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  While FBI agents have worn body cameras during joint arrest operations per their agency’s policy, some immigration agents not wearing body cameras expressed concern to their FBI counterparts about having their tactics recorded, sources said. During one heated exchange, immigration agents who did not want to be captured on body camera footage refused to invite FBI agents along for an arrest operation, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN has reported, law enforcement sources said the increasingly aggressive tactics they’ve observed by immigration agents have, at times, led to other confrontations in recent months between the Department of Homeland Security and agents from other federal agencies working on joint task forces.\n \n\n   \n  In at least two FBI field office divisions, sources who were not authorized to speak publicly said agents assigned to work on immigration matters raised concerns with their management over what they believed to be questionable tactics by DHS, such as entering private property without permission and racial profiling.\n \n\n   \n    Government says judge is seeing “selectively edited” reports\n \n\n   \n  Skedzielewski suggested the news coverage that prompted the judge’s anger may be misleading, saying Ellis is relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis acknowledged some details in news reports may be under dispute, adding that is why she wants to speak to the field director on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker – who is not a party to the lawsuit – said Thursday he was pleased by the judge’s decision to expand her order and that agents should be wearing body cameras “because they clearly lie about what goes on.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re going to see more cases brought against ICE and (Customs and Border Protection),” Pritzer added.\n \n\n   \n  Asked recently about tactics used by immigration agents, DHS said  in a statement  to CNN that federal agents are facing “smearing” by claims the agency is using “harsher approaches” and said they “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a loss for the Trump administration, an appellate court on Thursday denied the government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  However, the troops can remain in the state under federal control, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion details the court’s reasoning in a  decision  issued Saturday and comes a week after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a scathing  oral ruling  from Chicago that granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in Illinois for two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/venezuela-maduro-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"18:19:00Z","title":"Trump Administration Focuses Attention on Venezuela and Maduro","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has intensified its pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, using a combination of diplomatic isolation, economic sanctions, and military operations to counter what it describes as an illegitimate and drug-trafficking regime.

\nUpdated: \n        6:19 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tensions are escalating between Washington and Caracas as the Trump administration has increasingly signaled it  could use military means  to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has not explicitly said he is trying to overthrow Maduro. However, it would not be the first time Trump or members of his cabinet have sought to see a change in leadership in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  During his first term, Trump  recognized  Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the president of Venezuela after Maduro was inaugurated for a second term that the US, dozens of other countries, and the Venezuelan opposition had decried as illegitimate.\n \n\n   \n  The January 2019 recognition set off a rapid diplomatic breakdown between Washington and Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, accusing the US of backing a coup, cut diplomatic ties with the administration,  closed  Venezuela’s embassy and all of its consulates in the United States, and issued an ultimatum for US personnel to leave Venezuela. Hours later, the US State Department ordered all of its non-emergency diplomats out of the country. Less than two months later, the US  withdrew  the rest of its diplomats and suspended operations at its embassy in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  The administration imposed a flurry of sanctions on the Maduro regime during the first term. In 2020, Trump’s Justice Department charged Maduro was engaging in “narco-terrorism” and levied a $15 million bounty for the arrest of the Venezuelan leader.\n \n\n   \n  In January 2019, then-national security adviser John Bolton said that “all options” were on the table, including military force.\n \n\n   \n  Now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is seen as the key architect of the Trump administration’s Venezuela policy, has long denounced the Maduro regime and backed the Venezuelan opposition.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2019, during his time as a Florida senator, Rubio called the Maduro government “a transnational criminal group” and said “the crisis” in the country wasn’t “an attempt to bring about ‘regime change’ or interfere in the internal affairs of another country,” but rather about “serious threats to our national security posed by drug trafficking” and Russian and Iranian influence.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro and “his cronies aren’t politicians motivated by the national interests of a country, they are gangsters motivated by a desire to keep their illegal sources of income,” Rubio  posted  on X at the time. “We must consider every option available to us to bring to an end their lucrative criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  More than six years later, much appears the same.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has remained in power, once again claiming victory in an election in 2024 denounced by the international community as illegitimate.\n \n\n   \n  Although there has been limited engagement between Maduro’s and Trump’s governments, formal diplomatic ties remain severed.\n \n\n   \n  However, the threat of military force is far more present. The Trump administration has said its strategy is one of countering narco-trafficking, but some officials have acknowledged that it could also serve as a means to dislodge Maduro from power.\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean and carried out deadly military strikes on at least five alleged drug boats with ties to cartels and criminal organizations the administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has increased the bounty on Maduro to $50 million.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump confirmed he had authorized the CIA to operate inside of Venezuela, but he said it was to counter drug smuggling.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we’re going to stop them by land also,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump believes that Nicholas Maduro is an illegitimate President leading an illegitimate regime that has been trafficking drugs to the United States of America for far too long, and we’re not going to tolerate it,” White House press secretary Karoline Levitt said Thursday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/read-john-bolton-full-indictment","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00Z","title":"Full indictment of John Bolton","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on 18 counts, including eight for transmitting and ten for retaining national defense information.

of Hollywood, dead at 79 \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:37 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Diane Keaton , known for her unique brand of comedic timing and inimitable style, has died. Stars from Goldie Hawn to Bette Midler to Steve Martin expressed their love of the actor after hearing the news, paying tribute to “just a truly original person,” as Reese Witherspoon put it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to believe,” said Jane Fonda in a tribute.\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was 79, and her cause of her death was  later revealed  to be from bacterial pneumonia, according to a death certificate obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department told CNN that they received a call for medical assistance on Saturday morning at Keaton’s address and paramedics transferred a person to a hospital. A law enforcement source confirmed the person transported was Keaton.\n \n\n   \n   Keaton  was a celebrated and prolific actor whose career spanned decades, early on earning an Academy Award in the best actress category for 1977’s “Annie Hall.” The film showcased Keaton’s abilities in the realm of comedy but also displayed her nimble handling of authentic and vulnerable moments.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, “Annie Hall” introduced filmgoers to Keaton’s matchless and gender-nonconforming sense of style – immediately identifiable by her use of men’s slacks, vests and hats. Decidedly ahead of her time from a fashion perspective, Keaton maintained a commitment to this sartorial mix well into her older years.\n \n\n   \n  An undeniable comedic talent who said in 1997 that she’s “more inclined to live comfortably in the world of humor,” Keaton nonetheless also made her mark in a number of dramatic movies – including a pivotal role in Francis Ford Coppola’s acclaimed “Godfather” films, in which she played Kay, wife to Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone.\n \n\n   \n    Starting out\n \n\n   \n  Keaton, who bore no relation to Buster or Michael, was born Diane Hall in 1946 in Los Angeles. In a 2004 “Fresh Air” podcast, she talked about how her mother, a homemaker and amateur photographer, won pageants and became Mrs. Highland Park and later Mrs. Los Angeles, which first gave her the urge to perform.\n \n\n   \n  “I did want to go on stage, I saw that that was something that did appeal to me,” she said. “There she was in the theater, and I saw the curtain open and there was my mother, and I thought, ‘Hm, I think I’d like that for myself.’”\n \n\n   \n  After finding her place on the theater stage in the late 1960s in a Broadway production of “Hair” – in which she gained some notoriety for declining to perform nude for one of the musical numbers and thereby forewent a sizable (at the time) $50 bonus – Keaton burst onto the film scene with the first “Godfather” film in 1972, going on to appear in several films throughout the decade opposite the writer and director Woody Allen, who was also her romantic partner around that time.\n \n\n   \n  The films they acted in together include Allen’s “Sleeper” and “Play It Again Sam,” but it was her star turn in “Annie Hall,” in which she played the joyous and carefree titular character who falls in love with Allen’s bumbling, self-hating comedian, that would prove most memorable.\n \n\n   \n    Leading lady\n \n\n   \n  From there, Keaton enjoyed leading star-status in a fair share of notable films, including 1977’s “Looking for Mr. Goodbar” and 1981’s “Reds” opposite Warren Beatty, a film that scored multiple Oscar nods including another one for her.\n \n\n   \n  Another classic film starring Keaton from the ’80s era was 1987’s “Baby Boom,” which featured her as a high-powered ad exec who suddenly finds herself saddled with the infant of a dead long-lost relative. The fish-out-of-water comedy costarred Sam Shepard and reminded audiences of Keaton’s deft skills at leading a movie that mixed the funny with the dramatic and thought-provoking.\n \n\n   \n  The 1990s saw Keaton team up with her contemporary Hollywood powerhouses Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn for the hit 1996 comedy “First Wives Club,” about a trio of women who exact artful revenge on their husbands after the men leave them for younger women. Raking in $181 million at the domestic box office, “First Wives” was welcome proof that a successful film didn’t exclusively have to include explosions or aliens, and could even be led by three women in their 50s.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the decade, Keaton earned a third Oscar nom for the tearjerker “Marvin’s Room,” in which she starred opposite Meryl Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film tells the story of an estranged pair of sisters who reunite to grapple with their past as well as the onset of illness.\n \n\n   \n    Far from slowing down\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was featured in several more acclaimed movies in the aughts – including the 2003 rom-com “Something’s Gotta Give” opposite Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves, in which she scored her fourth lead actor Academy Award nod – as well as “The Family Stone” from 2005, a modern-day Christmas classic with Keaton in the role of a matriarch who unwittingly helps her children find the partners they belong with.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, she appeared in “Book Club” in 2018, alongside Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen, as well as its 2023 sequel.\n \n\n   \n  She also starred in the comedy “Summer Camp” alongside Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard last year and had a few titles in the works – including a film with Blake Lively and Richard Gere, according to her IMDb.\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was also an accomplished producer and director. She helmed the acclaimed 1995 drama “Unstrung Heroes” starring Andie MacDowell, as well as “Hanging Up” in 2000. Her producing credits span over 30 years, with the most recent being an executive producer credit on 2023’s “Maybe I Do,” which starred Keaton, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Emma Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Unapologetically independent\n \n\n   \n  Keaton never married, and had been outspoken about her thinking on the topic, saying it goes back to her mother, as “most everything does.”\n \n\n   \n  “She had four kids, and I was the firstborn. I saw how much she gave up,” Keaton said in a 2021 piece for Interview. “I feel like she chose family over her dreams. And she was just the best mother, but I think that she is the reason why I didn’t get married. I didn’t want to give up my independence.”\n \n\n   \n  With her trademark humor, Keaton added, “By the way, no one has ever asked me to marry them, either, so that might be a good answer. I should’ve started with that and called it a day.”\n \n\n   \n  Keaton is survived by her two children, daughter Dexter, and son Duke. She adopted them both in her 50s.\n \n\n   \n  “The shocking thing is that I worry differently now,” Keaton told Life Magazine in 2005 about how motherhood changed her. “Before kids, if I worried, it was only about myself, but that’s all you do is worry as a parent. It’s rule number one in parenting: secretly worry without letting the kids know you’re worried.”\n \n\n   \n  When she was 69, Keaton told AARP Magazine, “At this age, everything seems much more astonishing. Like, Oh my goodness, look at that sycamore tree! Why didn’t I see that before? There’s a magical aspect, a wonder, to being on this planet.”\n \n\n   \n  Keaton’s death was first reported by People magazine. CNN has reached out to her representatives, who have not replied. Producer Dori Rath, who worked with Keaton, confirmed the actress had died to CNN on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/putin-trump-hungary-ukraine-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"17:37:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he will meet with Putin in Budapest to discuss war in Ukraine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, following a two-and-a-half-hour phone call described as 'very productive' by both sides.

 \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:37 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President  Donald Trump  said Thursday that he would meet with Russian President  Vladimir Putin  in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss the war in Ukraine after the two men had a lengthy phone call that Trump described as “very productive.”\n \n\n   \n  “President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this ‘inglorious’ War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end. President Zelenskyy and I will be meeting tomorrow, in the Oval Office, where we will discuss my conversation with President Putin, and much more,” the president said on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  The call between the two world leaders lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours and was held at the request of Russia, according to a Kremlin aide. It appeared to quickly shift Trump’s tone toward Russia, which has bucked his efforts to end the war. Trump later told reporters during an Oval Office event that he would meet with Putin “within two weeks or so.”\n \n\n   \n  He also noted in his social media post that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead a delegation of high-level advisors to meet with Russian officials next week, with a location to be determined, and then provided additional details to reporters later in the afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  “Marco Rubio is going to be meeting with his counterpart, as you know, (Russian Foreign Minister Sergey) Lavrov, and they’ll be meeting pretty soon. They’re going to set up a time and a place, very shortly, maybe it’s already set up. They’ve already spoken,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  Putin immediately supported Trump’s idea of a planned summit in Budapest to discuss ending the Ukraine war, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said, describing the call between the two leaders as “highly informative and extremely frank.”\n \n\n   \n  The plans come more than two months after Trump held his last in-person  summit with Putin  in Anchorage, Alaska.\n \n\n   \n  Budapest was a finalist for to host that meeting before officials ultimately landed on Alaska, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  has maintained a close relationship with Putin and Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Preparations for the USA-Russia peace summit are underway,” Orban announced on Thursday afternoon following a call with Tru﻿mp.\n \n\n   \n  “Hungary is the island of PEACE!” he posted on X.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A very good and productive call’\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in his post on social media that he believes “great progress was made with today’s telephone conversation” with Putin and noted a number of topics of discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East, something that, he said, has been dreamed of for centuries. I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine,” the president wrote in his social media post. “We also spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over.”\n \n\n   \n  Putin also thanked first lady Melania Trump during the call for her advocacy for children, Trump said. “He was very appreciative, and said that this will continue,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady  announced last week  that Russia had allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents, following months of private discussions between Russian officials and the first lady’s office centered on children separated from their families during the war.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed for more information after the conclusion of the call, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the administration would provide “more details as soon as we can.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was just talking with the president and the secretary of state and the vice president, and it was a very good and productive call. It lasted more than two hours,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has flashed frustration in recent weeks as Putin has continued the war in Ukraine. But Trump has shown little willingness to push for US-led measures that would punish the Kremlin.\n \n\n   \n  During the Oval Office event, Trump was asked about Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s plans for the chamber to soon take up sanctions legislation aimed at punishing Russia for its war against Ukraine. He suggested that it “may not be perfect timing” to pass the bipartisan measure, which has been held up for months as congressional leaders have deferred to the president’s desire to hold off on sanctions and pursue diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  “This may be such a productive call that we’re going to end up, we want to get peace. We want to stop the killing,” Trump said. “So I’m going to speak to him and the Speaker Mike Johnson. I’ll speak to them a little bit later, and I’ll tell them about this, and we’ll make the right determination. I’m not against anything. I’m just saying, it may not be perfect timing.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump and Zelensky to meet Friday\n \n\n   \n  The Trump-Putin call comes ahead of a meeting between the US leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously reported that Zelensky told a group of journalists in Kyiv that the main topics of his conversation with the president at the White House will include “air defense and our possibilities with long-range (missiles to put) pressure on Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has recently floated the possibility of giving Ukraine Tomahawk cruise missiles unless Russia dramatically changes its negotiating posture – a suggestion Zelensky pointed to as he announced his arrival in Washington, DC, on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Tomorrow, a meeting with President Trump is scheduled – and we expect that the momentum of curbing terror and war that succeeded in the Middle East will help to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Zelensky said on X. “The language of strength and justice will inevitably work against Russia as well. We can already see that Moscow is rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks.”\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin said Trump had told Putin that he would “take into account” Moscow’s concerns about American Tomahawks being supplied to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  In Thursday’s call, Putin repeated his longstanding view that “the Tomahawks would not change the situation on the battlefield, but that all of this would cause significant damage to relations between our countries, not to mention the prospects for a peaceful resolution,” Ushakov said during a Kremlin briefing.\n \n\n   \n  Ushakov added that Trump “also said that during his contact with Zelensky, he would, of course, take into account the considerations expressed by the president of Russia during today’s telephone conversation.”\n \n\n   \n  The president then confirmed in the Oval Office that the two leaders “talked about” the Tomahawk missiles for “a little bit.”\n \n\n   \n  “l, we talked about it a little bit. Didn’t say much, but I do say to you, you know, we need tomahawks for the United States of America, too,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/middleeast/hostage-bodies-israel-hamas-war-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-20:00","title":"Netanyahu says ‘struggle is not over’ as dispute with Hamas over hostage bodies continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, Israel and Hamas have made significant progress in releasing hostages and detainees.

Netanyahu says ‘struggle is not over’ as dispute with Hamas over hostage bodies continues \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, Eugenia Yosef, Tal Shalev, Sana Noor Haq, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:20 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday the country’s “struggle is not over,” just days after Israel and Hamas agreed to a  ceasefire deal  that has since been blighted by a dispute over the return of deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Hamas released the 20 remaining living hostages as part of the ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. Israel also released more than 1,700 Palestinian detainees it had been holding without charge, as well as 250 Palestinian prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  But in Israel, some of the  relief felt in the wake of the agreement  has been eclipsed by anger that Hamas so far has released only the remains of nine of the 28 deceased hostages held in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  In an address Thursday to commemorate fallen Israeli soldiers and mark the anniversary — under the Hebrew calendar — of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack, Netanyahu vowed that Israel will “achieve all the goals of this war.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl cemetery, Netanyahu declared: “The struggle is not over, but one thing is clear today: Anyone who raises his hand against us already knows that he will pay a very heavy price for his aggression. We are determined to complete the victory, a victory that will shape the course of our lives for many years.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ military wing said Wednesday that “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies of the remaining hostages in Gaza. In a statement, Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades said the group has “abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives in its possession and the corpses it could access.”\n \n\n   \n  But  Israel believes  that Hamas knows the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter. One of the sources said Israel believes that Hamas has access to at least six other bodies and possibly more. The source said Israel knows that five of the bodies “have disappeared,” while there is an ongoing dispute with Hamas about several other bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Israel and Hamas had agreed on a mechanism for searching for the remains of bodies whose whereabouts are unknown, but that mechanism has not begun operating.\n \n\n   \n  The United States does not believe that Hamas is violating its commitments to the agreement by failing to produce the bodies, two senior US advisers told CNN on Wednesday. The advisers said they received assurances from Hamas, via third-party mediators, that the group would do everything possible to return the remaining bodies.\n \n\n   \n  The US is actively working through mediators to provide intelligence and logistical support to locate the remaining bodies, which in many cases could be buried under rubble and debris. Large swaths of Gaza have been flattened by Israeli bombardment, and roughly 92% of housing in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged, according to the  latest United Nations figures  released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  An Israeli official told CNN that Israel has shared information, based on its intelligence, on the location of some of the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The US advisers also told CNN that other countries have offered help, including Turkey, which has proposed sending a team of body-retrieval specialists with expertise in locating remains left behind in earthquakes.\n \n\n   \n  The delay in securing the return of all the bodies is souring the elation felt by Israelis on Monday, when all 20 remaining living hostages came home.\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that the ceasefire deal “cannot continue to be implemented without Hamas returning all the hostages.” The group demanded that Hamas “fulfill its obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  “Any decision that weakens pressure on Hamas or allows the agreement to continue while hostages remain unreturned would be a grave moral and leadership failure,” the forum’s statement added in an apparent effort to place pressure on the Israeli government as well. “The job is not done. Our loved ones have not yet come home as promised.”\n \n\n   \n    Aid restrictions\n \n\n   \n  After threatening to restrict humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to pressure Hamas to release more bodies, Israel appears to have backed down and is now allowing quantities of aid into the enclave in line with the amounts required under the ceasefire agreement, US and Israeli officials said.\n \n\n   \n  A tally from Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), obtained by CNN, showed that more than 700 trucks crossed into Gaza on Wednesday, with fuel and gas among the items moved into the territory. The ceasefire agreement stipulates 600 trucks a day.\n \n\n   \n  A vast majority of the trucks went through the Kerem Shalom crossing near Egypt, while fewer than 100 crossed through Kissufim in central Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to COGAT for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ Government Media Office said 480 humanitarian aid trucks, including three with cooking gas and six with diesel fuel, entered Gaza on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, the UN had expressed concern over threatened restrictions on aid, saying it could not become a bargaining chip.\n \n\n   \n  “Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher said Wednesday in a statement on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Netanyahu has yet to declare the war officially over and has avoided the issue of a potential resumption of fighting.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s military still occupies roughly 50% of Gaza, and the ceasefire agreement stipulates that its withdrawal is contingent on Hamas disarming — two sticking points in the ceasefire deal that have  yet to be worked out .\n \n\n   \n  “Great challenges still lie ahead from enemies seeking to rearm,” Netanyahu said at Thursday’s ceremony. “Great challenges — and alongside them, dramatic opportunities to expand the circle of peace.”\n \n\n   \n  He also pledged once again to “bring back all the hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald  Trump said  he would consider allowing Netanyahu to resume military action in Gaza if Hamas refuses to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ibrahim Dahman and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/trump-hamas-warning-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"16:42:00Z","title":"Trump threatens to 'go in and kill' Hamas if group doesn’t stop killing in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric by threatening to allow Israel to resume military operations against Hamas in Gaza if the group continues killing civilians, marking a sharp reversal from his earlier claims that the war was effectively over.

have no choice but to go in and kill them,” marking a sharp escalation of his rhetoric against the group as he tries to maintain a ceasefire in its conflict with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The threat – just three days after the deal was signed in the Middle East – came amid reports that Hamas fighters have used the truce to quickly and violently reassert control over the Gaza Strip, targeting Palestinians who they deemed to have collaborated with Israeli forces during the war.\n \n\n   \n  “If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump later clarified that US forces would not be involved in the renewed offensive he had threatened.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not going to be us, we won’t have to,” he said in the Oval Office Thursday. “There are people very close, very nearby that will go and they’ll do the trick very easily, but under our auspices.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump had previously downplayed the prospect that US forces would need to get involved in peacekeeping as negotiators try to make headway on a permanent end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s warning nevertheless represented an abrupt shift from his far more optimistic tone in the immediate aftermath of the ceasefire agreement, which he first announced last week. At one point, he declared the war was effectively “over.” Trump had also shrugged off early reports that Hamas was cracking down on so-called gangs in the Palestinian territory, even as footage emerged of an apparent public execution.\n \n\n   \n  “They did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And that didn’t bother me much, to be honest with you. That’s OK.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet over the last 24 hours, the president has suggested in increasingly stern language that he might allow Israel to resume fighting if Hamas does not hold up its end of the deal,  telling CNN’s Jake Tapper  on Wednesday that the war would restart “as soon as I say the word.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel has already accused Hamas of breaking the agreement over the slow return of deceased hostages. And though Trump initially expressed ambivalence toward Hamas’ post-ceasefire attacks on Palestinians, he also warned that the group would ultimately have to disarm or “we will disarm them.”\n \n\n   \n  “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” Trump told Tapper in a brief telephone call. “If Israel could go in and knock the crap out of them, they’d do that.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to an Israeli source, but the nature of the conversation could not immediately be learned. In the Oval Office after that conversation, he expressed confidence the deal would hold.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that we have a commitment from them and I assume they’re going to honor their commitment,” he said of Hamas. “If they don’t behave, we’ll take care of it.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/trump-doj-first-terrorism-antifa-case","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-04:00","title":"Justice Department Brings First Terrorism Case Tied to Its Antifa Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has brought its first federal terrorism case in the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on Antifa, charging Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold (also known as Autumn Hill) with participating in a coordinated attack on a federal immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas.

federal terrorism case in the Trump administration’s crackdown on Antifa Wednesday, alleging that two people connected to the left-wing ideology participated in a coordinated attack on a federal immigration detention facility.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors accuse Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold, who also goes by the name Autumn Hill, of being members of an “Antifa Cell” that used vandalism and fireworks to draw law enforcement officers out of an immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas, and into the sights of two shooters positioned in a line of trees across the street.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment is a major step in the administration’s campaign against Antifa, which they say wants to violently challenge the federal government and Trump’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Trump designated Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization  last month. \n \n\n   \n  Until the case against Evetts and Arnold was unsealed Thursday, it was unclear how federal prosecutors planned to legally define Antifa as a terrorist organization. Antifa is largely thought of as more of an ideology than an organized group,  CNN has previously reported. \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors answered that question in court documents, describing Antifa as a “militant enterprise made up of networks of individuals and small groups” who have “espoused insurrection” and propose violent attacks against the US government.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for Arnold and Evetts didn’t immediately return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Late into the night of July 4, a group of roughly a dozen individuals began shooting fireworks and spray-painting cars and structures at the detention facility, prosecutors say. Around the same time two correctional officers at the facility began to approach the group, a local police officer arrived responding to 9-11 calls about the incident, court filings say.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the officer got out of his vehicle, one of the members of the group opened fire from a line of trees across the street, shooting him in the neck, prosecutors say. The officer survived the wound.\n \n\n   \n  Another member of the group began to fire at the officers and, after shooting 20 to 30 rounds, the group dispersed and fled the scene, court filings say.\n \n\n   \n  Detectives later said they determined that both rifles used in the shooting were purchased by ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song, who has been charged with attempted murder of a federal officer. Fourteen people were charged in relation to the shooting, including some who prosecutors say tried to hide Song after the incident.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment against Evetts and Arnold, members of the group had been planning the attack over group chats in the days prior, sharing a map of the area, discussing where security cameras could be located at the facility, as well as nearby police stations.\n \n\n   \n  In discussing what weapons to bring, Song suggested bringing “a wagon” of armor and rifles, adding that “cops are not trained or equipped for more than one rifle so it tends to make them back off,” prosecutors said in the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they recovered 10 guns from the group, some of which were left at the scene of the shooting. Four were purchased by Song, whose firearm was equipped with a binary trigger, prosecutors say, which allows a gun to shoot two bullets for every pull of the trigger.\n \n\n   \n  The goal of the group, according to the indictment against Evetts and Arnold, “was to destroy US government property and commit acts dangerous to human life intended to influence” US policy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/joe-rogan-trump-surprise-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:17:00-04:00","title":"Joe Rogan is unpleasantly surprised by Trump’s actions.

actions. He’s hardly alone \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:17 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Podcast host Joe Rogan last week bemoaned the state of  President Donald Trump’s  increasingly brutal and militarized mass deportation campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I did not ever anticipate seeing that on TV on a regular basis,” Rogan  said , referring to images of Trump “ripping parents out of their communities.”\n \n\n   \n  “I really thought they were just going to go after the criminals,” added Rogan, who sports heterodox political views but used his hugely popular show to  endorse Trump  on the eve of the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  There are two ways to look at Rogan’s comments. One is: How in the world did Rogan not think Trump would do this? While campaigning, Trump spoke openly about how  expansive and heavy-handed  this initiative would be. As far back as 2015, he approvingly cited   Dwight Eisenhower’s brutal deportation campaign .\n \n\n   \n  But the other is: Maybe Rogan isn’t alone. Maybe the extraordinary nature of what Trump is doing, on many fronts, is starting to set in and casual political followers are beginning to notice he’s going further than they countenanced.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a certain conventional wisdom right now that, while what Trump is doing is extreme, it’s pretty much what he promised. The American people voted for this — or at least 49.8% of them.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s worth calling that conventional wisdom into question.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, on several key fronts, large numbers of Americans didn’t seem to fully anticipate what Trump is now doing – or at least, the extent of it.\n \n\n   \n    Most Americans claim it’s what they expected, but …\n \n\n   \n  Polling during Trump’s second term has generally shown most Americans at least claim to be unsurprised by what the president is doing.\n \n\n   \n  An  AP-NORC poll  in April showed 71% of Americans said Trump’s first few months had been mostly what they expected. A  CBS News-YouGov poll  earlier this month showed more said Trump is doing “the same things he promised in the campaign” (52%) than said he was doing “different things” (48%).\n \n\n   \n  But these numbers might not tell the whole story.\n \n\n   \n  For one, people might not like to admit they were wrong about what Trump would do. Admitting Trump defied your expectations would imply that you got things wrong.\n \n\n   \n  And two, the CBS poll isn’t a particularly strong affirmation of Trump keeping his promises. It’s a very low bar to say Trump has generally done what he promised, and nearly half of Americans say he hasn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Fully 53% of independents and even about 1 in 5 Republicans say Trump isn’t doing what he promised. Those are large numbers.\n \n\n   \n  And very notably, the percentage of Americans who say Trump is clearing that low bar has dropped significantly. The percentage who say he’s doing the “same things he promised” has declined from  70% in February  to  61% in April  to 52% this month.\n \n\n   \n  That would suggest large numbers of people have gradually come to believe this wasn’t what the country signed up for.\n \n\n   \n    The specific policies\n \n\n   \n  Between the 2024 election and Trump’s inauguration,  CNN ,  New York Times-Ipsos  and  Reuters-Ipsos polling  tested a number of expectations for Trump’s policies in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  And in many cases, the American people were directionally right in what they predicted. The polls showed huge majorities thought it was at least plausible that Trump would deport millions of people, levy large tariffs and pardon lots of January 6, 2021, defendants, as Trump promised. A large majority also thought he would probably try and use the Justice Department against his foes.\n \n\n   \n  But even in some of these cases, it’s not difficult to see how Americans might be surprised by the extent of what Trump has done so far.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, the Ipsos polls showed two-thirds of Americans said it was at least “somewhat likely” that Trump would use the government to investigate and prosecute his foes, as he’s now done in the cases of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n \n\n   \n  But fewer than 4 in 10 said it was “very likely.”\n \n\n   \n  And the polls showed many or most Republicans wagered he wouldn’t do it. The Reuters-Ipsos poll showed as many as 69% of Republicans said Trump was “not likely” to use DOJ to go after his enemies.\n \n\n   \n  The story is similar, if less pronounced, with deportations.\n \n\n   \n  While a slight majority said Trump ordering mass deportations was at least “very likely,” according to the Reuters-Ipsos poll, nearly half rated it only “somewhat likely” or “not likely” – including half of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  Just 31% of Americans said it was “very likely” that Trump would increase tariffs on China and Mexico, which he has done.\n \n\n   \n  The polling on Trump’s January 6 pardons is also worth raising\n \n\n   \n  The CNN poll showed Americans predicted 78%-21% that Trump would pardon most people convicted of crimes for the attack on the Capitol, as Trump suggested he would.\n \n\n   \n  But he didn’t just pardon  most people ; he pardoned  virtually everyone  – including hundreds convicted of assaulting police and several convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  And he did so after providing tons of mixed messages about his intentions, at some points suggesting the pardons  would be reserved for nonviolent offenders .\n \n\n   \n    The conclusions\n \n\n   \n  The throughline here seems to be that lots of people thought it was possible Trump would do these things, but they didn’t necessarily see them as being especially likely.\n \n\n   \n  A likely reason why? Trump says lots of things, and many of them never come to fruition. He’s spent years inviting people to pick and choose what to take seriously and what to take literally. It’s a neat political trick that allows people to believe what they want and to ignore the rest by dismissing it as bluster.\n \n\n   \n  And the total picture suggests that people are indeed seeing things they didn’t fully expect – and now don’t like. On a plethora of issues, a majority of Americans have said Trump is going “too far,” and that  includes many who voted for him . Americans generally liked the idea of Trump’s mass deportation policy, but more recent polls show most  don’t like how he’s gone about it .\n \n\n   \n  A  Pew Research Center poll  from June is a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly half of Americans (48%) said Trump’s actions were worse than they expected, compared to about 2 in 10 who said they were better than expected.\n \n\n   \n  All of which would suggest it’s hardly just Rogan who’s been unpleasantly surprised.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia-voter-turnout-groups","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00Z","title":"Georgia voter turnout groups founded by Stacey Abrams are closing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two voter turnout organizations in Georgia, the New Georgia Project and its affiliated Action Fund, founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams in 2013, have announced their closure.

Their closure, along with  legal losses  sustained by another Abrams-founded organization — Fair Fight — raise questions about whether Abrams’ model of voter organizing can be sustained. The loss of the groups comes as Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff seeks reelection in 2026 and Democrats try to win a governor’s race in Georgia for the first time since 1998.\n \n\n   \n  “We recognize that the work of building a just and truthful world remains urgent,” directors said in a statement released by the Rev. James Woodall, who chaired the board of the New Georgia Project Action Fund. “This moment calls for strong and courageous leaders to step forward, guided by principles and purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  The groups registered tens of thousands of voters, building on Abrams’ belief that moderation wasn’t the path to power for Democrats in the Deep South. Instead, she sought to make steady voters out of less-engaged people who support progressive measures.\n \n\n   \n  The strategy won plaudits in 2018, when Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to Republican  Brian Kemp . Then in 2020, Democrat Joe Biden  won the state’s presidential vote  and a burst of enthusiasm elected Ossoff and Democrat Raphael Warnock to the US Senate in a  January 2021 runoff . That swung control of the upper chamber to their party.\n \n\n   \n  New Georgia Project organizers, in purple and orange or lime green t-shirts, were familiar sights in inner-city Atlanta neighborhoods and  rural Georgia towns , as the groups focused on areas with low turnout.\n \n\n   \n  “For progressive politics, I haven’t seen anything yet that is going to replicate the amount of outreach, door knocks, conversations that New Georgia Project was able to achieve,” said Stephanie Jackson Ali, who was the organization’s policy director until she was laid off in July.\n \n\n   \n  Abrams stepped down in 2017 and said she had no role with the groups thereafter. Warnock, a close Abrams ally and Baptist minister, was listed as the New Georgia Project’s CEO on corporate filings in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Abrams has said the group’s troubles are “disappointing” but declined further comment Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson Ali said the group  knocked on  4 million doors in 2020. But even with Abrams outraising Kemp in 2022 and with New Georgia Project and similar groups  beating the bushes  for voters,  Abrams lost to Kemp  by a larger margin than in 2018. Warnock did win reelection in a runoff that year, partly by projecting a more moderate image than Abrams. And 2024  was a step back  for Democrats in the state. Vice President Kamala Harris won 75,000 more Democratic votes in Georgia than Biden, but Republican turnout for Trump increased by 200,000, powering him to victory.\n \n\n   \n  But the New Georgia Project faced additional headwinds, with questions about leadership and spending dragging on donations. The Georgia Ethics Commission levied a  record-breaking $300,000 fine  against the groups in January after finding they did illegal election work and fundraising for Abrams in 2018 by failing to register as an independent campaign committee before taking contributions and failing to file campaign finance reports of contributions and spending.\n \n\n   \n  The fine was followed by multiple rounds of layoffs, including of some employees who said they were targeted for trying to unionize.\n \n\n   \n  Ethics Commission Executive Director David Emadi said the groups have “fully complied with the order,” with the final installment of the fine paid over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson Ali said it has been “heartbreaking” to watch the New Georgia Project struggle for funding.\n \n\n   \n  “We just had such a large apparatus, that as soon as funding slowed, we couldn’t be sustained,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/jb-pritzker-gambling-las-vegas-million","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"JB Pritzker explains how he won $1.4 million gambling in Las Vegas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Illinois Governor JB Pritzker disclosed that he won $1.4 million playing blackjack in Las Vegas during a vacation with friends, which his campaign has reframed as a demonstration of personal luck and transparency.

hard-hitting report says \n       \n  By Christopher Lamb, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:17 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Vatican commission for the protection of children has said the mishandling by the Catholic Church’s leaders of  sexual abuse allegations  involving clergy is causing “ongoing harm” to victims, in a hard-hitting report released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The report also called out parts of Italy and Africa for failing to implement robust anti-abuse measures.\n \n\n   \n  The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which released its second  annual report  on October 16 called for greater transparency from the Vatican and noted with “concern” that survivors often perceive the church’s central administration as “lacking in sensitivity.”\n \n\n   \n  The report is the first to be released since the election of Pope Leo XIV and it sets out the scale of the challenge for the American pope in tackling the scourge of sexual abuse of children and vulnerable people inside the Catholic Church. His predecessor, Pope Francis, took some important steps to tackle the abuse crisis but  experts and survivors have said he could have gone further .\n \n\n   \n  “We must re-emphasise that the Church’s decades-long pattern of mishandling reports, including abandoning, ignoring, shaming, blaming, and stigmatising victims/survivors, perpetuates the trauma as an ongoing harm,” the report states.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the report calls for the Church to offer “reparations” for damage done by abuse, including psychological and financial support, sensitive listening to survivors, public and private apologies and reforms to how abuse is handled.\n \n\n   \n  It includes scathing statements from survivors, who describe “denial and dismissal” from church authorities and even “disturbing accounts of retaliation” taken by bishops and other leaders when victims came forward. Survivors also talked about a “lack of psychological care” for those affected and “strong resistance to safeguarding reforms” in churches at the grassroots level. A “lack of accountability” from the hierarchy was frequently cited as an issue.\n \n\n   \n  “Figures of authority within the Church who perpetrate or enable abuse have perhaps viewed themselves as too essential and important to be held accountable. The Church’s response to abuse should not repeat the same mistakes,” the report states.\n \n\n   \n  On accountability, the commission calls on the Vatican to start communicating the reason for a bishop’s resignation or removal if this is related to “cases of abuse or negligence.” The current practice is for the Vatican to simply announce when a bishop has resigned without elaborating.\n \n\n   \n  The commission is led by French archbishop Thibault Verny and includes a mixture of church leaders and experts, among them Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, a Dutch lawyer and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children who led the compilation of the report.\n \n\n   \n  The 200-page document provides an assessment on how churches in various parts of the world are dealing with abuse, including on the pope’s doorstep in Italy. Catholic groups and victims have long argued that the Catholic Church in Italy has yet to face up to abuse scandals and needs to entrust this to an independent body.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at a Vatican press conference to release the report, de Boer-Buquicchio thanked the media for “uplifting the voices of victims and survivors when the institutional church has failed to listen.” She stressed that victim-survivors repeatedly state they “want to feel heard and validated in their experiences.”\n \n\n   \n  Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera, the secretary of the commission, said that Pope Leo had the “same strong commitment” to tackling abuse as his predecessor, although brings an “analytical” style. The Colombian prelate also recognised the call for the Church to move faster in tackling abuse.\n \n\n   \n  In its report, the pontifical commission highlights failures in the Italian church. While it cites “significant progress” on child protection, it warns that “substantial cultural resistance in Italy to addressing abuse” remains. Pointedly, it said it “regrets” that significant portions of the church leadership have not even met with the Vatican’s abuse commission and that several dioceses did not provide information to the commission about their safeguarding work.\n \n\n   \n  The Italian bishops’ conference said the abuse commission report contained “partial data” and insisted that “all Italian regions and dioceses” have a protection service.\n \n\n   \n  “The Report does not account for all this work,” the bishops’ conference said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in Africa, protocols for dealing with abuse were frequently found to be severely lacking, the commission said. In Equatorial Guinea, the report said, it could not find “any mention of procedures for receiving complaints” and in Ethiopia it cited “resistance” from leaders to take “direct responsibility” for abuse. Bishops in Kenya   said “cultural taboos make reporting very difficult for victims/survivors,” the report added.\n \n\n   \n  The commission also calls on the Vatican’s Dicastery for Evangelization, a department which deals with churches in the developing world, to invest more in the drawing up of anti-abuse policies, noting a “lack of sufficient resources” when it comes to vetting the safeguarding records of candidates to become bishops.\n \n\n   \n  The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors was established by Pope Francis in 2014 and in 2022 he asked them to draw up an annual report on how the church was dealing with abuse and safeguarding. The first  report was published last year .\n \n\n   \n  Since his election on May 8, Leo XIV has said it is “urgent to ingrain throughout the Church a culture of prevention that does not tolerate any form of abuse,” while praising journalists for uncovering abuse scandals.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/trump-ukraine-strikes-putin-energy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"After Putin Summit, Trump Changed His Mind on Supporting Ukraine’s Strikes on Russian Energy Targets, Sources Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a failed peace summit in Alaska in summer 2025 between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the US has reversed its earlier restrictions on Ukraine’s strikes against Russian energy infrastructure.

increased intelligence sharing with Ukraine to include information on targets deeper inside Russian territory as part of a strategic shift both countries hope will restart negotiations with Moscow that stalled after the  summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska  this summer failed to produce a peace agreement, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to push Trump for additional long-range weapons capable of striking targets inside Russian territory when he meets with Trump in Washington at the White House on Friday.\n \n\n   \n   Trump has indicated he is open to the idea in the days leading up to Zelensky’s visit, underscoring how his mindset about the war has changed since the Alaska summit.\n \n\n   \n  The shift to provide intelligence with a focus on energy-related sites and facilities that the Trump administration had previously told Kyiv were off limits occurred following Trump’s meeting with Putin at a US military base in Alaska this summer, both sources said. Trump was unable to secure an agreement with Putin that would bring an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  In the wake of the summit, the US has attempted to increase pressure on Putin including the change in intelligence sharing that the Trump administration hopes will alter the Russian leader’s calculus on continuing the war.\n \n\n   \n  The Financial Times was first to report on US support for Ukraine’s ongoing campaign to target Russian energy infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration had asked Ukraine to avoid striking Russia’s oil, gas and energy infrastructure ahead of the summit as officials pursued a peace deal with Moscow. But the US gave Ukraine the green light to resume attacks against those targets after both leaders left Alaska without an agreement in hand, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  With US approval, Ukraine has now adopted a deliberate strategy of targeting Russia’s energy-related infrastructure, the source said. With the front lines effectively frozen, and more than a million total casualties during the conflict, Ukraine believes targeting Russian energy infrastructure is one of the few remaining ways to produce strategic effects, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a war that never would have happened had President Trump been President, something President Putin himself acknowledged, and President Trump is trying to get it stopped,” a White House official said when asked by CNN for comment on the change in intelligence sharing. “The President also negotiated a historic agreement to allow NATO allies to purchase American-made weapons. We do not have further announcements at this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Putin and Trump had what Trump described in a post on Truth Social as a “lengthy call” on Thursday, the day before Zelensky’s arrival at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  It remains unclear how many more energy-related targets remain unscathed and whether Ukraine maintains the long-range strike capability to successfully destroy facilities located deep inside Russia — datapoints that would help demonstrate whether the current strategy could be ultimately successful. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested that his military needs additional help from the US to do so, repeatedly requesting American-made, long-range weapons in the weeks since the Alaska summit.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has indicated he is open to the idea, recently floating the possibility of giving Ukraine Tomahawk cruise missiles unless Russia dramatically changes its negotiating posture. Ahead of a planned meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, Zelensky told a group of journalists in Kyiv that the main topics of his conversation will include “air defense and our possibilities with long-range (missiles to put) pressure on Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, the Ukrainian leader was keen to signal Tomahawk use might be closer. “We see and hear that Russia is afraid that the Americans may give us Tomahawks, which is a signal that exactly such pressure may work for peace,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Tuesday that Zelensky is  coming to the White House  on Friday to push for the US to give him long-range Tomahawk missiles, which would allow the country to penetrate deep into Russian territory.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what he has to say. He wants weapons. He would like to have Tomahawks,” Trump told reporters while meeting with his Argentinian counterpart, Javier Milei, at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Sunday if he would send the missiles, Trump said, “We’ll see … I may,” adding, “I might tell them that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, we may not, but we may do it. Do they (Russia) want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A US official stressed that, regardless of what happens, what is most important is providing Ukraine with Tomahawks is under serious discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, himself, has repeatedly expressed amazement about the prospect of Ukraine having the ability to strike Moscow or St. Petersburg, including on recent calls with Zelensky, according to another source familiar with the conversations. During one call following the Alaska summit, Trump asked Zelensky if his military had the ability to hit Moscow or St Petersburg. The Ukrainian leader responded by saying they could if they had the right weapons, sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, the US has increased intelligence sharing and approved a sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles — which appear to be the first tangible steps Trump has taken to bolster Ukraine’s long-range capabilities following the summit with Putin.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration did not place any explicit restrictions on how Ukraine can use those extended-range missiles that were part of a recently-approved $825 million arms sale, according to two US officials familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration similarly did not establish any limitations for how Ukraine could use weapons it provided to Ukraine that were technically capable of striking targets inside Russia, most notably Army Tactical Missile Systems or ATACMs, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  But ATACMs offer less range than Tomahawks or ERAMs requiring Ukrainian forces to quickly move and hide the launchers to get them close to enemy lines, the source said. The air-delivered missiles approved by the Trump administration offer more flexibility.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless it can still be challenging for aircraft using ERAM missiles to get close to the border because of Russian MiG fighter patrols, the source added, limitations that have fueled Ukraine’s request for Tomahawks and other long-range weapons.\n \n\n   \n  The Tomahawks’ 1,500-mile range and speed mean they only make sense evading air defenses and striking valuable infrastructure deep inside Russia. The Kremlin has suggested US personnel would have to operate such sophisticated weaponry, and that Tomahawks can be nuclear capable – saber-rattling that weaponizes fears around unintentional escalation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/republicans-white-house-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"14:59:00Z","title":"‘The communication culture sucks’: Republicans on Capitol Hill in the dark on Trump administration decisions during shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During an ongoing government shutdown, Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill report being left in the dark about major decisions by the Trump administration, including the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in energy projects and the layoffs of over 4,000 federal employees.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:59 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the government shutdown drags on, many congressional Republicans are in the dark about the Trump administration’s decisions over which federal workers are being laid off and which federal contracts are being cancelled.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple GOP lawmakers told CNN they are only finding out about the decisions – which have far-reaching consequences for the constituents they represent – after they’ve been made public.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, President Donald Trump and his team have  announced the cancellation  of nearly $8 billion dollars for energy projects around the country and  layoffs  of over 4,000 federal employees. While the cuts have so far largely targeted Democratic strongholds and priorities, some GOP lawmakers are frustrated with the administration over what they describe as a lack of communication or coordination.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mark Amodei says he found out that $202 million dollars’ worth of battery recycling projects were being cancelled in his Nevada district via press release.\n \n\n   \n  And he’s tired of being the last to find out about big decisions from the administration that impact his constituents.\n \n\n   \n  “The communications culture sucks,” Amodei told CNN in a phone interview.\n \n\n   \n  As calls started pouring into his office from people thinking that as the only Republican in his state’s delegation, he would have been clued into the latest cancellation in his district, Amodei had to reveal that has not been the case.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like, you know who the person is with the least amount of information on that cancelation decision? Is the guy that they’re calling in Congress,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The plan to cancel federal contracts in his district didn’t even come up in a recent conversation he had with Energy Secretary Chris Wright before the cancellation was publicly announced, Amodei told CNN. Instead, Amodei said the pair spoke about a lithium project in his district and a separate solar project.\n \n\n   \n  Wright recently said on CNN after the mass cancellations were announced that “our decisions have been made over the last few months.”\n \n\n   \n  “I hope you’re not paying anybody for congressional relations. Because if you are, you ought to get your money back,” Amodei said, reacting to that comment. “Months ago?”\n \n\n   \n  And this is not the first time Amodei, a senior member on the House Appropriations Committee, has been left in the dark, telling CNN he can’t remember a time that the Trump administration has given him a heads up on anything. There was also a $95 million dollar goldmines project that was cancelled in his district over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Energy Department said, “Multiple members of Rep. Amodei’s office were notified about both projects referenced.”\n \n\n   \n  “Since day one, the Energy Department has been clear that it was conducting a department-wide review to ensure all activities and financial awards follow the law and align with the Trump administration’s priorities. The American people provided President Trump with a mandate to govern and to unleash affordable, reliable and secure energy,” the spokesperson added.\n \n\n   \n  Amodei’s office told CNN that the Department of Energy informed it of the cancellations on the same day that the company found out.\n \n\n   \n  Senior White House officials have kept in close touch with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune through the shutdown, largely relying on the two congressional leaders to manage communications and tamp down any unrest within the rest of the conference, aides and advisers said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration has been completely transparent and communicative with Congress about the actions they need to take to preserve the continuity of government operations during the Democrat Shutdown,” a spokesperson for the speaker’s office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  And White House budget chief Russell Vought has held at least one conference call with House Republicans since the shutdown began, though sources on that call said not a lot of specifics were shared at that point.\n \n\n   \n  But a number of Republicans were blunt in describing their lack of insight into the administration’s process.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, told CNN, “the Appropriations Committee in general believes that it should get more information and that we should receive a list of canceled or paused contracts, as well as more specifics on which federal employees are being fired and justification for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Collins acknowledged that “sometimes” she gets a call right before a cancellation is announced, but said, “we are not really consulted.”\n \n\n   \n  Even as the holder of the purse strings in the Senate, Collins said on Wednesday that she had still not received the specifics on how the administration has reallocated funds to pay military troops, but said she had been given two different explanations.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a White House official said the administration “has been very communicative with Hill Republicans about shutdown-related actions.”\n \n\n   \n  The official said that’s “one of the many reasons” why the White House, Thune and Johnson “have all been in lockstep on priorities and actions.”\n \n\n   \n  But the aggressive moves by the administration during the shutdown reflect a broader view within the White House that Congress exists chiefly to enable Trump’s agenda, rather than serve as an equal partner in shaping it.\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of his second term, Trump has wrested key authorities away from Congress with little resistance from Republican lawmakers, drastically tipping the power balance between the two branches in a matter of months. That’s included carrying out a major bombing campaign on Iran without first seeking congressional authorization. More recently, the administration has unilaterally conducted lethal strikes on boats in the Caribbean it claims were trafficking drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has also seized spending authorities from Congress, singlehandedly withholding billions of dollars that Republicans had appropriated just months earlier.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions have so far prompted some discontent from GOP lawmakers, but no signs of a revolt as most Republicans on Capitol Hill are deferential to the administration, further emboldening Trump. And as the shutdown drags on, officials have similarly brushed off criticism of their retaliatory cuts, especially as much of it comes from a handful of lawmakers like Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski who have long been at odds with the president.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, Johnson has had weekly conference calls to update his members who remain in their districts, and Thune is in regular communication with his senators as the Senate remains in session. Johnson and Thune, who have remained in lockstep, speak to the president regularly and both Republican leaders were at the White House on  Tuesday  when Trump posthumously awarded Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Both Republican leaders have defended the White House’s decision to fire federal workers during the shutdown and have consistently blamed Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune has described the administration’s layoffs of thousands of federal workers as a decision “forced on” them by Senate Democrats as the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not comfortable with any of this being done, because, as I’ve said, I don’t like government shutdowns. Nobody wins in a government shutdown,” Thune said Wednesday. “These are decisions I should say that are being forced on the administration by the Democrats voting repeatedly — it’ll be the ninth time today — to keep the government shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, even as some members grumble about being kept in the dark, few have proven willing to go out of their way to directly criticize Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s why Johnson’s not bringing the House back,” Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a close Trump ally, said of GOP leaders’ efforts to keep the conference unified. “That’s to minimize the ability of members to come back and complain too much.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has maintained that there’s no reason for the House to return until the government reopens. Yet even as he’s sought to keep the focus on Democrats, the administration’s moves have at times seemed to catch him off guard.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday afternoon, Johnson told CNN he hadn’t received the details of the Trump administration’s offer to Argentina of a $20 billion lifeline – with consideration of even more – and was awaiting information.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he was okay with the bailout given the US debt and the government shutdown, the speaker replied, “I’m trying to get the details on that. I didn’t talk about it with the president last night when I was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed further, the speaker said, “I’ve been really busy, as you’ve probably noticed, but I’m waiting to get an update on it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even as Trump has said that cuts during the shutdown will be “Democrat-oriented,” with no clear end in sight to the impasse over funding, the White House’s insistence that it will carry out additional reductions is likely to further raise the risk that projects and constituents in some Republican districts end up affected.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking with CNN recently, Wright said more funding cuts will likely be coming to red states.\n \n\n   \n  “As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright  told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins. \n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Vought said firings across the government could end up exceeding 10,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’ll get more,” Vought said on the Charlie Kirk Show of the reductions in force. “We’re going to keep those RIFs rolling.”\n \n\n   \n  If more firings are coming, most Republicans say they likely won’t find out about it until after they occur and are publicized.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by CNN if she is kept in the loop on the administration’s decisions and whether her constituents would be impacted, GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa said, “they don’t give us information ahead, but if we request information, they’ve been willing to provide that information for us.”\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, whose state is home to more than 18,000 federal workers, said “no” she is not part of the decision-making process about how federal dollars in her state are cut or who gets laid off.\n \n\n   \n  Even GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who launched a Senate caucus to partner with the Department of Government Efficiency, said she is “not in the decision-making process” and is instead “just asking for information and transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  The communication between the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill who are not in leadership has been even more strained during the shutdown as many federal workers at agencies are furloughed and can’t respond to lawmaker requests.\n \n\n   \n  With severe flooding ravaging her state of Alaska, Murkowski told CNN, “You’re trying to get answers from the agency and people aren’t answering the phones because they’ve been furloughed — that doesn’t help us.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being largely out of the loop on the recent announcements the Trump administration has made as it relates to federal contracts and employees, many Republicans contend that their calls would be answered if needed.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska, who was part of a phone call with Vought last week, said he wasn’t told ahead of time about the cancellation of $8 billion dollars of energy projects or the 4,000 federal workers getting fired, but still praised Vought and his team.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had great communication,” Flood told CNN. “Russ Vought and his staff had said things like ‘hey, if you see something that you’re concerned about, communicate with us, we’ll look into it.’”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/14/us/cody-balmer-guilty-plea-arson-josh-shapiro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"12:03:00-12:03","title":"Pennsylvania man pleads guilty in arson attack at governor’s mansion while Shapiro’s family slept","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Pennsylvania man, Cody Balmer, pleaded guilty to multiple charges including attempted murder, arson, and aggravated assault after scaling a fence and setting fire to the governor’s mansion on April 13, 2025, while Gov.

eluded police and used beer bottles filled with gasoline to ignite the occupied  Pennsylvania governor’s mansion  pleaded guilty Tuesday to attempted murder ﻿of Gov. Josh Shapiro and other charges.\n \n\n   \n  Cody Balmer also entered pleas to terrorism, 22 counts of arson, aggravated arson, burglary, aggravated assault of Shapiro, 21 counts of reckless endangerment and loitering in the April 13 attack that caused millions of dollars in damage to the state-owned brick building.\n \n\n   \n  Under a plea deal, Balmer was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison, far less than he could have faced if the case had gone to trial. He declined to address the judge about the crime, answering questions with short, simple answers.\n \n\n   \n  According to the court sentencing order, Balmer was also required to pay restitution of $100,000.\n \n\n   \n  Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo told CNN this would go toward repair costs for the extensive damage to the governor’s residence caused by the fire.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Bryan Walk said Balmer “is taking full responsibility” and paying “a hefty price for a man who’s 38 years old.”\n \n\n   \n  Shapiro said during a news conference soon after the sentencing that he and his family support the plea deal, and that it provides real accountability.\n \n\n   \n  Shapiro and members of his family had to be  awakened and evacuated , but no one was injured. The multiple arson and endangerment charges reflected the number of people in the residence at the time, including the governor’s family, guests and state troopers.\n \n\n   \n  Shapiro lamented the impact of political violence, warning it is discouraging candidates from running for office. He said his family isn’t alone in experiencing political violence, and it shouldn’t be accepted as the normal course of doing business.\n \n\n   \n  Shapiro said as leaders across the world have reached out to him after the attack, “inevitably, those conversations turn to their own sense of vulnerability and their own worry about political violence.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he has talked to potential candidates who said they don’t want to run because it would put their families at risk.\n \n\n   \n  The fire was set hours after they celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover with a Seder in the residence. Prosecutors played video clips that showed Molotov cocktails going off and a figure inside and outside the residence. Judge Deborah Curcillo called the video “horrific” and “very frightening.”\n \n\n   \n  Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo told the court the video shows Balmer hitting the doors leading to where Shapiro and his family were sleeping, but he was unable to get through. Smoke was building up inside as Balmer deployed the second incendiary device. Fifteen overnight guests — including children — and two state troopers were inside.\n \n\n   \n  Shapiro and his wife, Lori, provided a victim statement read in court that described how they were left feeling exposed in ways they would not have imagined, calling it “a fear and anxiety we are learning to live with.” The experience has added stress to their children’s lives, they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Balmer told police he planned to beat Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he had encountered him after breaking into the building, according to court documents. Balmer  turned himself in  the next afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Police say Balmer broke in through the southern wing of the residence, into a room often used to entertain crowds and display art. Investigators recovered two broken glass beer bottles containing gasoline. The fire charred walls, tables, buffet serving dishes, plates and a piano. Window panes and brick around doors and windows were also damaged.\n \n\n   \n  The attack against a Jewish governor during the Passover weekend raised questions about Balmer’s motivation, but Balmer told The Associated Press in a May letter from jail that had not been a factor in his decision.\n \n\n   \n  “He can be Jewish, Muslim, or a purple people eater for all I care and as long as he leaves me and mine alone,” Balmer wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Chardo said Balmer told investigators he was concerned about the war in Gaza and “the potential for many millions dying — his words. And he said, you know, even if I just have to take a life, I’m not crazy about having to take a life, but I will if it’s because of the millions endangered. So he viewed this as an offset to the the war in the Middle East.”\n \n\n   \n  Balmer told the AP in a brief June 9 video interview from Camp Hill State Prison that he did think beforehand about whether children might be injured.\n \n\n   \n  “Does anyone ever consider children?” Balmer said in June. “It doesn’t seem that way. I sure as hell did. I’m glad no one got hurt.” Asked why he felt Shapiro had somehow done him wrong, Balmer replied: “I’m not going to answer that.”\n \n\n   \n  Balmer’s mother said days after his arrest that she had tried to get him assistance for mental health issues, but “nobody would help.” Court proceedings had been delayed while he received mental health treatment, his lawyer has said.\n \n\n   \n  A letter from Balmer’s relatives read in court on Tuesday said he stopped taking medication, leading to manic episodes and a “dark and difficult path.”\n \n\n   \n  At a court hearing a few days after the fire, Balmer told a judge he was an unemployed welder with no income or savings and “a lot of children.”\n \n\n   \n  The residence, built in 1968, did not have sprinklers. Work to fix the damage and to bolster its security features continues.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/world/mi5-security-uk-threats-hostile-states-terrorists-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:43:00-04:00","title":"‘A new era’: UK facing rising threats from state actors as well as terrorists, says MI5 chief","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"MI5 chief Ken McCallum warns that the UK is entering a 'new era' of national security threats, marked by a 35% rise in investigations into state-sponsored espionage over the past year.

as well as terrorists, says MI5 chief \n       \n  By Nick Paton Walsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:43 AM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United Kingdom has seen a 35% rise in the last year in the number of suspects investigated annually for possibly working for a hostile foreign government, the head of the UK’s domestic security service, MI5, said in a speech Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  In the service’s annual update on threats facing the UK, Ken McCallum said, “A more hostile world is forcing the biggest shifts in MI5’s mission since 9/11,” and that his “teams are currently running near-record volumes of investigations.”\n \n\n   \n  Opening his speech, McCallum expressed sympathies for the two people killed in an  ISIS-linked attack on a synagogue in Manchester  earlier this month. The head of the secretive agency added that the “aggregate scale of the terrorist threat is huge,” and the combination of rising threats from state actors as well as from a mix of terrorists with “Islamist, extreme right wing or other ideologies” – who might be well-prepared, teenage or mentally disturbed – heralded a “new era.”\n \n\n   \n  The UK has seen a variety of  espionage  and sabotage incidents in recent years, from Chinese influence operations targeting the parliament to Russian-directed arson against warehouses supplying Ukraine’s forces. McCallum also said there had been “more than 20 potentially lethal Iran-backed plots” in the past year.\n \n\n   \n  “State threats are increasing. … In the last year, we’ve seen a 35% increase in the number of individuals we’re investigating for involvement in state threat activity,” he said, adding that these individuals were present in the UK rather than directing operations from overseas.\n \n\n   \n  “The state threat activity I’m describing is overwhelmingly dominated by the triumvirate of Russian, Chinese and Iranian state actors,” McCallum continued.\n \n\n   \n  Asked to describe the nature of the Russian threat,   he said: “In terms of its lethality, the activities are spread. This ranges from, in some cases, arson, in some cases attempted sabotage. In some cases, pretty detailed attempts to gather specific targeting information about individuals. … the only obvious purpose of which would be to make it feasible for someone then to do something nasty, potentially lethal, towards those individuals.”\n \n\n   \n  In May, Orlin Roussev, 47, was sentenced in a London court to nearly 11 years in jail for leading a British-based Russian spy   ring, which prosecutors said carried out surveillance for the Kremlin. Five other members of the ring were jailed for a total of about 40 years, all accused of gathering detailed information on journalists, dissidents and Ukrainian soldiers being trained at a US military base in Germany. Prosecutors said the six, all Bulgarian nationals, were financially motivated and did not report directly to Russian intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  In his speech, McCallum alluded twice to “proxies” for Russia perhaps not receiving payment for their work from their handlers, yet declined to provide specifics. “I am able legally to say, I don’t think it’s a good career move to work for the Russian Intelligence Services in the United Kingdom,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  McCallum also warned of the role artificial intelligence can play in future and present threats, saying ,  “Would-be terrorists already try to harness AI for their propaganda, their weapons research, their target reconnaissance.” Yet he cautioned against “hype and scaremongering” and said that he believed AI as a whole brought “real benefits” in threat detection.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not forecasting Hollywood movie scenarios,” he added. “Artificial intelligence may never ‘mean’ us harm. But it would be reckless to ignore the potential for it to cause harm.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/pentagon-lawyers-sidelined-jags","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"12:52:00-04:00","title":"How the Pentagon Sidelined Lawyers While Testing the Legal Limits of Military Action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon has systematically sidelined top military lawyers, including Lt.

Gen. Joe Berger, who had taken the top posting in July 2024, was asked for his advice about the legality of using Texas National Guard soldiers for immigration enforcement. Berger told Army chief of staff Gen. Randy George that he was skeptical and wanted more information about whether the soldiers were properly trained for that kind of mission, according to a former senior defense official and another person familiar with his actions.\n \n\n   \n  He was told by the department’s acting general counsel, Charlie Young, to stop meddling in state affairs, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in early February, Berger and his team began asking questions of civilian leaders about the legality of firing huge swaths of probationary Defense Department employees, which was being pushed at the time by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Defense officials across the services  were raising concerns  that the summary firings could break the law and potentially harm the US military’s ability to fight.\n \n\n   \n  But when officials in Berger’s office sought to discuss the legal basis of the mass purge —which they would likely have to defend in court — Young refused to speak to them altogether, making clear he would only speak to the Army’s top civilian lawyer at the time, the sources recalled.\n \n\n   \n  Then, on February 14, the right-wing social media account LibsofTikTok, which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has frequently engaged with on X, accused Berger of running afoul of Hegseth’s anti-diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n \n\n   \n  The Army denied that accusation, also on X. But one week later, Hegseth fired Berger. A second top legal officer, the Air Force’s Judge Advocate General, Lt. Gen. Charles Plummer, was also fired. Hegseth told reporters later that he viewed them as potential “roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander-in-chief.”\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Secretary of Defense didn’t respond to specific questions about Berger’s or Young’s conduct. Young is likely to be confirmed soon as the new Army general counsel, having been nominated by President Donald Trump in April.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen current and former defense officials, including four current Judge Advocate General corps officers, told CNN that Berger and Plummer’s firings appeared to be the first warning shots by a new administration intent on pushing the boundaries of the law — whether by kicking all transgender troops out of the military, firing thousands of civil servants, deploying National Guard troops to cities over the objections of governors or launching lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Decapitating those organizations”—the Army and Air Force JAG Corps—“was an easy way for Hegseth to send a strong message from the outset and put the entire JAG corps on notice,” a defense official familiar with his thinking told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, the senior JAGS of the military branches have been duty bound to provide candid and apolitical legal advice to top leaders. The senior-most JAGS, and the thousands of lower-ranking JAG officers across the services, are expected to be neutral arbiters of US and international law to determine an order’s lawfulness and empower commanders and troops to fulfill their duty to disobey illegal commands.\n \n\n   \n  But when looking for the JAGS’ replacements, Hegseth’s staff prioritized questions about whether candidates agreed with former President Joe Biden’s policies rather than their interpretations of law, the former official and another person familiar with the interviews said. Candidates were asked, for example, how they felt about requiring COVID-19 vaccines for troops and allowing transgender troops to serve, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Current and former defense officials told CNN they believe the interviews amounted to “political litmus tests.” Two of the JAG officers CNN spoke to said that they have become increasingly nervous about vocalizing their independent legal opinions because they’re worried about getting fired.\n \n\n   \n  “Hegseth’s rhetoric and policies are perceived as a bit unhinged and counterproductive, but the way forward is just to eat it and put your head down and act in accordance with his new policies,” said one current Army JAG. “No JAG is trying to rock the boat or get noticed.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Get them out of the way’\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth has made other moves beyond the firings to significantly change the role and responsibilities of military lawyers. He reduced the rank requirement for the top uniformed military legal posts from three stars to two stars for admirals and generals, effectively relegating them to second-tier legal advisers, the former senior defense official said.\n \n\n   \n  And he plans to transfer up to 600 JAGs to the Justice Department to serve as immigration judges, removing them from the military justice system altogether, defense officials familiar with the planning said. DoD spokesperson Sean Parnell told CNN last month that “at the request of the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense is identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges.”\n \n\n   \n  “I see this as part of a grander plan to remove lawyers from the [military’s] operational forces and get them out of the way,” said the former senior defense official.\n \n\n   \n  Not all JAG officers are concerned about the changes — the JAG corps is a huge and varied institution. Thousands serve in the Army, Air Force, and Navy JAG corps.\n \n\n   \n  An Army JAG said he’s not surprised that some officers are feeling political heat— the reality, he said, is that top military lawyers, despite wanting to view themselves as completely apolitical, are usually unable to stay out of the political fray given the policies they’re routinely expected to defend or oppose.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s still a client, and while the oath to the Constitution is the number one priority, you’re still expected to represent your client to the best of your ability,” the JAG officer said. “And sometimes that means the legal argument picks up a political bent.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth has repeatedly publicized his view that the military justice system is overbearing and out of touch. He referred to JAGs pejoratively as “jagoffs” in his 2024 book The War on Warriors, writing that he believed that JAGs preferred to investigate US troops rather than “bad guys” because it was “easier to get promoted that way.”\n \n\n   \n  He tapped his personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, to coordinate an overhaul of the military legal system, beginning at the top. “I am so excited for this opportunity to return to service and help to make significant improvements to our military justice system to best support the warfighter,” Parlatore  wrote on X  in March.\n \n\n   \n  One goal of that initiative, which is still in its early stages, is to reduce the uniformed lawyers’ presence at the Pentagon and instead send them out to the field to be more integrated into operations, a current official said.\n \n\n   \n  But Hegseth has also made his expectations clear to military lawyers embedded with commanders in the field, who often advise on the laws of armed conflict, the international legal framework that dictates how and when militaries can use force. Speaking to a room full of generals and admirals late last month, Hegseth derided “stupid rules of engagement,” and urged those assembled to get on board with his vision to “untie the hands of our war fighters.” He also said he wanted to raise the bar for troops to be investigated for misconduct.\n \n\n   \n  “The rule of law at DoD has been under attack since day one of this administration,” one of the current JAGs told CNN. “There is a real dismissiveness of lawyers now. And I fear for where this is all going.”\n \n\n   \n    Military lawyers wary of US strikes in Caribbean\n \n\n   \n  One recent flashpoint for the role of US military lawyers has been the series of strikes on boats in the Caribbean, with multiple current and former JAGs telling CNN that the strikes do not appear lawful. Lawyers specializing in international law within DoD’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes, sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the top international law expert in that office, Michael D’Annunzio, is set to leave his role soon and move to a position at NATO in Europe, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN. Former officials familiar with the matter said D’Annunzio has been left out of discussions surrounding the legality of the Caribbean strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Secretary of Defense didn’t respond to specific questions about D’Annunzio. But in a statement, Parnell said, “The War Department categorically denies that any Pentagon lawyers with knowledge of these operations have raised concerns regarding the legality of the strikes conducted thus far because they are aware we are on firm legal ground,” adding that there is a “robust system of internal checks and balances within the War Department that offers those involved in operations the opportunity to disagree.”\n \n\n   \n  “No lawyer involved has questioned the legality of the Caribbean strikes and instead advised subordinate commanders and Secretary Hegseth that the proposed actions were permissible before they commenced,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Department lawyers are now deferring to an opinion produced by the Justice Department which says that the president is legally permitted to order the deadly attacks on the boats based on an argument that the US is in the midst of an armed conflict with cartels, CNN has reported. Legal experts have r epeatedly questioned  the legality of the strikes, and the DOJ opinion has not been released publicly.\n \n\n   \n  A Navy JAG who is not directly involved in the decision making around the strikes told CNN that the policy has put some lawyers in a tenuous position.\n \n\n   \n  “The view is, you probably don’t want to stray too far away from what you know is correct,” this person said. That is because the time will inevitably come, they added, when a new administration with a different defense secretary will be in power. “And when that time comes, you don’t want to have evidence of you running too much afoul of what’s required by law.”\n \n\n   \n  JAG officers told CNN they’ve also been uncomfortable with the political events Trump has held at bases in recent months. Before Trump visited Fort Bragg in June, for example, the White House called the base and told officials the president wanted them to put on a parade with all 50,000 troops stationed there, a source familiar with the episode recalled.\n \n\n   \n  Uniformed lawyers strenuously advised against it, this source said, as  DoD policy  prohibits active-duty troops from participating in political events. Ultimately, it was deemed too short notice to put on such a huge parade. But pro-Trump political merchandise was sold on base during the event, which service members were photographed purchasing, and some troops cheered or jeered when the president touched on highly political issues — conduct the lawyers had also warned against beforehand.\n \n\n   \n  “They were ignored,” this source said. “Who is going to listen to them when they know the president wants to do something?”\n \n\n   \n  One change that Hegseth has made is, on its surface, relatively small. But current and former defense officials believe the secretary is also deliberately sidelining JAG leadership by installing two-star generals in those positions rather than three-stars.\n \n\n   \n  After 9/11, as Justice Department and White House lawyers advised the CIA and DoD that torturing detainees was in their view legally permissible in some instances as part of the war on terror, several JAGs were warning against it, Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham  told PBS  in 2007. But the top JAGs for each service were two-star generals and often not senior enough to be in the room for the highly sensitive discussions. As a result, they were largely being ignored by DOJ and White House lawyers, Graham, who served as an Air Force JAG for more than 30 years, said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Graham subsequently pushed, successfully, to elevate the JAGs’ rank. “I don’t want the military legal system having to answer unnecessarily to political appointees,” he said at the time. “I want them to be able to talk to their commanders, get independent input, to use their military legal experience in independent fashion for the good of the system.”\n \n\n   \n  But Hegseth effectively demoted them again. The Army, Navy and Air Force JAG positions are currently all held by two-star officers. Graham’s office did not respond when asked for his view on the demotions.\n \n\n   \n  The former senior defense official said the change is significant.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re a 2-star and you walk into the room for a high-level meeting, you’re against the wall. You’re not at the table. And there are some meetings that are held just at the 3 or 4 star level—so you can’t even get  into  the room as a 2-star.”\n \n\n   \n    Hegseth’s longstanding concerns about JAGs\n \n\n   \n  Much of Hegseth’s criticism of military lawyers stems from his experience serving as a platoon leader in Iraq in 2005, when by his own account he was given a briefing by JAGs in Baghdad whose advice was to refrain from shooting someone carrying a rocket-propelled grenade unless it was “pointed at you with the intent to fire.” Hegseth wrote that he told his platoon it was a “bullshit rule that’s going to get people killed.” He also wrote that he was “tasked with releasing Iraqi men who we knew had American blood on their hands. The jagoff lawyers told us we had to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Current and former officials familiar with Hegseth’s thinking, however, told CNN that the experience that arguably solidified his disdain the most was when his unit became ensnared in a war crimes investigation by Army lawyers that effectively ended the career of his commander at the time, Col. Michael Steele. Steele was not charged with a crime, but he  was formally reprimanded , making it unlikely he would ever be promoted again.\n \n\n   \n  While Hegseth was not involved in the operation that led to the war crimes allegations, which centered around the deaths of four unarmed Iraqi men in 2006, the ensuing probe resulted in serious jail time for several of those Hegseth had served with. It also left a cloud of suspicion hanging over several of his mentors and the unit as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  “The sad part was, the entire unit was painted as a bunch of bad guys and it was just not fair,” a former officer who served in the unit with Hegseth told CNN last year.  In 2019 Hegseth became a vocal advocate for at least three servicemembers who’d been either accused or convicted of war crimes.\n \n\n   \n  Parlatore, Hegseth’s lawyer who rejoined the Navy Reserve in March to help advise Hegseth in a more official capacity, said in a post on LinkedIn earlier this year that the JAGs’ legal recommendations carry too much weight while at the same time being shrouded in secrecy.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, [Staff Judge Advocates] recommend removal of O5 and O6 commanders with zero public explanation beyond a ‘loss of trust and confidence,’” he wrote. “There have been significant problems within the JAG Corps which require a serious course correction.”\n \n\n   \n  Other current and former JAGs, however, said they understand that their role is simply to advise, and that while they can formally record their dissent or opinion that an action is illegal, they also can’t stop a commander from moving forward with it.\n \n\n   \n  “Lawyers advise. Commanders decide,” the former senior defense official told CNN. “It’s just that simple.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated based on additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/seth-moulton-launches-senate-primary-ed-markey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:02:00-04:00","title":"Rep.

Seth Moulton invokes age in launching Democratic primary challenge against Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:02 AM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Invoking the specter of Joe Biden and decrying Democrats whom he says have “clung to the status quo, insisted on using the same old playbook – and isn’t fighting hard enough,” Rep. Seth Moulton launched a primary challenge on Wednesday against Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.\n \n\n   \n  Moulton, a 46-year-old six-term congressman who spent much of his early years in Congress leading  challenges  to then-House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, said he’s running because he doesn’t have faith in Markey — not to serve out another Senate term capably, and not to be able to lead the pushback to the current White House.\n \n\n   \n  “Democrats have failed to stop Donald Trump’s harmful, racist agenda,” Moulton says in his campaign  launch video . “The next generation will keep paying the cost if we don’t change course. This isn’t a fight we can put off for another six years. The future we all believe in is on the line. We’re in a crisis. And with everything we learned in the last election, I just don’t believe Senator Markey should be running for another six-year term at 80 years old.”\n \n\n   \n  Markey was a longtime member of the House before winning a special election for what had been John Kerry’s Senate seat in 2013. He won a full term the following year, and then another in 2020 despite a primary challenge from then-Rep. Joe Kennedy III – the first time a member of the Kennedy dynasty had ever lost in the state. In that race, Markey was embraced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York for their collaboration on the Green New Deal and was suddenly turned into a hero of that wing of the party.\n \n\n   \n  Other Massachusetts politicians considered taking on Markey this year, with several looking at internal polling showing him vulnerable in the solidly Democratic state where the primary winner would be heavily favored to win the seat. Fellow Rep. Ayanna Pressley has also been rumored to be looking at a possible run.\n \n\n   \n  Several Democrats in their 70s and 80s are facing primary challenges or retiring after younger Democrats announced bids against them explicitly over age. First elected in 1976, Markey is the longest serving current Democrat in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  “The old playbook isn’t working, so this is exactly the debate Democrats need to have right now,” Moulton told CNN earlier this week. “Personally, I don’t get saying we want to build the future while recycling leadership from the past. Voters are asking for new energy, new ideas, and leadership that fights like hell against Trump but also lays out a positive vision for America.”\n \n\n   \n  In his video, which in a clear effort to show his vitality is largely presented with a camera mounted on him as he goes on a run, Moulton references an experience from when he served in the Marine Corps, when at the end of a battle he found a fellow Marine dead, and thought if he’d gotten there a little earlier, the man would not have died alone.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s why I won’t wait to help people who need help right now,” Moulton says. “It’s why I won’t wait to do the hard thing and call out what’s not working in our own party. And it’s why we can’t wait to protect our families from Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.”\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Ed Markey had initially been appointed to his seat. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/entertainment/tyra-banks-hot-ice-cream","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00.000Z","title":"Tyra Banks is launching ‘hot ice cream’ and the internet is a bit cold about it","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tyra Banks, the former supermodel and entrepreneur, is launching a new dessert product called 'Hot Mama,' a sippable, warm, liquid version of ice cream that is not melted but intentionally warmed and churned to create a creamy, dreamy texture.

Tyra Banks is about to test that out.\n \n\n   \n  The former supermodel turned entrepreneur has announced she’s launching hot ice cream. If you are wondering what that is exactly, you are not alone.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do know: Banks has an ice cream company company called Smize & Dream that has a shop in Australia.\n \n\n   \n   According to the site,  she came up with the idea in honor of her mother, Carolyn London.\n \n\n   \n  “During Mama’s hard working years, every Friday night after homework and dinner, we’d have girls night at the Häagen Dazs ice cream shop in Hollywood!,” Banks explained on the site. “While licking our chocolate (her fave) and coffee (my fave) ice creams in her white Honda Accord, in her cray-cray-in a-good-way style, she’d school me on her laser-focused one-more-bedroom goals and more. We’d laugh, cry and DREAM our biggest, most outrageous CREATIVE DREAMS… together.”\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward decades later and Banks is a star best known for not only modeling, but also her reality show “America’s Next Top Model.”\n \n\n   \n  Recently she announced what she calls “the world’s first HOT ice cream experience.”\n \n\n   \n  “Not a latte. Not a hot chocolate,” Banks  wrote on social media.  “But your favorite scoops, transformed into liquid. hot. ice cream.

We loved Baba so much, he was the defender of the people,” said Beatrice Adala, one of many who went to the airport. Like many, she called Odinga “Baba,” a Kiswahili honorific usually reserved for a beloved father figure.\n \n\n   \n  The politician, who was lauded for his fight for democracy, died Wednesday at 80 years old after he collapsed during a morning walk.

          Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 4:02 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday called on Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end their brutal war following a lengthy White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's frustration with the conflict has surfaced repeatedly in the nine months since he returned to office, but with his latest comments he edged back in the direction of pressing Ukraine to give up on retaking land it has lost to Russia. \"Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post not long after hosting Zelenskyy and his team for more than two hours of talks. \"They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" Later, soon after arriving in Florida, where he's spending the weekend, Trump urged both sides to \"stop the war immediately\" and implied that Moscow keep territory it's taken from Kyiv. \"You go by the battle line wherever it is — otherwise it's too complicated,\" Trump told reporters. \"You stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it.\" The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by Trump. In recent weeks, he had shown growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war. After meeting with Zelenskyy in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly last month, Trump even said he believed the Ukrainians could win back all the the territory they had lost to Russia since Putin launched the February 2022 invasion. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who had previously insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Zelenskyy after Friday's meeting said it was time for a ceasefire and negotiations. He sidestepped directly answering a question about Trump nudging Ukraine to give up land. \"The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak,\" Zelenskyy said when asked by reporters about Trump's social media post, which he hadn't seen. Another change in tone Trump's tone on the war shifted after he held a lengthy phone call with Putin on Thursday and announced that he planned to meet with the Russian leader in Budapest, Hungary, in the coming weeks. The president also signaled to Zelenskyy on Friday that he's leaning against selling him long-range Tomahawk missiles, weaponry that the Ukrainians believe could be a game changer in helping prod Putin to the negotiating table. Zelenskyy at the start of the White House talks said he had a \"proposition\" in which Ukraine could provide the United States with its advanced drones, while Washington would sell Kyiv the Tomahawk cruise missiles. But Trump said he was hesitant to tap into the U.S. supply, a turnabout after days of suggesting he was seriously weighing sending the missiles to help Ukraine beat back Russia's invasion. \"I have an obligation also to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace,\" Trump said. \"We'd much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We'd much rather have the war be over to be honest.\" In an interview with Kristen Welker of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Zelenskyy suggested the door was not closed. \"It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'\" he said. Zelenskyy also said \"we need Tomahawks\" because \"it's very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.\" Trump's latest rhetoric on Tomahawks was certainly disappointing to the Ukrainians. In recent days, Trump had shown an openness to selling Ukraine the Tomahawks, even as Putin warned that such a move would further strain the U.S.-Russian relationship. Why Tomahawks? But following Thursday's call with Putin, Trump began downplaying the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.) Zelenskyy had been seeking the Tomahawks, which would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deep into Russian territory and target key military sites, energy facilities and critical infrastructure. Zelenskyy has argued that the potential for such strikes would help compel Putin to take Trump's calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously. Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with the Tomahawks \"won't change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries,\" according to Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser. It was the fifth face-to-face meeting for Trump and Zelenskyy since the Republican returned to office in January, The president said Friday it was \"to be determined\" if Zelenskyy would be involved in the upcoming talks in Hungary — suggesting a \"double meeting\" with the warring countries' leaders was likely the most workable option for productive negotiations. \"These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump added. But Zelenskyy told reporters that the animus toward Putin \"is not about feelings.\" \"They attacked us, so they are an enemy for us. They don't intend to stop,\" Zelenskyy added. \"So they are an enemy. It is not about someone just hating someone else. Although, undoubtedly, we hate the enemy. Undoubtedly.\" Trump, going back to his 2024 campaign, insisted he would quickly end the war, but his peace efforts appeared to stall following a diplomatic blitz in August, when he held a summit with Putin in Alaska and a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European allies. Trump emerged from those meetings certain he was on track to arranging direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin.

Senators will force a vote to prevent war on Venezuela without approval from Congress \n         By Claudia Grisales \n        \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Amid a wave of U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean and plans for covert operations in Venezuela, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote to stop President Trump from unilaterally declaring war on the South American nation. Kaine, a longtime proponent of Congress' powers to declare war, filed the resolution late Thursday, a move that will force the Senate to take up the legislation after a 10-day waiting period. Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., co-sponsored the plan.  Kaine said concerns about war in the Latin American region are growing. \"The pace of the announcements, the authorization of covert activities and the military planning makes me think there's some chance this could be imminent,\" Kaine told reporters.  This week, Trump said the U.S. had conducted another military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean and announced that he had  authorized CIA operations  in Venezuela. He also said he was considering land operations in the country.   \"We've almost totally stopped it by sea. Now we'll stop it by land,\" Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday about alleged drug smuggling.  Last week, Kaine and Schiff forced a Senate vote to limit Trump's war powers in the Caribbean. While  that vote failed 48-51 , two Republicans, Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Democrats in support. Paul has been a vocal critic of the new military strikes, saying they set a precedent for the U.S. to shoot first without asking questions. \"The American people do not want to be dragged into endless war with Venezuela without public debate or a vote,\" Paul said in a statement. \"We ought to defend what the Constitution demands: deliberation before war.\" Kaine, Paul and Schiff are hoping more Republican members will vote in favor of the new limits. Several Republicans have voted for other war powers and use of military force resolutions led by Kaine in the past. \"I think it's probably 10 or so [Republicans] who voted yes on at least one of them,\" he said. \"So we'll start to work that.\" It remains unclear whether there are enough Republican votes for the measure to succeed.  Kaine said Congress continues to face a \"black hole\" of information related to action against Venezuela. Lawmakers say the administration still has not shared evidence to justify the boat strikes, which Kaine and others believe are illegal and unconstitutional. Since September, Trump has ordered at least five U.S. military strikes on boats that the administration has claimed were smuggling illegal drugs. So far, at least 27 people have been reported killed, but their identities have yet to be shared. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5574349","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Does the sale of Dominion Voting Systems mean a transformation?

Depends who's asking \n         By Miles Parks, Bente Birkeland \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When Scott Leiendecker announced he was buying Dominion Voting Systems — the elections technology company at the heart of countless 2020 election  conspiracy theories  — he teased a transformation. \"As of today, Dominion is gone,\" read the first line of a press release that seemed to many readers to  lean into  the unfounded rumors that have swirled around the company (and led to  hundreds of millions of dollars  in defamation settlements) since Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election. \"We are turning the page and beginning the vital work of restoring faith in American elections,\" Leiendecker wrote in a public letter posted on the website for his new company, Liberty Vote. But in private, when speaking to the company's county election official customers, the messaging has been different, raising the question of how much the company plans to change. \"Feel assured that Liberty Vote shares the same values as Dominion,\" company representatives in Georgia, which has a statewide contract with the company, wrote in an email that NPR reviewed that was sent to counties after the sale was announced. \"Same team, same support, different name.\" In Colorado, where Dominion was headquartered and where 60 of 64 counties have a contract with the company, Molly Fitzpatrick, who's the Democratic Boulder County clerk, talked with Leiendecker shortly after the sale and helped facilitate another call to include every clerk in the state. \"He reiterated that he is an elections person and he has a long track record of being involved in elections,\" Fitzpatrick said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After serving as a Republican elections director in St. Louis 20 years ago, Leiendecker started a company, KNOWiNK, in 2011 that has become the United States' largest vendor for voter check-in technology. And while the message on Liberty Vote's website notes KNOWiNK's ubiquity in U.S. elections, the Liberty Vote press release doesn't mention KNOWiNK and paints Leiendecker as more of an outsider, referring to him as a \"nationally recognized election reform advocate.\" Leiendecker did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. A press release's partisan tone The press release announcing the Dominion sale nodded at conservative election priorities, highlighting Liberty Vote's 100% American ownership and a mission to \"restore public confidence in the electoral process through transparent, secure, and trustworthy voting systems, including the use of hand-marked paper ballots.\" Liberty Vote also promised to comply with Trump's March executive order on election security, which has  largely been paused by federal judges . David Becker, who runs the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said that he couldn't remember an election vendor ever seeking out publicity in the way Liberty Vote did and that the partisan tone of the announcement may generate even more suspicion around the company than existed before. \"I thought the announcement was weird — I'll be honest,\" Becker said. \"That just raised a lot of questions on the part of election officials. They're already under siege. There is already so much disinformation swirling about voting systems and their security. … They don't want drama around their voting systems.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some in the voting world see the difference in the public and private messaging as more of a rebrand aimed at capitalizing on doubts that people have about elections, rather than transforming the company into a partisan entity. As one state voting official, who was not authorized to speak about the sale publicly, put it to NPR: \"[Leiendecker] sees an opportunity to sell Dominion to all the conservative jurisdictions who wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole the past five years.\" \"It's all business for him,\" the official said. \"Is this a GOP takeover?\" Some Colorado clerks were frustrated they were given no notice before the sale was made public. \"There was no notification to us that this was even a conversation,\" said Tiffany Lee, the politically unaffiliated clerk of La Plata County, in southwest Colorado. \"That's concerning to me that we didn't get any kind of information from [Liberty Vote] directly or Dominion.\" The announcement — along with Leiendecker's history as a Republican elections official — raised questions for some voters as well, Lee said: \"It was, 'Is this a GOP takeover? Are elections going away? What's happening?' Probably one of the biggest questions I've overall gotten is, 'Are we gonna continue to have elections?'\" Lee and other election officials are urging calm, considering that nothing about the equipment used to scan and count votes is even changing in the short term. In most cases, voters whose ballots were tallied using Dominion technology in 2024 will have their votes counted in the 2026 midterms using the same machines. \"From a security and technical perspective, everything still stands,\" Fitzpatrick, the Boulder County clerk, said. \"We still have multiple checks and balances to demonstrate and verify the integrity of the system. Everything that we have been saying for years is still the same.\" The sale may not satisfy conspiracy theorists Like  most of the country , Colorado is a paper-ballot state, and by law, all Colorado counties conduct risk-limiting audits after each election, double-checking the scanning machines' tallies against the actual votes on the original paper ballots. While audits and hand counts have shown that the state's election results are accurate, Colorado has been at the  epicenter of false election claims . That fact has many wondering whether a marketing campaign can actually win the buy-in of those convinced that Dominion was involved in stealing elections. Indeed, after the sale was announced, conservative activist and podcaster Joe Oltmann, a prominent election denier based in Colorado, blasted Leiendecker in a Facebook post. \"This guy is not a conservative... I truly hate what our country has become... it is literally a cartel that wear[s] different badges while stealing the voice in a sea of treason,\" posted Oltmann.

Andrew, 65, denies any wrongdoing, but  stepped back  from royal duties in 2019, over his Epstein links. He was  stripped of royal patronages  and military titles in 2022. This week, British media  published excerpts  of a posthumous memoir by Epstein's best-known accuser, Virginia Giuffre, who says she had sex with the prince when she was 17. Andrew denies that, and  settled a lawsuit  with Giuffre in 2022. She died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement issued by the palace late Friday, Andrew says the \"continued accusations… distract from the work of His Majesty\" King Charles. So after \"discussion\" with the king and their \"wider family,\" Andrew says he will \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me.\" He added that he \"vigorously\" denies the accusations against him.

Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Friday, saying he had signed a commutation to release Santos from prison immediately. Joseph Murray, one of Santos' lawyers,  told The Associated Press  that the former lawmaker was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, N.J. Jersey, around 11 p.m. Friday, and was greeted by his family. \"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote. Santos, a fierce supporter of Trump, pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Santos was responsible for a \"mountain of lies, theft, and fraud\" aimed at enriching himself and deceiving campaign donors. He began his sentence in July of this year. Soon after Santos was elected in 2020, reports that he had fabricated numerous aspects of his identity began to trickle out. He later admitted to lying about his education, employment and his upbringing. Santos was still sworn into Congress in 2022 despite the inconsistencies raised about his background and campaign finances. His falsehoods would catch up with him less than a year after his term began. In 2023, the House voted 311-114  to remove him from office . Almost every Democrat and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos. The vote made Santos just the sixth representative to ever be expelled from the chamber but the first to be expelled without being convicted of a crime. At the time of his expulsion, Santos  was facing 23 criminal charges . Trump compared Santos' crimes to claims made by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., more than 15 years ago  about his military service . Blumenthal has previously admitted that he \"misspoke\" about serving in Vietnam. Blumenthal served six years in the Marine Reserve beginning in 1970, but none of that time was spent overseas. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote. So far during his second term, Trump has issued a slew of high-profile pardons and commutations. He issued a blanket pardon of  more than 1,500 people  charged with acts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich also received  a pardon  after he was convicted on a series of corruption-related crimes, including trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama. Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence during his first term. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5578266","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"19:29:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration asks Supreme Court to allow National Guard deployment in Illinois","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, arguing that federal personnel face imminent danger due to lawlessness in Chicago.

As legal challenges to President Trump's  push to send military troops to Democratic-led cities  make their way through several courts, the administration's appeal to the high court marks the first time the justices have been asked to weigh in on the issue. In the appeal filed on Friday by the Department of Justice, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that troops are needed in the Chicago area to \"prevent ongoing and intolerable risks to the lives and safety\" of federal agents. The appeal comes a day after a federal judge  denied Trump's bid to deploy troops in Illinois . Sauer argued that the judge's ruling \"improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.\" Trump has been arguing that Chicago is lawless and in need of military intervention to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities, and federalized the state National Guard against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's wishes earlier this month. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also sent several hundred of his state's troops to the Democratic-led state. The Trump administration is \"going to litigate this as much as we can,\" Vice President JD Vance said  in an interview  with ABC's  This Week  on Sunday. \"We think that we have the authority to provide proper safety to our citizens all over the United States, but particularly in Chicago.\" The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the administration's arguments by Monday evening. President Trump has carried out, or attempted to carry out, similar plans in other cities while claiming that federal intervention is needed to drive down crime rates. Leaders in several of those cities have said military force is unnecessary and have accused the president of exceeding his authority to carry out such deployments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The president is currently in  a legal battle  with the state of California, after he deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protests. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has argued that Trump broke the law by not consulting with Gov. Gavin Newsom.  Last month,  Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were \"tremendous levels\" of crime in the city. He is also in litigation with the city of Portland, Ore., after attempting to send troops there to  safeguard ICE facilities that he said were being attacked . A judge has issued an order blocking the deployment.  In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month. Shortly before the emergency expired, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the city had established the  Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center  to manage and continue its relationship with federal law enforcement. The office is responsible, in part, for communicating D.C.'s requests to the federal agents, such as that they not wear masks and that they clearly identify themselves during arrests and interactions with the public.  Trump, eyeing future troop deployments, has said Baltimore, New York, New Orleans, St. Louis, Mo., Oakland and San Francisco are next.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5566732","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:52:00-04:00","title":"The test for U.S. citizenship is about to get harder","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to the U.S. naturalization process, making the civics oral exam more difficult by requiring applicants to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly—double the previous threshold.

get harder \n         By Adrian Florido \n        \n           Thursday, October 16, 2025 • 3:52 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is making it harder to pass the oral exam required for immigrants seeking naturalization as U.S. citizens.   The new test is also longer. Green card holders who file for citizenship after Oct. 20 will have to answer twice as many questions correctly during the civics interview that tests their knowledge of U.S. history, politics and government and that is one of the final steps in the naturalization process. The list of possible questions will also get longer and include more difficult questions. A spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Matthew Tragesser, said in  a statement  when the changes were announced recently that the new test will ensure \"that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" It's just one of several changes the Trump administration has instituted to make citizenship harder to earn as it seeks more broadly to limit the ability of immigrants and visa holders to enter, remain or settle in the U.S. The citizenship test that USCIS has used  since 2008  requires applicants to answer six questions correctly out of 10. The  new test  will require 12 correct answers out of 20. The list of possible questions the agent chooses from will grow from 100 to 128, and many will be more difficult. Questions about U.S. holidays and geography and others with short answers – \"What ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?\" – are being reduced or eliminated, and replaced with tougher ones: \"Why did the United States enter the Persian Gulf War?\" (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To force the Iraqi military from Kuwait.\") Another new question: Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War? (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To stop the spread of communism.\") Aside from the tougher civics test, applicants for citizenship will also have to convince an immigration officer that they have \"good moral character.\" Until now, the absence of bad behavior or criminal conduct on an applicant's record has been enough. Now, they'll need to submit evidence of their \"positive contributions to American society.\" Immigration officers will also more rigorously check applicants' backgrounds, possibly interviewing co-workers, family members or neighbors. Advocates who help people prepare for the citizenship test say the changes present more obstacles in an already challenging and cumbersome process. \"It's hard to imagine that these changes don't have a negative impact on the number of people who are able to continue the naturalization process,\" said Julie Mitchell, legal director of the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles, which offers citizenship courses. \"Particularly considering that these changes will impact individuals with low literacy levels and those who don't have access to classes and preparation materials.\" She said the naturalization process could also become more uncertain, because it's unclear what standards immigration officers will use to assess \"good moral character.\" Speaking in Washington  last month , USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said that the current test is \"just too easy\" because some questions require simple answers, like naming the governor of an applicant's home state, or two federal holidays. \"We need to know more,\" Edlow said. \"Especially if we're going to really understand whether someone has a true attachment to the Constitution as required by the statute.\" But Amanda Frost, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and the author of  You Are Not American , a book about the history of citizenship stripping, said that while requiring applicants for citizenship to jump over hurdles is appropriate, there's no proof that the existing naturalization process is falling short. \"Has there been any evidence that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share our values, and don't make for good participants in our democracy?\" Frost asked. \"I don't see any evidence of that.\" She notes that nearly  half of all Fortune 500  companies were founded by immigrants or their children. \"Those who naturalize, and their children, thrive in the United States, and have benefited this country,\" Frost said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The Trump administration is making it harder for immigrants to become naturalized U.S. citizens. Starting next week, it is rolling out changes to the civics test that candidates for citizenship are required to pass. This is one of several changes the administration says are aimed at making sure new U.S. citizens are - in its words - fully assimilated. We're joined now by NPR's Adrian Florido. And Adrian, just explain the process here. The civics test is the last - one of the last steps in the naturalization process. Applicants go into an immigration office. They get asked a bunch of questions by the agent. If they pass, they usually earn their citizenship. And that process is not changing, right? ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: That's right, Mary Louise. That process is staying the same. What is changing is that applicants will now have to answer more questions correctly to pass that test. So with the current test, they have to get right 6 out of 10 questions that the agent asks them. They'll now have to get twice as many right - 12 out of up to 20 possible questions. And the list of possible questions that they will have to study from is also going to get quite a lot longer, so there'll be a lot more answers to memorize before you go in for the test. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, is also eliminating what are seen as easier questions on this test - so those about geography. For example, what ocean is on the West Coast of the U.S.? That question is out, and it's being replaced with questions like, why did the U.S. enter the Persian Gulf War? The right answer, according to the government, is - was to force the Iraqi military from Kuwait. The idea, Mary Louise, is to make this test harder to pass. KELLY: And why do this? Why does the Trump administration say these changes are needed? FLORIDO: Well, USCIS has said that they're about restoring, quote, \"integrity\" to the naturalization process. They're saying that the test is too easy. But these changes also reflect broader principles that President Trump has embraced about, you know, what it means to be a good American. A USCIS spokesman said in a statement that U.S. citizenship should only be for people who, quote, \"fully embrace our values and principles as a nation.\" And he said that this new test will ensure that new citizens are, quote, \"fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" The naturalization process is also changing in other ways, Mary Louise. USCIS is requiring applicants to prove that they are of, quote, \"good moral character\" by providing evidence of positive contributions that they've made to the U.S. And immigration officers are also going to do more rigorous background checks on applicants, including possibly interviewing their coworkers, neighbors or family members. KELLY: So go back to something we just heard in that statement from the immigration official - the term fully assimilated. What does that mean? FLORIDO: You know, it's not new that the naturalization process requires a certain amount of integration, or you might say assimilation, into U.S. society. Most applicants have to speak English well enough to answer questions about U.S. history and government, for example. But the government is now saying that the bar is too low. I asked University of Virginia law professor Amanda Frost, who wrote a book about citizenship called \"You Are Not American\" - I asked her for her take on that claim. AMANDA FROST: Has there been any evidence that we have held that standard too low - that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share values, don't make for good participants in our democracy and our society? And I would say I don't see any evidence of that. Those that naturalize and their children thrive in the United States and have benefited this country. KELLY: Well, so Adrian, what are the possible consequences of these changes? FLORIDO: Well, it's becoming harder to earn U.S. citizenship. And one big question about these questions, Mary Louise, is whether they'll drive down naturalization rates.

motivated by notoriety over ideology \n         By Caroline Love \n        \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 4:47 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         DALLAS– A newly released police report offers personal details of the person responsible for  last month's shooting  at a Dallas Immigration facility that killed two detainees and injured another, and experts think he may have been motivated more by notoriety than ideology. The parents of Joshua Jahn, who died by suicide, told local police their 29-year-old son was a \"loner,\" according to a Fairview police report recently obtained by NPR. Fairview is a suburb north of Dallas, where he was living with his parents. According to the incident report, Jahn was unemployed and didn't have friends or a romantic partner. The parents told the police Jahn \"spent much of his time on his computer playing games and was 'obsessed' with AI technology.\" They said Jahn rarely engaged in conversation and that they \"were generally not aware of his daily activities.\" The shooting at the Dallas Immigration and Customs field office was the second shooting at an ICE facility in North Texas in recent months. All of  those killed  were immigrants who were in ICE custody. Jahn left a note saying the attack was aimed at ICE agents, law enforcement said at a press conference the day after the shooting. Assigning Blame Acting U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson said at a press conference a day after the shooting that Jahn likely acted alone and wasn't affiliated with a particular group or entity. Public records from Oklahoma, where Jahn voted in the 2024 general election, indicate he was a  registered independent . Jahn's brother Noah told  NBC News  he didn't think Jahn was interested in politics. Still, several conservative elected and government officials point to his actions as an example of far left extremism. The actual political philosophy of individuals who commit this kind of violence can be difficult to label. Oftentimes, their views are a hodgepodge from both the left and right, said Rachel Kleinfeld, a political violence expert and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment's Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program. \"These shooters tend to want to use violence as a way of making their lives meaningful,\" Kleinfeld said. \"They often feel like their lives are really insignificant, unimportant. But if they commit an act of violence, they'll be appreciated by one side or another.\" \"Me and my brain\" Larson said FBI agents found a  collection of notes  at Jahn's home in Fairview where he took sole credit for the attack. One note said \"yes, it was just me and my brain.\" Another said, \"good luck with the digital footprint.\" The FBI office in Dallas told NPR it's unable to comment on the investigation at this time because of the ongoing government shutdown. For someone who's desperate to feel heard, any kind of infamy can be attractive, said Jon Lewis, a  research fellow  at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. \"A lot of these individuals who are so deep in these hyper-violence, really just dehumanizing online spaces, the idea of committing that very public act of violence is appealing,\" Lewis said. \"It gives them a way to get their name out, to become someone who matters.\" Lewis said that ideology isn't the point for online forums that promote extremism \"Violence for the sake of violence can do the job,\" he said. Social Isolation People who commit acts of political violence are often socially isolated. And many struggle with their mental health. Jahn's parents told Fairview police he wasn't being treated for or diagnosed with any mental health conditions. Jahn, who was born and raised in Allen, Texas, was described in the report \"completely normal\" until he returned from living in Washington state four or five years ago, according to the Fairview police incident report. Kleinfeld said perpetrators of public violence are struggling with their sense of self and are looking for a target for their aggression. \"People who commit ideological violence tend to have had an identity disturbance in their life,\" she said. \"They're not quite sure who they are, and they're searching for a new identity.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Three weeks ago, a gunman opened fire on a Dallas immigration office, killing two detainees and injuring another. Several conservative elected officials have called the shooter a violent leftist, but new details show the shooting may be more about notoriety than ideology. Caroline Love from member station KERA in Dallas reports. CAROLINE LOVE, BYLINE: Joshua Jahn's parents told local police their son was a, quote, \"loner\" who spent most of his time playing online games, according to an incident report recently obtained by NPR. The 29-year-old lived with his parents on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in Fairview, a suburb north of Dallas. His parents told Fairview police their son didn't have friends or a romantic partner and rarely engaged in conversation. This was the second shooting at an ICE facility in north Texas. All those injured were immigrants who were in ICE custody. Law enforcement says Jahn left a note saying the attack was aimed at ICE agents. One of the shell casings found at the scene had the inscription, anti-ICE. His brother told NBC News he didn't think Jahn was interested in politics. Several conservative elected officials have blamed the left's criticism of ICE for the attack. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JD VANCE: Because here's what happens when Democrats, like Gavin Newsom did, say that these people are part of an authoritarian government. LOVE: That was Vice President JD Vance at an event in North Carolina after the Dallas shooting. The ideology of individuals who commit this kind of violence can be difficult to label. Rachel Kleinfeld is a political violence expert and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Kleinfeld says they often have a hodgepodge of political views. RACHEL KLEINFELD: These shooters tend to want to use violence as a way of making their lives meaningful. LOVE: Jon Lewis from George Washington University's program on extremism says any infamy can be attractive for someone desperate to leave a legacy, even if it's controversial. And he says the internet amplifies the lure of notoriety. JON LEWIS: For a lot of these individuals who are so deep in these hyperviolent, really just dehumanizing online spaces, the idea of committing that very public act of violence is appealing. LOVE: People who commit acts of political violence are often socially isolated, and many struggle with their mental health. Jahn's parents told police he wasn't being treated for or diagnosed with any mental health conditions. Jahn was born and raised in Allen, Texas. According to the police report, his behavior changed after he moved home after living in Washington state four or five years ago. Jahn died by suicide after he shot the detainees at the Dallas ICE field office. Kleinfeld says perpetrators of public attacks are struggling with their sense of self and are looking for a target for their aggression. And they're hearing a lot about politics in the media and from family and friends. KLEINFELD: People who commit ideological violence tend to have had an identity disturbance in their life. They're not quite sure who they are, and they're searching for a new identity. LOVE: Back in Fairview, Jahn's neighbor, Sherry Davis (ph), expressed shock that someone from her quiet suburban community would commit such a heinous act. SHERRY DAVIS: I would have never imagined that such a thing - you know, someone that felt so disenfranchised would live so close to me. LOVE: And experts warn, for socially isolated individuals whose only connections are online spaces that glorify violence, the infamy shooters like Jahn gain could be alluring.

the Los Angeles Dodgers back to the World Series with a two-way performance for the ages. Ohtani hit three mammoth homers and struck out 10 while pitching shutout ball into the seventh inning, and the Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Brewers out of the National League Championship Series with a 5-1 victory in Game 4 on Friday night. \"That was probably the greatest postseason performance of all time,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"There's been a lot of postseason games. And there's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Dodgers will have a chance to become baseball's first repeat World Series champions in a quarter-century after this mind-blowing night for the three-time MVP, who emphatically ended a quiet postseason by his lofty standards. Ohtani was selected the NLCS MVP essentially on the strength of this one unforgettable game. \"This time around it was my turn to be able to perform,\" he said through his interpreter. After striking out three in the top of the first inning, Ohtani hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history off Brewers starter Jose Quintana. Ohtani followed with a 469-foot drive in the fourth, clearing a pavilion roof in right-center. He added a third solo shot in the seventh, becoming the 12th big league player to hit three homers in a postseason game. His three homers traveled a combined 1,342 feet. Ohtani also thoroughly dominated the Brewers in his second career postseason start on the mound, allowing two hits in his first double-digit strikeout game in a Dodgers uniform. He didn't allow a hit until the fourth, and he fanned two Brewers in the fourth, fifth and sixth. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,\" said teammate Freddie Freeman, last season's World Series MVP. \"Absolutely incredible. Biggest stage, and he goes out and does something like that. It'll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani game.\" After the Brewers' first two batters reached in the seventh, Ohtani left the mound to a stadium-shaking ovation — and after Alex Vesia escaped the jam, Ohtani celebrated by hitting his third homer in the bottom half. The powerhouse Dodgers are the first team to win back-to-back pennants since Philadelphia in 2009. Los Angeles is back in the World Series for the fifth time in nine seasons, and it will attempt to become baseball's first repeat champs since the New York Yankees won three straight World Series from 1998 to 2000. \"That was special,\" Freeman said. \"We've just been playing really good baseball for a while now, and the inevitable kind of happened today — Shohei. Oh my God. I'm still speechless.\" Following a 9-1 rampage through the NL playoffs, the Dodgers are headed to the World Series for the 23rd time in franchise history, including 14 pennants since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Only the Yankees, last year's opponent, have made more appearances in the Fall Classic (41). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Los Angeles will have a week off before the World Series begins next Friday, either in Toronto or at Dodger Stadium against Seattle. The Mariners beat the Blue Jays 6-2 earlier Friday to take a 3-2 lead in the ALCS, which continues Sunday at Rogers Centre. The Dodgers had never swept an NLCS in 16 previous appearances, but they became only the fifth team to sweep this series while thoroughly dominating a Milwaukee club that led the major leagues with 97 wins during the season. Los Angeles is the first team to sweep a best-of-seven postseason series since 2022, and the first to sweep an NLCS since Washington in 2019. \"Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,\" Roberts shouted to the crowd during the on-field celebration. \"Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!\" The NL Central champion Brewers were eliminated by the Dodgers for the third time during their current stretch of seven playoff appearances in eight years. Even after setting a franchise record for wins this season, Milwaukee is still waiting for its first World Series appearance since 1982. \"We were part of tonight an iconic, maybe the best individual performance ever in a postseason game,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. \"I don't think anybody can argue with that. A guy punches out 10 and hits three homers.\" The Brewers had never been swept in a playoff series longer than a best-of-three, but their bats fell silent in the NLCS against the Dodgers' brilliant starting rotation. Los Angeles' four starters combined to pitch 28 2/3 innings with two earned runs allowed and 35 strikeouts. \"I really think that to beat us four games in a row, you've got to do a lot of things right,\" outfielder Blake Perkins said. \"Some things had to go their way that didn't go our way. We hit a lot of balls at people. But either way, Ohtani did great today. Is he the greatest player ever? I don't know. But he sure seemed like it tonight.\" The Dodgers added two more runs in the first after Ohtani's tone-setting homer, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith both singling and scoring. Jackson Chourio doubled leading off the fourth for Milwaukee's first hit, but Ohtani stranded him. Struggling Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen allowed two more baserunners in the eighth, and Caleb Durbin scored when Brice Turang beat out his potential double-play grounder before Anthony Banda ended the inning. Roki Sasaki pitched the ninth in the latest successful relief outing for the Dodgers' unlikely rookie closer. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577974","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:02:00-04:00","title":"What we know about the devastating storm in Western Alaska","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late October 2025, a remnant of Typhoon Halong struck the remote Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in Western Alaska, causing hurricane-force winds and record flooding that devastated coastal villages like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok.

about the devastating storm in Western Alaska \n         By Sage Smiley \n        \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 4:02 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In the late night hours of Oct. 11, the remnant of Typhoon Halong slammed Alaska's southwest coast, bringing hurricane-force winds and record flooding to numerous Alaska Native villages on the coast. Evacuees and rescuers describe massive destruction: utility poles snapped in half, boardwalks – the roads and sidewalks in many tundra villages – uprooted, houses floated off their foundations, some with families still inside. According to the state, more than a thousand people are displaced – some have no home to return to. One woman was  found dead , and  two of her family members remain missing . The state of Alaska's Emergency Operations Center is in its highest-possible level of emergency response. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has called for a federal disaster declaration for the region. Where is most affected? The remnant of Typhoon Halong had  sweeping impacts  across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta – an area in Western Alaska hundreds of miles from the U.S. road system and about the size of Oregon, with dozens of small villages scattered throughout. The coastal villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok took the brunt of the storm, and are being almost  entirely evacuated , per the State Emergency Operations Center. In addition, regional health officials have listed more than a dozen villages where  substantial damage  has been reported, and the state says that nearly 50 have reported some impacts. Damages are still being assessed and it's not clear yet how many people will be permanently displaced. Evacuations slowed and complicated by remoteness  Initially, many of the displaced  sheltered in schools throughout the region . But with heating, fuel, water, and sewer systems strained –  local officials said  it wasn't safe for people to stay. Emergency responders started to evacuate people to Bethel, the 6,500-person hub community of the region, which saw comparatively little damage from the storm. But the emergency shelter there reached capacity quickly. Within two days, displaced residents were being  flown to Anchorage,  400 air miles away. The evacuation process was significantly slowed by the remoteness of the area. With runways damaged in at least one village, some evacuations had to rely on helicopters. U.S. Coast Guard rescue crews  recounted moving people out of communities  six at a time. Buggy Carl, tribal administrator in Kipnuk, said despite the damage, it's daunting for community members to leave the place they have such deep history. The villages of the Kuskokwim Delta are the traditional homelands of  generations of Yup'ik people . \"I know their mindset, that their heart is here,\" he said on Oct. 15. \"They don't know anywhere else to go, because, you know, they grew up here. They have their own food throughout the year long, doing subsistence hunting. They just can't leave.\" That connection to land and food is a primary concern for many facing longer-term relocation. Some who've stayed behind in destroyed villages have done so with the goal of salvaging what subsistence foods they could – moose, musk ox, beluga, salmonberries, salmon, seal oil, emperor goose. Others speak of the heart-wrenching loss of ancestors' graves. In Kwigillingok, residents reported seeing unearthed coffins piled up at the end of the airport runway after the floodwaters receded. How was this typhoon remnant so destructive? Initially, climate models showed the remnant typhoon tracking north. But  according to Rick Thoman , an Alaska Climate Specialist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the storm picked up speed and shifted suddenly, taking its path right toward the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast. That was only a day and a half before the storm reached Alaska waters – a tight timeline for evacuation. This region is also on the forefront of climate change. Permafrost – or ground that is frozen year-round – underpins many of these villages and is thawing, leading to rapid erosion and instability. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium says nearly  150 communities  in Alaska – many in the Y-K Delta – will need to relocate fully or partially in the coming years because of permafrost thaw, land subsidence, erosion, or some other combination of climate-driven factors. The hundreds of square miles of tundra of the Delta are very close to sea level, and many communities don't have much high ground. And while some homes and buildings are built on pilings driven deep into the ground, many others sit on posts or other less stable foundations. These factors combine to make the land more vulnerable to storm-driven erosion, and structures more vulnerable to flood damage. What's next? If communities choose to rebuild, it will be difficult. It's expensive, and logistically complex, to get building materials out to these remote villages. The region is also still recovering from  major flooding in August of last year  – Kipnuk, one of the villages hardest hit by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, received one of the first-ever federal disaster  declarations for an Alaska tribe in the wake of that flooding .

       \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         A constellation of classified defense satellites built by the commercial company SpaceX is emitting a mysterious signal that may violate international standards, NPR has learned. Satellites associated with the Starshield satellite network appear to be transmitting to the Earth's surface on frequencies normally used for doing the exact opposite: sending commands from Earth to satellites in space. The use of those frequencies to \"downlink\" data runs counter to  standards set  by the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency that seeks to coordinate the use of radio spectrum globally. Starshield's unusual transmissions have the potential to interfere with other scientific and commercial satellites, warns  Scott Tilley , an amateur satellite tracker in Canada who first  spotted the signals . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Nearby satellites could receive radio-frequency interference and could perhaps not respond properly to commands — or ignore commands — from Earth,\" he told NPR. Outside experts agree there's the potential for radio interference. \"I think it is definitely happening,\" said Kevin Gifford, a computer science professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder who specializes in radio interference from spacecraft. But he said the issue of whether the interference is truly disruptive remains unresolved. SpaceX and the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, which operates the satellites for the government, did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Caught by the wrong antenna The discovery of the signal happened purely by chance. Tilley regularly monitors satellites from his home in British Columbia as a hobby. He was working on another project when he accidentally triggered a scan of radio frequencies that are normally quiet. \"It was just a clumsy move at the keyboard,\" he said. \"I was resetting some stuff and then all of a sudden I'm looking at the wrong antenna, the wrong band.\" The band of the radio spectrum he found himself looking at, between 2025-2110 MHz,  is reserved  for \"uplinking\" data to orbiting satellites. That means there shouldn't be any signals coming from space in that range. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Tilley's experienced eye noticed there appeared to be a signal coming down from the sky. It was in a part of the band \"that should have nothing there,\" he said. \"I got a hold of my mouse and hit the record button and let it record for a few minutes.\" Tilley then took the data and compared it to a catalog of observations made by other amateur satellite trackers. These amateurs, located around the world, use telescopes to track satellites as they move across the sky and then share their positions in a database. \"Bang, up came an unusual identification that I wasn't expecting at all,\" he said. \"Starshield.\" Starshield is a  classified version  of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, which provide internet service around the world. The U.S. has  reportedly paid  more than $1.8 billion so far for the network, though little is known about it.  According to SpaceX , Starshield conducts both Earth observation and communications missions. Since May of 2024, the National Reconnaissance Office has conducted 11 launches of Starshield satellites in what it describes as its \"proliferated system.\" \"The NRO's proliferated system will increase timeliness of access, diversify communications pathways, and enhance resilience,\" the  agency says  of the system. \"With hundreds of small satellites on orbit, data will be delivered in minutes or even seconds.\" Tilley says he's detected signals from 170 of the Starshield satellites so far. All appear in the 2025-2110 MHz range, though the precise frequencies of the signals move around. Signal's purpose in question It's unclear what the satellite constellation is up to. Starlink, SpaceX's public satellite internet network, operates at much higher frequencies to enable the transmission of broadband data. Starshield, by contrast, is using a much lower frequency range that probably only allows for the transmission of data at rates closer to 3G cellular, Tilley says. Tilley says he believes the decision to downlink in a band typically reserved for uplinking data could also be designed to hide Starshield's operations. The frequent shift in specific frequencies used could prevent outsiders from finding the signal. Gifford says another possibility is that SpaceX was just taking advantage of a quiet part of the radio spectrum. Uplink transmissions from Earth to satellites are usually rare and brief, so these frequencies probably remain dark most of the time. \"SpaceX is smart and savvy,\" he says. It's possible they decided to just \"do it and ask forgiveness later.\" He notes it's unlikely the signals from Starshield have caused significant disruptions so far, otherwise other satellite operators would have complained. Tilley told NPR he has decided to go public with his discovery because the world's satellite operators should be aware of what's happening. \"These are objects in classified orbits, which could potentially disturb other legitimate uses of space,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-93574","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"For years, men controlled one village's coffee industry — but one woman changed that","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Meridah Nandudu, a woman from the rural Ugandan village of Bugibulungu, overcame personal trauma and gender-based economic exclusion to found Bayaaya Specialty Coffee, a business that empowers over 600 women farmers by enabling them to sell coffee beans directly and earn income.

         Friday, October 17, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MBALE, eastern Uganda — Meridah Nandudu brews a medium roast coffee at the headquarters of Bayaaya Specialty Coffee, a company she founded and runs. \"Medium roast is my favorite,\" she says, taking a deep inhale of her full cup. \"It brings out the caramels, the body of the coffee, the chocolate flavors.\" But coffee is more than just a drink to her. It's a critical part of her life story and her work to improve the lives of women in her community. But she could never have imagined that coffee would play a role in charting her own course. A daughter of coffee farmers Nandudu grew up in the remote village of Bugibulungu, near the border with Kenya, on a hill lush with banana and arabica coffee trees. Her parents and grandparents were coffee farmers. But she was not interested in following in their footsteps. Part of that was due to the gender dynamics that played out in front of her: In this part of Uganda, coffee is seen as a man's thing, including producing it, selling it and consuming it. Women are reluctant to even drink coffee because there is a belief that it will affect their fertility.   But they do play an invisible and thankless role in the industry: They help grow the beans. Based on what she had seen growing up, Nandudu also didn't think there was a lot of money to be made from coffee. \"We're basically involved in the field work, like you're going to the farm with your mother — you're planting, you're harvesting. Then when the coffee is ready, our dad would come and just pick it, and then he goes and sells,\" she says. \"So we didn't know the value that came with a kilo of coffee.\" Big dreams that didn't come true Nandudu's grand dream was to leave her village, create a new life for herself and one day come back to the village to help the women there. As much as she loved her village and her childhood, Nandudu says, her memories are tainted by the violence and abuse she saw the women in her community suffer. Harvest season was the worst, Nandudu says, because couples would fight over how to spend the money earned from coffee farming, leading to a surge in domestic violence. \"As a child, witnessing violence is something that affected my mind. It's very traumatizing,\" Nandudu says, recalling the times when her aunts and other neighbors came to her family's home in the middle of the night, seeking refuge from a husband who was beating them. Every now and then, she would hear that a man from the village had killed his wife.  Nandudu's mother told her that if the women in her community had their own money, it would give them options to help them get away from a difficult situation — like an abusive spouse. \"Most of these violence cases came as a result of women being overly dependent on their husbands,\" Nandudu says. Her neighbors would also regularly come to their house asking for basic goods like salt or sugar, afraid to tell their husbands to go buy them, because it would lead to violence. \"I kept telling myself, like one day, if an opportunity comes up, I must come back here and change the life of [the women] in my community,\"   she says. With her mother's encouragement, Nandudu dreamed of going to college and becoming a lawyer. She left her village to study in Kampala, Uganda's capital. But she was not able to get into the law department. Instead she studied social work and later completed a postgraduate diploma in project management. She struggled to find a job, however, because of high unemployment rates. And that's when she began to think about coffee again. She had learned that coffee is one of Uganda's top exports and that there was indeed money to be made. So she thought about opening up a coffee business. But that took a while. Eventually, Nandudu married and had two kids. As the years went by, she felt trapped, like many of the women she knew in her village, with a controlling husband. \"He was holding me back,\" Nandudu says. \"I was a stay-at-home mother. I was not supposed to work. I could not do any business, so I had to rely fully on my husband.\" In 2020, five years into their marriage, when Nandudu was 30 years old, her husband suddenly left. One day not long after, as she was sitting at home, exhausted, with no money and no job, destitute and crying, she had an epiphany. \"I started having these thoughts in my head. Like I've been able to go to the best universities in the country, and then I have the knowledge — I also have skills,\" Nandudu says. In that moment, she thought about the women back in her village, who never got a chance to go to school and didn't have the skills she had learned: How would they be able to get out of the situation they were in? \"And then immediately I started reorganizing my brain, like restructuring myself,\" she says. \"It motivated me because I saw myself as having everything that can lift me [up from this situation].\" Returning to her coffee roots Nandudu decided to go back to her village and try to build a specialty coffee business — buying from the farmers in her village and selling the dry beans to roasters and exporters. But she quickly realized there was a lot she didn't know. \"I enter into coffee, and then I begin making mistakes, quality mistakes,\" Nandudu says — such as not drying the beans fully or storing them near livestock, which interfered with the smell of the beans. Those mistakes cost her a lot of money and wasted beans. She knew she needed guidance but couldn't afford courses that would provide training. That same year, in 2020, she heard about a  program  funded by the Netherlands that offered free business training to young entrepreneurs working in agriculture in Uganda. After just three months in the program, Nandudu says her whole life changed. She learned how to take care of coffee trees for high-quality beans, how to get the most yield from the crop and how to maintain the quality of the bean once it has been picked from the tree and goes through the whole process, until it dries. She also learned about finances, how to use a bank for business and how to save money. It helped her see that by having a successful business, she could help others too. \"I saw that coffee is literally, it's a gold that is seated on our trees,\" she says. \"It's something that can change the life of a woman. So I started, like, preaching a coffee gospel to the women [in the village] for them to understand the value that is in coffee,\" Nandudu says. She started with a small group of five women farmers from her village, teaching them what she had learned in her training, and convinced them to sell their coffee beans to her. But she encountered resistance from the men in the village. \"It was a bit tough because, as we all know, coffee is a male-dominated thing,\" she says. The husbands wouldn't allow their wives to sell the coffee at all. \"So basically, women would do what we call donkey work. They're doing the farming, the weeding, the harvesting, the pulping, the drying.\" But the money from all that work would go directly to the man of the house. \"And the moment [the men] go and sell the coffee, some of them don't come back home for two weeks — they disappear. They come back home when they have drunk off all the money. And now the woman cannot question: Where is the money? Or ask for some to pay the children's school fees. They didn't have that voice.\" So Nandudu devised a plan to get money directly into the hands of the women. She went to the male farmers' homes one by one and offered an incentive: an extra 200 Ugandan shillings (about 6 U.S. cents) per kilogram of coffee from her own profits if their wives could sell directly to her. The incentive money also went to the women, but the men recognized it would ultimately mean more money for their households, she says. Slowly, the men agreed, and many have come to accept that their wives are making their own money now. Some of the women farmers also told NPR that their financial independence allowed them to leave their abusive partner. Hundreds of women farmers Five years later, Nandudu now buys from over 600 women farmers, and several hundred male farmers too. She has won awards and grants that have helped her grow her company. Her mission and her success have become an inspiration to many other aspiring entrepreneurs in Uganda who also grew up with limited resources, according to Jackie Aldrette, executive director of AVSI-USA, the organization that provided Nandudu's training with funding from the Netherlands. \"The energy of a true protagonist spills over and lifts others as well, and today we see Meridah creating jobs and inspiring hundreds of her peers,\" Aldrette says. \"There are so many people like her that are just ready to do great things [but] haven't had an opportunity to be lifted up.\" Juliet Kwaga, 31, is one of the first farmers who sold her beans to Nandudu. \"She taught me how to use manure in my farm, so I can get higher yields,\" Kwaga says, and how to dig trenches for drainage and how to prevent soil erosion during heavy rains. Kwaga says her life looks a lot different now that she has her own money. Before, she used to have to ask her husband for money for the most basic needs, like soap or paying school fees for her children. It led to constant fights. \"But right now, I can take my child to school, buy my basic needs. I don't overly depend on my husband [who continues to farm and sell coffee].\" For Nandudu, the dream is only just beginning. She wants to expand her business and be able to roast her own coffee and export it too.  \"So we are looking at exporting our own coffee by the end of this year. And then we are also looking at creating more employment for women,\" she says.  Her motivation remains the same as it was on the day she had her epiphany: \"[To see] a woman empowered, [to see] a woman's life changing from being that woman that would literally have to beg to being a woman that can make decisions,\" Nandudu says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577129","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Ties Crime with Immigration, Blurring the Lines with Guard Deployment","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines how former President Donald Trump has used the National Guard in multiple U.S. cities—including Chicago, California, D.C., and Memphis—to support immigration enforcement operations, often under the guise of combating urban crime.

By Kat Lonsdorf, Sergio Martínez-Beltrán \n        \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         CHICAGO — It's a sunny October morning, and Yackson is waiting for a bus that will take him to meet his immigration attorney. The Venezuelan, who NPR is identifying by his first name because of his immigration status, looks at a big, run-down apartment building in front of him. Earlier this month, it was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who landed a helicopter on the roof, and arrested more than 30 people. Yackson, 39, says he's terrified. Besides this raid, he's also heard about the possibility of National Guard troops deploying here, something a federal court has put on hold for now. The father of three lives in this neighborhood and he's been scared to leave his house. \"We already don't know who is grabbing us, whether it's ICE or whether it's people who disguise themselves as ICE,\" Yackson says in Spanish. \"With the National Guard, it's going to be even harder, scarier.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In several cities across the country facing National Guard deployments, NPR has heard similar sentiment. \"The government isn't exactly doing a great job of proactively delineating this person is National Guard who isn't allowed to arrest immigrants, and this person is an ICE agent or an FBI agent who is,\" says Dara Lind a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noting that many times federal agents are in military-style gear, or masked, or not clearly marked. She says this makes it hard to look at patrols on the street and figure out who is legally authorized to engage in law enforcement activities or not. Under U.S. law, the National Guard and other military personnel can't make arrests. But experts worry that the pattern of their deployments, alongside increased federal immigration raids and operations, has allowed for violent crime and illegal immigration to be conflated into a single crisis. The Guard's actual role in immigration enforcement in these deployments remains unclear. In September, the Trump administration announced a widespread ICE operation in Illinois called Operation Midway Blitz, saying it was needed to fight crime by undocumented immigrants. It came after Trump had been pressuring Democratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker to deploy the state National Guard for the same reason, but Pritzker refused. After weeks of fighting between the two, Trump federalized the Illinois National Guard – a highly unusual move — and worked with Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott to send hundreds of his state's Guard to Illinois. Part of Trump's continued rhetoric Trump has been  conflating crime and illegal immigration  since he first emerged on the political scene. It's something that has proved popular with his base — and helped garner support for his  unprecedented crackdown on immigrants . The net has swept up people living in the country illegally along with U.S. residents, people with visas, or those granted humanitarian parole. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The White House regularly characterizes undocumented immigrants as drivers of urban lawlessness,  even though the data show that is not true . Officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House constantly refer to ICE actions as only targeting \" the worst of the worst ,\" a talking point that isn't  supported by the arrest data . \"This is really, really core to the administration's immigration policy. They toggle between 'we're only going after these really, really bad criminals,' and 'we're deporting everybody who's in the country without authorization,'\" says Lind. \"They get to play that two-step because there's this bigger body of fears that they're playing into about urban areas as unsafe, as unruly, about there being some kind of unrest, and about protests being always akin to riots.\" Trump has deployed  the National Guard in five Democratic-led cities  so far — often over the objections of state and local leaders — claiming troops are needed to control crime and lawlessness, although data show that violent crime in many of those places has decreased in recent years. Some of those deployments — like in  Chicago  and  Portland, Ore.  — have been blocked by the courts and are making their way through a federal appeals process. But others are ongoing, like in Washington, D.C., and Memphis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       These deployments have coincided with increased immigration raids which have, in effect, blurred the lines between traditional law enforcement, immigration enforcement and the role of the National Guard. In June,  Trump federalized California's National Guard  — against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes – and sent in members of the U.S. Marine Corps to quell protests in Los Angeles in response to increased immigration and deportation raids in the city. There, protesters confined to an area of downtown Los Angeles clashed with federal agents. And ICE  often launched raids  at Home Depot stores and other locations across the city. A federal judge in California  later ruled  that the National Guard troops were being used illegally there, violating the  Posse Comitatus Act , a 19th-century law that bars the use of federal troops for domestic policing, except when \"expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\" Trump appealed that ruling, and a hearing is expected later this month. Trump has also deployed troops to guard federal agents who are carrying out immigration enforcement operations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In August, Trump sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., a unique place where Trump has the legal authority to do so, along with a flood of federal law enforcement agents, including ICE, which has carried out a  sizable chunk of the arrests . The next month,  Trump announced a similar operation in Memphis  — with the support of Republican Governor Bill Lee, who approved the use of Tennessee National Guard troops. The deployment started at the end of September and is ongoing. The operation also includes officials from more than a dozen federal agencies, including ICE, and has led to more than 800 arrests, according to the Department of Justice. While the DOJ has not released a breakdown of that data, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who has been critical of the federal intervention,  noted at a press conference this week  that immigration offenses made up a significant portion of the arrests. Immigration and National Guard deployments are \"deeply intertwined\" In Illinois, Texas National Guard troops were briefly stationed at an ICE facility outside of Chicago, before their deployment was temporarily blocked. In D.C., troops have mainly been cleaning up streets and guarding federal buildings. In Memphis, they've been seen accompanying local law enforcement. But legal experts say there's a clear connection developing between Trump's use of the troops and his immigration enforcement tactics. \"We see these as deeply intertwined,\" says Benjamin Farley, special counsel at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. \"The Trump administration is using an increasingly aggressive, increasingly brutal approach to immigration enforcement, which, unsurprisingly, inspires protests. And then the protests themselves serve as a pretext or an excuse for the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard and the Armed Forces of the United States,\" he says. The Texas National Guard — which has been federalized and deployed to Illinois, even as the deployment is challenged in court — has been involved in immigration-related operations in the past. In 2021, Gov. Abbott sent hundreds of troops to the Texas-Mexico border to assist in his multibillion dollar initiative called  Operation Lone Star . Among the tasks for the troops were repelling migrants and, at least in one instance, troops used tear gas on a group of Venezuelan migrants at the border. That operation is still ongoing. Scott R. Anderson, a fellow specializing in national security law at the non-partisan Brookings Institution, notes that the way Trump seems to be using the National Guard now — largely guarding federal property — is not as dramatic as a lot of the rhetoric surrounding the deployments. Still, he says that it is pushing the envelope of the law, and could gradually change with further deployments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think precisely because it's unprecedented and because it's on uncertain legal territory, the administration is actually doing it kind of incrementally, they're not immediately jumping to the most severe thing they could be doing. And that makes just a more complicated picture, and it also complicates how you respond to it in a lot of ways,\" he says. But the legal grounds for the deployments aren't something many people caught up in them have the luxury of thinking about, says Lind of the American Immigration Council. For communities who are targeted and already frightened, taking the time to differentiate between the National Guard and a federal law enforcement agency is secondary to staying safe. \"I don't think a whole lot of people are particularly interested in parsing the relationship between the National Guard and federal law enforcement,\" she says.  NPR's Marisa Peñaloza contributed to this report from Chicago.  \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   President Trump's National Guard deployments have been blurring the lines between crime patrols and illegal immigration enforcement. Guard troops have been sent to help with immigration enforcement, including securing federal ICE facilities and in some cases protecting ICE agents during raids. The White House frequently characterizes undocumented immigrants as drivers of urban lawlessness, even though the data shows that is not true. Here to talk about all of this is NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán in Chicago and NPR's Kat Lonsdorf in D.C. Hey to both of you. KAT LONSDORF, BYLINE: Hey there. SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: Sergio, let's start with you. Just catch us up on what's been happening on the ground in Chicago the last few days. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, Ailsa, the National Guard is in Illinois. More specifically, the Texas National Guard is in Illinois, along with some federalized Illinois guard. But you won't see them out in the streets of Chicago, though. That's because a federal court temporarily blocked its deployment yesterday. Now, the only place that troops were sent in Illinois so far is an ICE processing facility outside of Chicago. I went there and not much was happening. CHANG: OK. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Now, last month, ICE launched a new operation here in Chicago, claiming it was needed to fight off crime - something state and local leaders strongly refute. Chicago has its ongoing challenges with crime - right? - but the city's homicide rate this summer was the lowest since 1965. But this is what Trump has been doing since he first emerged on the political scene - deliberately conflating these ideas of crime and illegal immigration, which has proved popular with his base and helped to garner support for his unprecedented crackdown on immigrants - those in the country illegally and, in some cases, people who are U.S. residents or have visas. CHANG: OK. Well, Kat, you've been following these various National Guard deployments or threats of deployments the past few weeks. LONSDORF: Yeah. CHANG: Can you just talk about the larger pattern you're seeing here? LONSDORF: Yeah. I mean, Trump's conflation of crime and illegal immigration has been at the center of many of these deployments. We first saw it back in June, when Trump federalized California's National Guard against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes. Trump did that to quell protests in Los Angeles in response to immigration and deportation raids in the city. The Guard was sent in to protect federal ICE facilities and personnel in that case too. And that's the same reasoning Trump has given for federalizing the Guard in Oregon as well, even though that is currently halted by the federal courts, too. Experts we've talked to say these National Guard deployments and the administration's immigration tactics are pretty intertwined right now. Here's Benjamin Farley with the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. BENJAMIN FARLEY: Using the aggressive and sort of brutal approach to immigration enforcement, generating a very expected reaction and then letting that reaction serve as a pretext for the deployment of armed forces. LONSDORF: And, you know, legally speaking, when the National Guard is federalized, which is the case in all these Democratic states where the governors have pushed back, they can't enforce state laws unless the governors say they can. CHANG: That's right. And let's be very clear here. Even if the president says that these troops are going to help fight crime in these various places, let's remember that the National Guard cannot make arrests. They cannot, like, join up with local law enforcement officers to fight crime, right? LONSDORF: Right. But they can help immigration enforcement even if they still can't make arrests because that's federal. Here's how Scott R. Anderson at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution explained it. SCOTT R ANDERSON: He's trying to get them to consent to doing a broader mission set. But until they do, he's doing this narrow one to focus on immigration law 'cause that's what he has the legal authority to do. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: And Ailsa, there's something else that's significant here. It was Texas Governor Greg Abbott who sent his National Guard troops to Illinois at Trump's request. And the Texas guard, contrary to other state guards, has been involved in immigration operations. Abbott sent troops to the Texas-Mexico border to repel migrants as part of a multibillion-dollar effort called Operation Lone Star. I mean, there's footage of troops using tear gas on a group of Venezuelan migrants at the border in 2024. So the Texas guard has done immigration-related work before, and that could impact how they'd operate if allowed to patrol on the streets here in Illinois. CHANG: But what about in places like Memphis, where the governor has approved the use of the National Guard, or in the case of D.C., where the guard is technically under the president's control? Like, how does all of that fit here? LONSDORF: Yeah, in both D.C. and Memphis, Trump has sent in various federal agencies and National Guard troops to fight crime. And federal law enforcement officials have made a lot of arrests in both those places, but a significant portion of them have been immigration-related. I talked with Maria Oceja. She's in Memphis. She's a community organizer and immigration advocate there. She says while other people in the city might have focused on Trump's message about fighting crime, immigrant communities were skeptical. MARIA OCEJA: We have been tracking the messaging that has been coming out of the White House, and so we are not fooled by this language of, oh, we're only going to Memphis to fight crime. LONSDORF: She says there's been a lot of confusion and fear in the community there. The guard's actual role in immigration enforcement in these deployments remains unclear. Again, they cannot legally make arrests. In D.C., they've mainly been cleaning up streets and guarding federal buildings. CHANG: OK. Well, Sergio, I know that you've been talking to people in Chicago all week. What have you been hearing from them? MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yeah. I mean, a lot of U.S.-born residents tell us that they are angry. They don't want the National Guard or federal immigration agents in their communities, especially because their tactics have become more aggressive, leading to the arrest of some U.S. citizens. And for undocumented immigrants, the terror is real. I talked to Jackson (ph), a Venezuelan immigrant who did not want us to use his last name because of his legal status. JACKSON: (Speaking Spanish). MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: He says that it's already been scary and challenging to live in the city where you don't know if the masked person arresting you is ICE or someone pretending to be. And with the National Guard in town, Jackson says it will be even worse. CHANG: That is NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán in Chicago and Kat Lonsdorf in D.C. Thank you to both of you. LONSDORF: Thanks, Ailsa. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577869","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"14:39:00Z","title":"OpenAI blocks MLK Jr. videos on Sora after 'disrespectful depictions'","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI has blocked users from creating AI-generated videos of Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora app after the civil rights leader’s estate raised complaints about offensive, disrespectful depictions, including fake videos of him engaging in racist and illegal behavior.

   \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 2:39 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         OpenAI has blocked users from making videos of Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora app after the estate of the civil rights leader complained about the spread of \"disrespectful depictions.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Since the company  launched Sora  three weeks ago, hyper-realistic deepfake videos of King saying crude, offensive or racist things have rocketed across social media, including fake videos of King stealing from a grocery store, speeding away from police and perpetuating racial stereotypes. Late on Thursday, OpenAI and King's estate  released  a joint statement saying AI videos portraying King are being blocked as the company \"strengthens guardrails for historical figures.\" OpenAI said it believes there are \"strong free speech interests\" in allowing users to make AI deepfakes of historical figures, but that estates should have ultimate control over how those likenesses are used. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Sora app, which remains invite-only, has taken a shoot-first, aim-later approach to safety guardrails, which has raised alarms with intellectual property lawyers, public figures and  disinformation researchers . When someone joins the app, they are instructed to record a video of themselves from multiple angles and record themselves speaking. Users can control whether others can make deepfake videos of them, which Sora calls a \"cameo.\" But the app allowed people to make videos of many celebrities and historical figures without explicit consent, enabling users to create fake footage of Princess Diana, John F. Kennedy, Kurt Cobain, Malcolm X and many others. Kristelia García, an intellectual property law professor at Georgetown Law, said for OpenAI to only act after King's estate complained is consistent with the company's \"asking forgiveness, not permission\" approach. \"The AI industry seems to move really quickly, and first-to-market appears to be the currency of the day (certainly over a contemplative, ethics-minded approach),\" García told NPR in an email. She noted how right-to-publicity and defamation laws vary by state and may not always apply to deepfakes, meaning there could be \"little legal downside to just letting things ride unless and until someone complains.\" While the ability to control how one's likeness depends on where someone's estate is based, some states have strong protections, like  California , where heirs to a public figure, or their estate, own the rights to likeness for 70 years after a celebrity's death. In the days after the Sora app was released, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman  announced changes  to the app providing rights holders the ability to opt into their likenesses being depicted by AI, rather than such portrayals being allowed by default. Still, the families of some deceased celebrities and public figures have criticized OpenAI for allowing depictions of vulgar, unflattering or incriminating behavior. After videos of Robin Williams flooded social media feeds, Zelda Williams, the late actor's daughter,  asked  the public to stop making videos of her father. \"Please, just stop sending me AI videos of my dad,\" she wrote in an Instagram post, adding that \"it's NOT what he'd want.\" Bernice King, the civil rights leader's daughter, agreed,  writing  on X: \"Please stop.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hollywood studios and talent agencies have also expressed concern that OpenAI unveiled the Sora app without receiving consent from copyright holders. It's an approach similar to how the company has developed ChatGPT, which sucked up droves of  copyrighted content  without approval or payment before eventually striking licensing deals with some publishers. The approach has sparked a wave of  copyright lawsuits . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00Z","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, presented on the Home Page of a public media platform, highlights a rotating carousel of intimate live music performances by various artists.

Yes...but there's more to the story. \n         By Barton Girdwood, Brittany Luse, Stephen Thompson, Ann Powers, Liam McBain, Neena Pathak \n        \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 3:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Is Taylor Swift exploiting her fans? NPR Music critic Ann Powers says no. NPR Music critic Stephen Thompson says yes … but with an asterisk. He says, \"All pop stars exploit their fans.\" Let's review the facts: Taylor Swift released her album  The Life of a Showgirl  on October 3. To date she has offered 38 variants of that album. If you bought all of them, it would cost you $377. That's a lowball estimate. Many of those variants were only available for 24 hours – with a countdown clock on Swift's website and all. Talk about pressure! But that limited availability also offers her fans two things: bragging rights for owning something rare and exclusive and … re-sale value. Take a Swift vinyl variant I own, the 2023  Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions  vinyl. It's currently selling for  upwards of $559 . If you look at other Swift-adjacent collectibles you start seeing even more outlandish price tags. Right now, you can buy a Papa John's pizza box with Swift's 2012  Red  album cover printed on the top for a whopping $513 on ebay. I repeat – a cardboard pizza box. Like the NFL, MLB, or NBA, \"Taylor Swift\" is an entire industry unto itself. Trading cards and all. Here's the thing about modern pop stardom: eventually your name is a product. For many pop stars, that has meant slapping their name on a beauty line and posting endlessly about it on social media. Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, and Rihanna all have makeup brands. Rihanna's Fenty Beauty made her a billionaire. In this way, Swift is different. She made her billion through music sales (physical albums, touring, concert films, etc.) alone. And that is remarkable, because as Thompson puts it, \"the music industry is extremely broken for most working musicians. You have a shrinking middle class [of artists].\" Because of streaming, it's more and more difficult to make a living wage from your music itself. Swift is far, FAR and away from nearly every other musician, but she is singular as a pop star in her insistence on being a working  musician . It makes one ask: can I knock Taylor Swift for finding a way to actually sell 3.4 million copies of her album in a single week? That is after all the life of a business woman, baby! But what is Swift actually selling in this album? That leads Thompson to another theory as to why many find Swift's business strategy so unsettling, \"There is a level of fame at which your ability to craft art that speaks to everyday people gets called into question.\" He notes how Swift has for nearly two decades made herself relatable to her fans. And on  Showgirl , Swift longs for a simple life while going to war with her haters in  armor made by Gucci . Powers adds, in Swift's latest era – her billionaire era – \"I think that it's harder for people to not feel exploited when they're buying something within this narrative than they would when they were buying something in her 'I'm opening my heart, and I'm this vulnerable woman [era].'\" Buying into the simple life of a billionaire is dizzying. And that brings us to the music itself. Is it worth the money? Powers says, \"I still think this album is more enjoyable and think it will last longer than some people do.\" But, she concludes, \"I would encourage people to draw an internal line. Think about how you are receiving this work, what your relationship is with the artists you admire, and maybe walk yourself back from making a purchase that's more habitual or status driven than actually rewarding you in any way. I think it's just a good moment to kind of confront how you practice consumerism.\" The digital version of this episode was written by Barton Girdwood and edited by Neena Pathak & Kristian Monroe. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-hamas-hostages-ceasefire-10-17-2025-9ca3413565ded65582642e96bffbcd0b","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Community Festival Celebrates Local Heritage and Unity in August 2023","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major community festival celebrating local traditions and heritage was held over three days in August 2023.

The Israeli military and security forces received the coffin from the International Committee of the Red Cross inside the Gaza Strip, and it was to be sent to the Ministry of Health’s National Center for Forensic Medicine in Israel. Israeli authorities said the family of the deceased would be notified first after a formal identification process. The handover came after Hamas’ military wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, said the remains were that of an “occupation prisoner,” suggesting that they belonged to an Israeli rather than one of the hostages of several other nationalities also taken in Gaza.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The handover of hostages remains, called for under the ceasefire agreement, has been among the key sticking points — along with aid deliveries, the opening of border crossings into Gaza and hopes for reconstruction — in a process backed by much of the international community to help end two years of devastating war in Gaza.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n A warning from Trump \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Buildings that were destroyed during the Israeli ground and air operations stand in the northern Gaza Strip during the sunrise, as seen from southern Israel, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025.

The Israeli military and Shin Bet security service, which received the remains, insisted that “Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Hamas has said some hostages’ remains were in tunnels or buildings that were destroyed by Israel, and insisted heavy machinery is required to dig through rubble to retrieve them. The group blamed Israel for the delay, saying it had not allowed any new bulldozers into Gaza. Most heavy equipment in the territory was destroyed during the war triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel, leaving only a limited amount as Palestinians try to clear massive amounts of rubble across Gaza. On Friday, two bulldozers plowed up pits in the earth as Hamas searched for hostages’ remains in Hamad City, a complex of apartment towers in the city of Khan Younis. Israeli forces repeatedly bombarded the towers during the war, toppling some, and troops conducted a weeklong raid there in March 2024, fighting militants. While much focus has been on the handover of hostages’ remains, Hamas has urged mediators to increase the flow of aid into Gaza, expedite the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and start reconstruction.  It also said work should “start immediately” to set up a committee of Palestinian independents who will run Gaza and called for Israeli troops to continue pulling back from agreed-upon areas.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The  ceasefire plan  introduced by  Trump  had called for all hostages — living and dead — to be handed over by a deadline that expired Monday. But under the deal, if that didn’t happen, Hamas was to share information about deceased hostages and try to hand them over as soon as possible. Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  has said that Israel “will not compromise” and demanded that Hamas fulfill the requirements laid out in the ceasefire deal about the return of hostages’ bodies.

In exchange, Israel freed  around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners  and detainees. In Israel, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum — which groups many families of hostages — said they will continue holding weekly rallies until all remains are returned. Israel has also returned to Gaza the bodies of 90 Palestinians for burial. Israel is expected to turn over more bodies, though officials have not said how many are in its custody or how many will be returned.  A Palestinian forensics team examining the remains said some of the bodies showed signs of mistreatment. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government in the territory. Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n France says international force for Gaza is in the pipeline  France said it’s working with Britain and the U.S. to propose a U.N. resolution in coming days that would provide a framework for an international force for Gaza. French Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pascal Confavreux said Thursday that Arab countries want a U.N. mandate for the force.  Arab countries are expected to be among those contributing troops to the force, which will oversee Egyptian-trained Palestinian police.

The attack came just as its top figures gathered to consider a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. In excerpts of an interview with CBS program 60 Minutes to be aired in full on Sunday, Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said he and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, felt “a little bit betrayed” by Israel’s attack. Kushner said he thought Trump “felt like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing, and that it was time to, it was time to be very strong and stop them from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests.” Weeks later, hosting Netanyahu at the White House, the president announced the initial contours of the planned ceasefire agreement.

United Nations data on Friday showed 339 trucks have been offloaded for distribution in Gaza since the ceasefire began a week ago. Under the agreement, some 600 humanitarian aid trucks would be allowed to enter each day. COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid in Gaza, reported 950 trucks — including commercial trucks and bilateral deliveries — crossing on Thursday and 716 on Wednesday, the U.N. said Tom Fletcher, the U.N. humanitarian aid chief, visited a World Food Program bakery in Deir al-Balah on Friday, and said in a social media post that U.N. humanitarian teams were executing a 60-day plan to massively ramp up aid. He warned that the “challenges ahead are immense,” and urged the opening of more crossings to allow more aid in Since last Saturday, WFP has sent more than 280 trucks, weighing some 3,000 metric tons, into Gaza to support bakeries, nutrition programs and general food distributions, the U.N. food aid agency said. Nahed Sheheiber, the head of Gaza’s private truckers’ union, which organizes pickups of aid after Israeli inspection, says improved security in Gaza has helped prevent looting or gangs intercepting aid convoys — even if there has been no significant increase of supplies arriving since the ceasefire. He said only 70 trucks went in Thursday. Gaza’s more than 2 million people are hoping the ceasefire will bring relief from the humanitarian disaster caused by Israel’s campaign. Throughout the war, Israel restricted aid entry to Gaza — sometimes halting it altogether. Famine was declared in Gaza City, and the U.N. says it has verified more than 400 people who died of malnutrition-related causes, including more than 100 children. Israel says it let in enough food, accusing Hamas of stealing much of it. The U.N. and other aid agencies deny the claim. ___ Associated Press writers Edith M.

Call for unity The nation had been rocked by three weeks of youth-led  anti-government protests  that started with frustration over chronic water and electricity outages but snowballed into anger with the leadership of President Andry Rajoelina. At least 22 people were killed in the protests after an initial crackdown by security forces, the United Nations said. “Today marks a turning point for our nation, for the Madagascan people themselves are thirsting for profound change in the way our country is governed,” Randrianirina said in a speech from a podium next to a red, green and white Madagascan flag. He called for peace and unity and promised to “break away from the harmful practices of the past.”  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 From barracks to palace: Soldiers who led military coups to become state leaders \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the Madagascar army colonel who was ‘in the shadows’ before launching a coup \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 UN condemns military takeover in Madagascar as coup leader to be quickly sworn in as president \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The U.N. has condemned the military takeover as an unconstitutional change of government but there has been little significant reaction from other countries, including Madagascar’s former colonial ruler, France.

The country has seen several coups and attempted coups since gaining independence in 1960, including the one that first brought Rajoelina to power as a transitional president in 2009. Despite championing the hopes of the youth, Rajoelina has been criticized for doing little to improve the lives of Madagascans, with around 75% of the population living in poverty, according to the World Bank. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ousted president is in hiding Rajoelina’s whereabouts are unknown after he left the country claiming his life was in danger following the rebellion.

Military guards of honor on either side of the room drew ceremonial swords to mark the moment, and a line of soldiers blew trumpets. The colonel, who  emerged from relative obscurity  to lead the rebellion by his CAPSAT military unit less than a week ago, was briefly imprisoned two years ago for an attempted mutiny. He said he spent most of the three months he was detained in late 2023 and early 2024 at a military hospital. Up to 2 years of military rule Randrianirina has said Madagascar will be run by a military council with him as president for between 18 months and two years before any new elections, meaning the young people who inspired the uprising may have a long wait before they are able to choose a leader. Analysts question if the youth uprising was pounced on by the military to seize power. The protests have echoed  other Gen Z-led uprisings  in Nepal, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Young Madagascans first took to the streets last month to rail against water and power outages, but have raised other issues, including the cost of living, the lack of opportunities and alleged corruption and nepotism by the elite. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Randrianirina seized on the momentum last weekend when he and his soldiers joined the anti-government protests that called for the president and government ministers to step down. There was a brief clash between his soldiers and gendarmerie security forces still loyal to Rajoelina, during which one CAPSAT soldier was killed, the colonel said. But there has been no major violence and Randrianirina’s troops have been cheered while riding through the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, in armored vehicles and their takeover celebrated by Madagascans. Randrianirina said in  an interview with The Associated Press  on Wednesday that the military takeover was a move to “take responsibility as citizens and patriots” to save “a dying country.” Coup condemned \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Rajoelina’s office has said a move earlier this week by the High Constitutional Court to invite Randrianirina to become the new president was flawed and claimed that some of the court’s judges had been threatened to sign off on an illegal coup. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Soldiers loyal to Col.

administration says most federal layoffs aren't blocked by court order \n         By Andrea Hsu, Stephen Fowler \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 17, 2025 • 7:54 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration says it has paused work on only a small share of the roughly 4,000 mass layoffs announced since Oct. 1, in order to comply with a court order. That includes more than 400 Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, 465 Education Department staff and 102 people with the Census Bureau, according to court filings released Friday. Friday's court filing came  amid a legal fight  between the administration and two federal employee unions — the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — which sued to block what they call \"politically driven RIFs,\" or reductions in force. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California granted the unions a temporary restraining order (TRO), halting some of the layoffs announced Oct. 10 and preventing new firings until she holds another hearing on Oct. 28 to consider an indefinite pause. As part of her order, Illston also directed the government to provide the court with \"an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this TRO.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In more than 30 declarations filed by the defendant agencies Friday afternoon, Trump administration officials provided some details about the layoffs and repeatedly stated they would not proceed with RIFs blocked by the court order.  At the same time, the administration made clear it believes most of the employees who have already received layoff notices – or are expected to in the near future – are not covered by the court order, which only applies to programs or offices where the union plaintiffs   have members or bargaining units. In a status conference Friday evening, Illston said she didn't think agencies should be carrying out layoffs while the temporary restraining order was in effect and urged the government to \"err on the side of caution.\" She described this moment as a terrible situation, adding \"We ought not make it worse.\" The government's attorney Elizabeth Hedges repeatedly told the judge that the government was doing everything it could to comply with her order. The plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard repeatedly said the government had taken too narrow an interpretation of the order.  In some cases, agencies indicated they believed the court order does not apply to their employees because their agency no longer has an obligation to bargain with the unions. Earlier this year, President Trump issued  an executive order  ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing national security concerns, including at agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Thomas Nagy, a human resources official with HHS, referenced the executive order in his  declaration to the court  about the 982 RIFs at HHS announced since the shutdown. \"HHS has not issued any RIF notices implicated by the Court's TRO,\" he wrote. \"Although CDC did previously have AFGE bargaining units, HHS terminated the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements on August 26, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14251.\" During the status hearing, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard noted that the cancellation of collective bargaining rights at many agencies is under legal dispute. She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order. Illston agreed to that change.  The plaintiffs also asked the court to add three more unions to the lawsuit and to the temporary restraining order, to broaden the number of employees who would be covered by the pause on RIFs.  Illston agreed to add the three unions to the temporary restraining order and said she would consider adding them as plaintiffs in the case at the next hearing. At the hearing on Wednesday, Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the most recent RIFs as \"ready, fire, aim\" and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding \"to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston \"another far left, partisan judge.\" Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs \"an unfortunate consequence\" of the government shutdown. OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect. While the White House promised \"substantial\" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January. Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary. That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates. Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-national-guard-trump-913ecce44b6bcc5d0cba1b252dfd34ce","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00+00:00","title":"Trump Administration Appeals to Supreme Court Over National Guard Deployment in Chicago and Memphis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration sought Supreme Court intervention to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago and Memphis for immigration enforcement, following a federal judge’s ruling that found no evidence of rebellion in Illinois.

The emergency appeal to the high court came after a judge prevented, for at least two weeks, the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas to assist immigration enforcement. A federal appeals court refused to put the judge’s order on hold. The conservative-dominated court has handed Trump repeated victories in emergency appeals since he took office in January, after lower courts have ruled against him and often over the objection of the three liberal justices. The court has allowed Trump to  ban transgender people from the military , claw back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, move aggressively against immigrants and fire the Senate-confirmed leaders of  independent federal agencies , \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In the dispute over the Guard, U.S. District Judge April Perry said she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump’s immigration crackdown. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Israel identifies the remains of one more hostage \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 In AP interview, Harris says Democrats ‘are standing up for working people’ in government shutdown \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 After Voting Rights Act case arguments, concerns over diminished minority representation rise \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n But Solicitor General D.

They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, with Trump’s support, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” but only with the blessing of state lawmakers.  The deployment “sets a dangerous precedent for military intrusion into local communities,” Memphis City Council member JB Smiley said. Since their  arrival on Oct. 10 , troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power. “We’re in a unique spot in this city to have the resources available to us to remove the crime element in Memphis,” Lee said recently. For years, Memphis has dealt with  high violent crime , including assaults, carjackings and homicides. While this year’s statistics show improvement, many people acknowledge that violence remains a problem. In California,  a judge in September said  deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal . By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained and the judge did not order them to leave. ___ Associated Press writers Christine Fernando in Chicago, Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee, and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-george-santos-commutation-pardon-8ae46d6351cefe01d79f74920521b7a2","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"22:13:04+00:00","title":"Trump Commutes Sentence of Former Rep.

Trump said Friday he had commuted the sentence of former U.S. Rep.  George Santos , who  was slated to serve  more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges. Joseph Murray, one of Santos’ lawyers, told The Associated Press late Friday that the former lawmaker was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, around 11 p.m., and was greeted outside the facility by his family. The New York Republican was sentenced in April after admitting last year to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of 11 people — including his own family members — to make donations to his campaign.  He  reported to  FCI Fairton on July 25 and was housed in a minimum security prison camp with fewer than 50 other inmates. “George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” Trump posted on his social media platform. He said he had “just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Good luck George, have a great life!” Trump said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Vance warns of deeper cuts ahead for federal workers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Federal government shutdown grinds into a week two as tempers flare at the Capitol \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Government shutdown drags on as health care compromise remains elusive \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Santos’ account on X, which has been active throughout his roughly 84 days in prison, reposted a screenshot of Trump’s Truth Social post Friday. During his time behind bars, Santos has been writing regular dispatches in a local newspaper on Long Island, in which he mainly complained about the prison conditions.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n In his latest letter, though, he pleaded to Trump directly, citing his fealty to the president’s agenda and to the Republican Party. “Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he  wrote in The South Shore Press  on Oct. 13. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Santos’ commutation is Trump’s latest high-profile  act of clemency  for former Republican politicians since retaking the White House in January.  In late May, he pardoned former U.S. Rep.  Michael Grimm , a New York Republican who in 2014 pleaded guilty to underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant he ran in Manhattan. He also pardoned former Connecticut Gov.  John Rowland , whose promising political career was upended by a corruption scandal and two federal prison stints. But in granting clemency to Santos, Trump was rewarding a figure who has drawn scorn from within his own party. After becoming the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress in 2022, Santos served less than a year after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story. On the campaign trail, Santos had claimed he was a successful business consultant with Wall Street cred and a sizable real estate portfolio. But when his resume came under scrutiny, Santos eventually admitted he had never graduated from Baruch College — or been a standout player on the Manhattan college’s volleyball team, as he had claimed. He had never worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He wasn’t  even Jewish . Santos insisted he meant he was “Jew-ish” because his mother’s family had a Jewish background, even though he was raised Catholic.  In truth, the then-34-year-old was struggling financially and even faced eviction. Santos was charged in 2023 with  stealing from donors and his campaign , fraudulently collecting unemployment benefits and lying to Congress about his wealth.  Within months, he was  expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives  -- with 105 Republicans joining with Democrats to make Santos just the  sixth member  in the chamber’s history to be ousted by colleagues.. Santos  pleaded guilty  as he was set to stand trial. Still, a prominent former House colleague, U.S. Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene , urged the White House to commute Santos’ sentence, saying in a letter sent just days into his prison bid that the punishment was “a grave injustice” and a product of judicial overreach. Greene was among those who cheered the announcement Friday. But U.S. Rep. Nick LaLota, a Republican who represents part of Long Island and has been highly critical of Santos, said in a post on social media that Santos “didn’t merely lie” and his crimes “warrant more than a three-month sentence.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “He should devote the rest of his life to demonstrating remorse and making restitution to those he wronged,” LaLota said. Santos’ clemency appears to clear not just his prison term, but also any “further fines, restitution, probation, supervised release, or other conditions,” according to a copy of Trump’s order  posted on X  by Ed Martin, the Justice Department’s pardon attorney.  As part of his guilty plea, Santos had agreed to pay restitution of $373,750 and forfeiture of $205,003. In explaining his reason for granting Santos clemency, Trump said the lies Santos told about himself were no worse than misleading statements U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal -- a Democrat and frequent critic of the administration -- had  made about his military record. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Blumenthal apologized 15 years ago for implying that he served in Vietnam, when he was stateside in the Marine Reserve during the war. “This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!” Trump wrote. The president himself was  convicted in a New York court  last year in a case involving hush money payments. He derided the case as part of a politically motivated witch hunt. __ Associated Press writers Michael R.

(AP) — A South Carolina inmate who killed a man, burned his eyes with cigarettes and then painted “catch me if u can” on the wall with the victim’s blood more than 20 years ago has been scheduled to be executed next month. The state Supreme Court issued the death warrant Friday for Stephen Bryant, 44. The court denied a request from Bryant’s lawyers, who asked for a delay because they work with the federal court system and  the U.S. government is shut down . While Bryant is being put to death Nov. 14 for one killing,  prosecutors said  he also shot and killed two other men he was giving rides to as they were reliving themselves on the side of the road during a few weeks that terrorized Sumter County in October 2004. Bryant will be the 50th person executed  in South Carolina  since the state restarted the death penalty in 1985 and the seventh inmate put to death in less than 14 months since the state was able to obtain a drug for lethal injection and reopen the death chamber after an  unintentional 13-year pause . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Bryant will have until Oct. 31 to choose if he wants to die by  lethal injection ,  firing squad  or in the electric chair.

At least five other executions are set in the U.S. during the rest of 2025. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Taunts written in blood on the wall Bryant admitted to killing Willard “TJ” Tietjen after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble. Tietjen was shot several times. Candles were lit around his body. Someone took a potholder made by his daughter when she was child, dipped the corner in blood and wrote “victem 4 in 2 weeks. catch me if u can” on the wall, authorities said. Tietjen’s daughter called him several times, getting more worried when he didn’t answer. On the sixth call, she testified a strange voice answered. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The person on the other end told her she had the right number. Then she demanded to speak to her father. “And he said ‘you can’t, I killed him.’ And I said, ‘this isn’t funny, who are you?’ He said, ‘I’m the prowler. And I said, ‘excuse me, who are you?’ He said, ‘I’m the prowler,” Kimberly Dees testified before a judge who determined Bryant’s sentence. More killings terrorize a South Carolina county Prosecutors said Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of lonely, rural roads he shot them in the back. As deputies frantically looked for the killer, many of the 100,000 people in Sumter County lived in fear over the random attacks. Officers stopped nearly everyone driving on dirt roads and told people to be leery of anyone they did not know asking for help. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Bryant used drugs to blunt pain from alleged sex abuse Bryant’s lawyers said he was troubled in the months before the killing, begging a probation agent and his aunt to get him help because he couldn’t stop thinking about being sexually abused by four male relatives when he was a child. “He was very upset. He looked like he was being tortured. It’s like his soul was just laid wide open. In his eyes you could see he was hurting and suffering and he was living the abuse over again as it was coming out,” aunt Terry Caulder testified. Bryant tried to help himself through the pain by using meth and smoking joints he sprayed with bug killer, his defense attorneys said. Previous inmates executed have said methods are cruel The six inmates executed in South Carolina since September 2024 have argued the  state’s methods  are cruel and unusual punishments, but have not been able to stop their deaths. With the firing squad, attorneys for the inmates say the three volunteers with rifles nearly missed the heart of the second man killed,  Mikal Mahdi.  They suggested Mahdi was in  agonizing pain  for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly. Condemned inmates have also scrutinized the lethal injection procedures, which appear to now use  two doses of the powerful sedative pentobarbital . They said inmates drown in a rush of fluid into their lungs but are paralyzed and cannot react. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Witnesses to the four executions have not seen any signs of struggle and report the prisoners appear to have lost consciousness in about a minute."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-trump-banks-1dfafbd747aecc1e9ed6e0e02631a760","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"04:53:51+00:00","title":"Wall Street Recovers After Volatile Week Amid Bank Loan Worries and Trade Tensions","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street ended a volatile week on Friday with gains across major indices, driven by improved bank earnings and a shift in U.S.-China trade rhetoric.

2025-10-17T04:53:51+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street cruised to the finish of a winning week on Friday after banks recovered some of their  sharp losses from the day before . The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 238 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.  The gains capped the best week for the S&P 500 since early August, but it was a roller-coaster ride. Indexes careened through several  jarring swings  as worries built about the financial health of small and midsized banks, as well as the souring trade relationship between the United States and China. Some of the nervousness around U.S.-China trade tensions eased on Friday after President Donald Trump said that  very high tariffs he threatened to put on Chinese imports  are not sustainable. Trump also told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that he would meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, at an upcoming conference in South Korea. That’s counter to an earlier, angry posting he made on social media, where he said there seemed to be “no reason” for such a meeting. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Bank stocks, meanwhile, stabilized on Friday after several reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, including Truist Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp and Huntington Bancshares.

It had come into the day with a loss of roughly 30% since mid-September.  The question is whether the lenders’ problems are just a collection of one-offs or a signal of something larger threatening the industry. Uncertainty is high following a long stretch where many borrowers were able to stay in business, even with the weight of higher interest rates. And with prices soaring to records for all kinds of investments, the appetite for risk may have gotten too high.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon addressed the issue on an earnings conference call with analysts earlier this week. “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Dimon said. “Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” “But banks make loan loss provisions and typically have plenty of capital to keep the cockroaches from causing structural damage,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Based on earnings and data so far, it looks like this isn’t an infestation” and that the potential canary in the coal mine “is probably passed out and not dead.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.94 points to 6,664.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 238.37 to 46,190.61, and the Nasdaq composite gained 117.44 to 22,679.97. In the bond market, Treasury yields steadied following their sharp slides from Thursday, which came as investors rushed into investments seen as safer.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.00% from 3.99% late Thursday. Gold also pulled back from its latest record as more calm seeped through the market.  The price for an ounce fell 2.1% to $4,213.30, but it’s still up roughly 60% for the year so far. Besides worries about tariffs,  gold’s price has also surged   on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and concerns about the massive amounts of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are building.  In stock markets abroad, indexes dropped across much of Europe and Asia after Wall Street’s weakness from Thursday moved westward. Germany’s DAX lost 1.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng sank 2.5% for two of the world’s bigger moves. ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/alaska-typhoon-flooding-7e6e6b72c5587c3a00b82982ffab56bd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:04:00+00:00","title":"Alaska Flooding Displaces Over 2,000; Homes Destroyed, Recovery Expected to Last 18 Months","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After remnants of Typhoon Halong struck remote western Alaska villages, including Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, severe flooding destroyed or damaged over 90% of homes in some areas.

A major disaster declaration by President Donald Trump could provide federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including money for emergency and permanent work. The three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to Trump, urging swift approval. The storm surge pummeled a sparsely populated region off the state’s main road system where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year. The villages typically have just a few hundred residents, who hunt and fish for much of their food, and relocating to the state’s major cities will bring a vastly different lifestyle. Alexie Stone, of Kipnuk, arrived in Anchorage in a military jet with his brothers, children and mom, after  his home was struck  by the flooding.

Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, of Toksook Bay, on an island northwest of Kipnuk, described for the assembly how she rode out the storm’s 100 mph (161 kmh) winds with her daughter and niece. “We had no choice but to sit in our home and wait to see if our house is going to come off the foundation or if debris is going to bust open our windows,” she said.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n It didn’t, but others weren’t as fortunate.

Andrew, younger brother of  King Charles III , said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace that “the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family.”  “With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,” Andrew said in his statement Friday. “As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Epstein-related allegations It’s the latest fall from grace for the 65-year-old prince, who had already stepped down from public life in 2019 over his links to Epstein despite his denials of any wrongdoing.

His attempt to refute Giuffre’s allegations  backfired  during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals — such as disputing Giuffre’s recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring — and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them. Within days of the interview, Andrew  stepped down from his royal duties . Giuffre sued him and the case was  settled  in 2022 for an undisclosed sum. A statement filed in court said that the prince acknowledged Epstein was a sex trafficker and Giuffre was “an established victim of abuse.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Family repercussions As well as no longer using the title of the Duke of York, a long-established title that was gifted to him by his mother Queen Elizabeth II at his wedding to Sarah Ferguson in 1986, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth. Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson will also no longer use the title of Duchess of York. Their children, Beatrice and Eugenie, will remain princesses.

After emails emerged this week showing that  Prince Andrew  remained in contact with the convicted sex offender  Jeffrey Epstein  longer than he previously admitted, the House of Windsor finally moved to insulate the monarchy from years of  tawdry headlines  about Andrew’s dodgy friends and suspicious business deals.  Buckingham Palace on Friday released a statement from Andrew saying that he had agreed to give up use of his last remaining royal titles so that continued allegations about him “don’t distract from the work of His Majesty.” This week’s revelations demonstrated that Andrew had committed the unforgivable sin of misleading the British public, said Craig Prescott, an expert on the monarchy and constitutional law at Royal Holloway University of London. “To say something which is proven not to be true, I think, is the straw that broke the camel’s back,’’ he said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A look at Prince Andrew’s antics and scandals that have tried royal patience for decades \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Prince Andrew gives up his Duke of York title as Epstein allegations refuse to fade \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Democrats say Trump needs to be involved in shutdown talks.

William recently gave an interview in which he set out his vision for the monarchy, saying that the institution needed to change to make sure that it is a force for good. “In some ways, Prince Andrew has been the exact opposite of that,” Prescott said. “And there is no space for that in the modern monarchy.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Andrew, 65, is the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.

Following Friday’s announcement, Andrew will no longer use his remaining royal titles, including the Duke of York, though he technically retains them. Formally stripping him of those titles would be a time-consuming process requiring an act of Parliament. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A long time coming Andrew’s banishment completes a process that began in November 2019, when he  gave up all of his public duties  and charity roles. That was triggered by a disastrous interview Andrew gave to the BBC as he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a  17-year-old girl, Virginia Giuffre,  who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. The prince was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier. The interview also sowed the seeds of this week’s upheaval, when Andrew told the BBC that he had cut off contact with Epstein in December 2010. British newspapers on Sunday revealed that Andrew wrote an email to Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew wrote the note after renewed reporting on the Epstein scandal, telling him they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it.” Andrew has recently faced another round of grimy stories as newspapers release excerpts of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which will be published on Tuesday. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement  with Giuffre  after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Front-page fodder for wrong reasons The prince has been the subject of tabloid stories stretching back to at least 2007, when he sold his house near Windsor Castle for 20% over the 15 million pound asking price. The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then-president of Kazakhstan, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain. Last year, a court case revealed Andrew’s relationship with a businessman and  suspected Chinese spy  who was barred from the United Kingdom as a threat to national security. Authorities were concerned that the  man could have misused his influence  over Andrew, according to court documents. While the palace said Andrew had decided to give up his royal titles, royal commentator Jennie Bond said the king and Prince William exerted “enormous pressure” on him. “We could say he has fallen on his sword, but I think he’s been pushed onto it,” Bond told the BBC. “I don’t think this is a decision that Andrew, quite an arrogant man — very, very fond of his status — would have willingly made without a lot of pressure.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Insulating the monarchy at a delicate time While the cumulative weight of Andrew’s scandals demanded a response from the royal family, this week’s revelations came at a particularly sensitive moment for the king as he prepares for  a state visit to the Vatican,  where he is expected to pray beside Pope Leo XIV. The visit is very important to Charles, who has made the bridging of faiths an important part of his “mantra,” said George Gross, an expert on theology and the monarchy at King’s College, London. “I think this was the speediest, really the quickest way of lowering his status even more without having to go to Parliament,” Gross said. “Even if Parliament would have approved, it takes time.’’ \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Charles may also have been motivated by a desire to protect the work of Queen Camilla, who has made combating domestic violence one of her signature issues, and the Duchess of Edinburgh, who has sought to combat sexual violence in war zones such as Congo. The king will hope that this move finally draws a line between Andrew and the rest of the royal family, Prescott said. “If there are allegations, or further stuff comes out, it will all be on Prince Andrew,” he said. “They’ve severed the connection between Prince Andrew and the monarchy as an institution.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/no-kings-protests-trump-immigration-first-amendment-f04e7a4728c10b694f540bcef0646370","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:02:10+00:00","title":"Mass 'No Kings' Protests Expected Across U.S. Amid Growing Tensions Over Authoritarian Policies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Saturday, October 17, 2025, thousands of people across the United States are expected to participate in the second 'No Kings' protest, a nationwide demonstration opposing what organizers describe as President Donald Trump’s increasingly authoritarian policies.

in thousands of places around the U.S. in opposition to what some are characterizing as increasingly authoritarian practices by President Donald Trump. It’s the  second “No Kings” protest  and third mass movement against the administration this year, and it comes amid an  intensifying conflict  between federal law enforcement and protesters nationwide.

Confrontations were isolated and the protests were largely peaceful.  Police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal  immigration enforcement raids  erupted the week prior and sparked demonstrations across the country,  used tear gas  and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. Officers in Portland also fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse a crowd that protested in front of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building well into the evening. One protester was  killed during the Salt Lake City march  in June. A safety volunteer shot at a person allegedly pointing a rifle at demonstrators, but inadvertently struck and killed protester  Arthur Folasa Ah Loo , a beloved fashion designer. Utah organizers focus on healing  Four months later, no one has been charged. Experts have said state gun laws may shield both the shooter and the man who brandished a rifle but didn’t fire shots. Jamie Carter, an organizer of Saturday’s rally, said Utah activists considered not participating in this round of “No Kings” demonstrations, but “we also felt that we really had to get back out there.”  Organizers are not affiliated with the groups who put on the June demonstration that turned deadly. Safety volunteers will be present but unarmed, and all have received de-escalation training, said Carter, of Salt Lake Indivisible. Attendees have been asked not to bring weapons. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We really want this to be a very uplifting, happy event of people coming together in a community to kind of try to erase and replace some of the bad memories,” she said. Concerns about large political demonstrations remain heightened in Utah, where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was also  assassinated during a speaking event  last month. Crackdown on protests Trump’s crackdown against protests, especially in Democratic cities, has intensified since the June marches. He has since sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tenn. His efforts to deploy troops to Chicago and  Portland, Oregon , have stalled in federal court.  Organizers in Chicago are expecting tens of thousands of demonstrators at a popular Lake Michigan park, followed by a downtown march. Federal immigration agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Chicago, the nation’s third largest city, with  increasingly aggressive tactics  since September. Protests have been frequent and well attended in recent weeks, and have boiled over in  intense clashes  outside a suburban federal immigration  processing center . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “People are angrier. It feels so much more immediate,” said Denise Poloyac with Indivisible Chicago. “They’re very concerned about what’s happening in Chicago and around the country.” The “No Kings” organizers have led numerous virtual safety trainings leading up to the protests with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is listed as an official partner on the “No Kings” website. The trainings informed viewers about their rights during protests — such as whether you are required to carry ID or if wearing a mask is allowed (both vary according to each state) — and emphasized de-escalation techniques for encounters with law enforcement.  Each official protest has a safety plan, which includes designated medics and emergency meeting spots. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Mixed response from elected officials The protests have already drawn swift condemnation from some of the country’s top politicians, with House Speaker Mike Johnson dubbing the event the “Hate America rally” at a news conference on Wednesday.  Some state leaders, like Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, have decided to activate the National Guard ahead of the protests.  “Texas will deter criminal mischief and work with local law enforcement to arrest anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property,” Abbott said in a statement. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom struck a more optimistic tone, saying he hopes Californians turn out in large numbers and remain peaceful. He said Trump “hopes there is disruption, there’s some violence” that he can exploit. ___ Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City; Christopher Weber in Los Angeles; Juan A.

Trump’s frustration with the conflict has surfaced repeatedly in the nine months since he returned to office, but with his latest comments he edged back in the direction of pressing Ukraine to give up on retaking land it has lost to Russia. “Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts,” Trump said in a Truth Social post not long after hosting Zelenskyy and his team for more than two hours of talks. “They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!” Later, soon after arriving in Florida, where he’s spending the weekend, Trump urged both sides to “stop the war immediately” and implied that Moscow keep territory it’s taken from Kyiv. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “You go by the battle line wherever it is — otherwise it’s too complicated,” Trump told reporters. “You stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Orbán celebrates Hungary as ‘the only place in Europe’ where a Trump-Putin meeting can be held \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Russian barrage causes blackouts in Ukraine as Zelenskyy seeks Trump’s help \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump says he’ll meet with Putin in Hungary.

In recent weeks, he had shown growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and  expressed greater openness  to helping Ukraine win the war. After meeting with Zelenskyy in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly last month, Trump even said he believed the Ukrainians could  win back all the the territory  they had lost to Russia since Putin launched the February 2022 invasion. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who had previously insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Zelenskyy after Friday’s meeting said it was time for a ceasefire and negotiations.

The president also signaled to  Zelenskyy  on Friday that he’s leaning against selling him long-range Tomahawk missiles, weaponry that the Ukrainians believe could be a game changer in helping prod Putin to the negotiating table. Zelenskyy at the start of the White House talks said he had a “proposition” in which Ukraine could provide the United States with its advanced drones, while Washington would sell Kyiv the  Tomahawk cruise missiles . But Trump said he was hesitant to tap into the U.S. supply, a turnabout after days of suggesting he was seriously weighing sending the missiles to help Ukraine beat back Russia’s invasion. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I have an obligation also to make sure that we’re completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what’s going to happen in war and peace,” Trump said. “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks.

Zelenskyy also said “we need Tomahawks” because “it’s very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.” Trump’s latest rhetoric on Tomahawks was certainly disappointing to the Ukrainians. In recent days,  Trump had shown an openness  to selling Ukraine the Tomahawks, even as Putin warned that such a move would further strain the U.S.-Russian relationship.  Why Tomahawks? But following  Thursday’s call with Putin , Trump began downplaying the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.) Zelenskyy had been  seeking the Tomahawks,  which would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deep into Russian territory and target key military sites, energy facilities and critical infrastructure. Zelenskyy has argued that the potential for such strikes would help compel Putin to take Trump’s calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with the Tomahawks “won’t change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries,” according to Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     President Donald Trump greets Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, Aug. 15, 2025.

But Zelenskyy told reporters that the animus toward Putin “is not about feelings.” “They attacked us, so they are an enemy for us. They don’t intend to stop,” Zelenskyy added. “So they are an enemy. It is not about someone just hating someone else. Although, undoubtedly, we hate the enemy.

Trump emerged from those meetings certain he was on track to arranging direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin. But the Russian leader hasn’t shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine. Asked Friday if he was concerned that Putin was stringing him along, Trump acknowledged it was a possibility but said he was confident he could handle the Russian leader. “I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,” Trump said. He added, “I think I’m pretty good at this stuff.” ___ Megerian reported from West Palm Beach, Fla.

The initiative, now known as the National Education Opportunity Network (NEON), brings college-level courses from 17 elite universities—including Harvard—directly into Title I high schools. Over five years, NEON has delivered over 40,000 courses to students across 33 states, with 80% of students passing. NEON students are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges and persist in college compared to peers, addressing the systemic inequity where elite universities remain underrepresented by low-income students. Despite limited funding—only $7.5 million in 2024 and 32 full-time staff—NEON has gained support from major foundations and individuals like Henry McCance.

That’s what Leslie Cornfeld decided after a decade advising New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s two education secretaries — and seeing how few low-income students went to the universities that lead to high-paying jobs. Cornfeld said she spent part of her time in the Obama administration visiting the nation’s Title I high schools, those with a high percentage of low-income students. She recalled: “We heard the same themes over and over again from principals, district leaders and students. That even the most talented, hard-working scholars — in rural communities, poor urban communities, Native American communities — cannot get on the radar of more selective universities.” And even if they could get on their radar, students did not believe that they were college-ready or college-worthy, Cornfeld said. Meanwhile, when she and her Washington colleagues met with higher education leaders, they repeatedly claimed, “We wish that we could find talented lower income scholars but we just can’t find them.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n For Cornfeld, this made no sense, since universities seemed to have had no trouble finding the very best athletes, often from low-income backgrounds, to play on their teams.

Cornfeld decided to connect the dots and bring elite universities into non-elite schools. By fall 2019, with a staff of three, the Lab was delivering Harvard College poetry class to two dozen high schools. The Lab simultaneously developed a range of supports: connecting professors with students by Zoom; training high school teachers as course co-teachers; and hiring college undergraduates as course teaching fellows and mentors in applying to and navigating college. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Over the past five years, the Equity Lab, now called the National Education Opportunity Network, or NEON,  reports  it has brought 60 college credit-bearing courses from 17 universities to more than 40,000 high school students in 33 states — with 80 percent of students passing the courses. NEON is currently in every Title I school in Jackson, Mississippi, 120 Title I schools in New York City and has plans to matriculate 1 million Title I high schools into online college courses within a decade.  Should NEON’s goal be achieved, it would surpass the number of low-income students  annually taking Advanced Placement tests . Sixty percent of A.P. exams taken by low-income students in 2023 scored too low for college credit, a statistic that has not budged in 20 years, according to  reporting from the New York Times . “We are a very different animal than A.P.,” Cornfeld said. “We are serving low-income, underresourced scholars and this model was developed for them. We are bringing colleges into the schools and changing the culture.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A lean nonprofit Although the National Education Opportunity Network has large ambitions, it remains small in two significant ways. The nonprofit has only 32 full-time staff, and its annual revenue in 2024 was just $7.5 million. Carnegie has provided NEON two more grants — $200,000 in 2021 and $3 million this year. And over the past six years, NEON has  attracted funds  from the Bill & Melinda Gates, NBA, Apollo and Morgan Stanley foundations, among others. The Lab also has attracted support from individuals. The biggest benefactor among them is venture capitalist Henry McCance. “My VC background very much focuses on backing the best people,” McCance said, noting Cornfeld’s background as a federal civil rights prosecutor. McCance was also impressed by the NEON’s model, which connects existing, paid-for college courses with existing, paid-for government employees at high schools. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “That gave them the ability to really start influencing thousands of students with relatively limited resources,” McCance said. While some large-scale private interventions — like Mark Zuckerberg’s  $100 million investment in Newark public schools  and the Gates Foundation’s  $1 billion Small Schools Initiative  — have stumbled, McCance noted that NEON has fared better by starting small and proving its model. “Then they could go to other universities, other school districts and show them the success they had in the last year and build on it,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n 512 high schools and counting NEON’s model is not without hurdles. Celeste Pico, principal of Lompoc High School in California decided to introduce two NEON courses to increase college-prep offerings after the pandemic. “We’d be lying to you if we told you this has not taken a lot of time,” Pico said. “But we knew it was in the best interest of our students, because it’s more than having access to those classes — it’s helped close the gap for a lot of our students financially.” Increasingly, NEON learners are entering college having finished one year of university-level courses, Pico said. In 2024-’25, Lompoc offered six NEON courses, eliminating several A.P. classes, in part because the A.P. grade is based on only one test. Adrienne Battle, superintendent of the Metro Nashville Public Schools in Tennessee, has also scaled up NEON courses in her district. “We’ve received quite a high positive-response rate and requests from not only our school teams but also from our students and parents,” she said, adding that she plans to expand NEON offerings in “all 12 of my zoned high schools.” Closing the confidence gap Marah Rigaud is a first-generation Haitian American who took five NEON courses at her high school in Long Island, N.Y., and now attends Yale. “Hearing these big names like Yale, Harvard, Georgetown can appear intimidating at first,” she said. “And when you don’t have that experience, you kind of feel a bit behind and thinking that college is some kind of impossible feat. These courses give you a foundation.” Rigaud is one of the more than 10,000 students whose post-secondary outcomes NEON is tracking through a study by Robert Balfanz of Johns Hopkins. After five years of  data analysis , Balfanz found that NEON students who pass a course are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges than students from similar high schools — and also persist in college at higher rates. Can the National Education Opportunity Network reach its goal of serving 1 million students within 10 years? Cornfeld thinks so because demand for NEON courses is “higher than ever,” she said, with more than 35 new districts reaching out to join the network. McCance, the Lab’s biggest individual funder, said, “I’ve never actually thought of whether the goal is precisely achievable or not,” but “one hurdle, quite frankly, is capital.” ______ Tamara Straus  is senior editor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the  full article .

Tampa-area prosecutors on Wednesday filed a court notice that they were dropping charges against the 24-year-old man from Ruskin, Florida, who had faced a count of felony aggravated animal cruelty. The “nolle prosequi” notice usually is filed when there’s a lack of evidence or witnesses. The bull terrier, nicknamed Trooper by the Florida Highway Patrol, was alive when he was found by a trooper in floodwaters up to his chest along Interstate 75 in the Tampa area as residents evacuated Florida’s Gulf Coast hours before the Category 3 hurricane made landfall. Troopers brought him to a vet, where he was examined for injuries and received a clean bill of health.

It comes against the backdrop of a  government shutdown  that not only has closed federal  programs and services,  but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts  Congress and the courts  in ways that organizers warn are a slide toward American authoritarianism. Trump himself is away from Washington at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. “They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” Trump said in a Fox News interview airing early Friday, before he departed for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. super PAC fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. Protests are expected nearby Saturday. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While the earlier protests this year —  against Elon Musk’s cuts in spring,  then to counter  Trump’s military parade  in June — drew crowds, organizers say this one is building a more unified opposition movement.

Bernie Sanders  are joining in what organizers view as an antidote to Trump’s actions, from the administration’s clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Democrats say Trump needs to be involved in shutdown talks.

What questions do you have for them? \n    \n \n As Republicans and the White House dismiss the protests as a rally of radicals, Levin said their own sign-up numbers are growing.

From the White House to Capitol Hill,  GOP leaders  disparaged the rallygoers as “communists” and “Marxists.”  They say Democratic leaders, including Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces. “I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said  House Speaker Mike Johnson,  R-La.  “Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism” and “Marxists in full display.”  Democrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n But for many Democrats, the government closure is also a way to stand up to Trump, and try to push the presidency back to its place in the U.S. system as a co-equal branch of government. In a Facebook post, Sanders of Vermont, himself a former presidential contender, said, “It’s a love America rally.” “It’s a rally of millions of people all over this country who believe in our Constitution, who believe in American freedom and,” he said, pointing at the GOP leadership, “are not going to let you and Donald Trump turn this country into an authoritarian society.” The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent, unsure about how best to respond to Trump’s return to the White House. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In April, the national march against Trump and Elon Musk had 1,300 registered locations. In June, for the first “No Kings” day, there were 2,100 registered locations. The march Saturday will have more than 2,600 registered locations, Levin said. “What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine,” Levin said. “The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender.”  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he wasn’t sure if he would join the rallygoers Saturday, but he took issue with the Republicans’ characterization of the events.  “What’s hateful is what happened on January 6th,” he said, referring to the 2021 Capitol attack, as Trump’s supporters stormed the building to protest Joe Biden’s election victory. “What you’ll see this weekend is what patriotism looks like, people showing up to express opposition to the extremism that Donald Trump has been unleashing on the American people.” ___ Riddle reported from Montgomery, Alabama.

Federline’s includes some salacious stories and some potentially disturbing details about her behavior that have already made headlines. “I want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there,” Federline, 47, told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview, backed by palm trees in Hawaii, where he now lives with wife Victoria Prince and their two daughters. “That’s a very, very big part of this for me.

She said Federline has engaged in “constant gaslighting.”  “Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I’m the only one who genuinely gets hurt here.” She said, adding that “if you really know me, you won’t pay attention to the tabloids of my mental health and drinking.” She also addressed her relationship with her sons:  “I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys. Relationships with teenage boys is complex. I have felt demoralized by this situation and have always asked and almost begged for them to be a part of my life.

He says in the book that he wrote it in part as a public plea for her to get more help. “I’ve lost hope that things will ever fully turn around,” he writes, “but I still hope that Britney can find peace.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/brewers-dodgers-murphy-nlcs-d3b8709f46b8095ec4c92727126c498a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:44:53+00:00","title":"Shohei Ohtani Dominates, Sweeps Brewers in NLCS as Dodgers Advance to World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Milwaukee Brewers, who had a strong regular season with a 97-65 record and a dominant head-to-head record against the Los Angeles Dodgers, were swept in the National League Championship Series.

Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy suggested. But not only in payroll and star power.  On the baseball field, too. Where it really matters. After compiling the majors’ best record during the regular season, the scrappy Brewers appeared capable of beating anybody — until  they ran into Shohei Ohtani  and the Los Angeles Dodgers in October. Milwaukee mustered only four runs and 14 hits in a four-game Dodgers sweep that left the Brewers steps short of the World Series once again. The team’s only pennant came in 1982, when Milwaukee was in the American League.  “The pitching performances by the Dodgers basically put the hammer down,” Murphy said. Before the series, Murphy did his best to paint a picture of David vs. Goliath, calling the Dodgers “a powerhouse” and joking he was “sure that most Dodger players can’t name eight guys” on an underdog Milwaukee roster he had referred to as  “Average Joes.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The defending World Series champion Dodgers are poised this year to  spend a record $509.5 million in payroll and projected luxury tax.

Milwaukee scored only one run in each of the four games, and Ohtani delivered the final blow with an epic display Friday night. The two-way superstar launched three homers at the plate and struck out 10 in six-plus scoreless innings of two-hit ball on the mound as Los Angeles rolled into the World Series with  a 5-1 victory in Game 4. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “That’s probably one of the best games anybody’s ever played in baseball, I would imagine,” Brewers slugger Christian Yelich said. “Just an awesome performance from him tonight. He’s the best player in the game for a reason and he definitely showed that tonight.” During a regular season to savor, Milwaukee got stingy pitching, played airtight defense, moved runners along and came through with timely hits.  But against the Dodgers, the Brewers were outclassed.  A draining five-game Division Series versus the rival Chicago Cubs and a  tight 2-1 loss in Game 1  of the NLCS appeared to sap Milwaukee’s energy. “I think we obviously had some guys not feeling their best at the plate and we had a couple of them at the same time,” said Yelich, who went 1 for 14 in the series with seven strikeouts. “It’s unfortunate when those rough stretches happen at the same time.” After left-hander Aaron Ashby was used as an opener twice in three games, the Brewers went with veteran left-hander Jose Quintana to start Game 4. But his brand of location and low-velocity breaking balls did not play Friday as Ohtani stole the show. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It’s really hard to do one, and he did two things at the same time,” Quintana said, marveling at Ohtani’s feat. “You stop for a second and look at this guy, it’s unbelievable. We stayed with the plan and it was a great night for him. ... This was not the way we wanted it to end, but at the same time, it was an amazing season for us.” Instead of a dark and somber tone in the locker room, the Brewers had hugs and pats on the back for each other. Instead of waiting a few weeks after the sudden disappointment to appreciate six-plus months of success, they tempered the sting of elimination with gratitude. “Yeah, I think you guys can sense it,” outfielder Blake Perkins said. “We all believe in each other and we love each other. We preached a lot this year the power of friendship and I think this is it. It’s really cool to be a part of. We might not all play together again, so we’re just trying our best to look around and enjoy what we have.” ___ AP MLB:  https://apnews.com/MLB"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/california-plastic-bags-pollution-lawsuit-recyclable-91894490417795f9c455aa9f47ebb93b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"19:57:11Z","title":"California Sues Plastic Bag Manufacturers for False Recyclability Claims","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California has intensified its fight against plastic pollution by suing three major plastic-bag manufacturers — Novolex Holdings, Inteplast Group, and Mettler Packaging — for falsely claiming their bags were recyclable, violating a 2014 law that requires only reusable and recyclable bags at grocery stores.

(AP) — California ramped up its efforts to curb plastic pollution Friday — suing three plastic-bag makers, alleging the companies falsely claimed their products were recyclable. State Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said companies Novolex Holdings, Inteplast Group and Mettler Packaging violated a state law passed in 2014 that banned plastic bags at grocery store checkouts that weren’t recyclable.  Under the law, shoppers could pay 10 cents for thicker plastic bags that needed to be reusable and recyclable. But the makers of the bags labeled them as recyclable even though they were not — recycling facilities cannot process them and they end up dumped in landfills, incinerated, or in the state’s waterways, Bonta said.  “In California, we’re making it clear,” he said at a news conference. “Truth matters. Public trust matters. Environmental protection matters.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The companies did not respond to email and phone requests for comment. The state filed a similar  lawsuit against ExxonMobil  about a year ago over the oil giant’s plastic products. The lawsuit said the company deceived the public by falsely promising that its plastic products would be recycled. The oil giant said California’s recycling system was ineffective and that the state should have worked with the company to keep plastics out of landfills. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The champion Dodgers are dominating October again.

said the remains of another hostage that Hamas handed over the day before were identified as Eliyahu Margalit, as the Palestinian militant group looks for more bodies under the rubble in the Gaza Strip and urges  more aid to be allowed into the embattled  enclave. Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office said Saturday that Margalit’s body was identified after testing by the National Center for Forensic Medicine and his family has been notified. The 76-year-old was abducted on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, from the horse stables where he worked in Kibbutz Nir Oz.  Margalit is the  10th returned hostage  body since the ceasefire went into effect over a week ago. Hamas handed over an 11th body this week, but it wasn’t that of a hostage. The effort to find the remains followed  a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump  that he would green-light Israel to resume the war if Hamas doesn’t live up to its end of the deal and return all hostages’ bodies, totaling 28. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In a statement Saturday, the hostage forum, which supports the families of those abducted, said Margalit’s return brings a measure of solace to his family, but that they won’t rest until the remaining  18 hostages come home.

However, the retrieval of bodies is hampered by the scope of the devastation and the presence of dangerous, unexploded ordnance. The group has also told mediators that some bodies are in areas controlled by Israeli troops. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Margalit’s body was found after two bulldozers plowed up pits in the earth in the city of Khan Younis. As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday also returned the bodies of 15 Palestinians to Gaza. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the International Committee of the Red Cross handed over the bodies to Nasser Hospital, bringing the total number of bodies Israel had returned to 135.  Nine Palestinians killed by Israeli fire Meanwhile, Hamas is accusing Israel of continuing its attacks and violating the ceasefire. On Friday the Civil Defense, a first responders’ agency operating under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said nine people were killed, including women and children, when their vehicle was hit by Israeli fire in Gaza City. The Civil Defense said the car crossed into an Israeli controlled area in eastern Gaza.  As part of the first phase of the ceasefire, Israel still maintains control of about half of Gaza. The Civil Defense said that Israel could have warned the people in a manner that wasn’t lethal. The group recovered the bodies on Saturday with coordination from the U.N., it said.  Israel’s army said it saw a “suspicious vehicle” crossing the yellow line and approaching the army’s troops. It said it fired warning shots but the vehicle continued to approach in a manner that posed an “imminent threat.” It said it acted in accordance with the ceasefire. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Demands for aid Hamas is also urging mediators to increase the flow of aid into Gaza, expedite the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and start reconstruction of the battered territory.  The flow of aid remains constrained because of continued closures of crossings and restrictions on aid groups. United Nations data on Friday showed 339 trucks have been offloaded for distribution in Gaza since the ceasefire began a week ago. Under the agreement, some 600 humanitarian aid trucks would be allowed to enter each day. COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid in Gaza, reported 950 trucks — including commercial trucks and bilateral deliveries — crossing on Thursday and 716 on Wednesday, the U.N. said Gaza’s more than 2 million people are hoping the ceasefire will bring relief from the humanitarian disaster caused by Israel’s offensive. Throughout the war, Israel restricted aid entry to Gaza — sometimes halting it altogether. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Famine was declared in Gaza City, and the U.N. says it has verified more than 400 people who died of malnutrition-related causes, including more than 100 children. Israel says it let in enough food, accusing Hamas of stealing much of it. The U.N. and other aid agencies deny the claim. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government in the territory. Its figures  are seen as a reliable estimate  of wartime deaths by U.N. agencies and many independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross. ——— Magdy reported from Cairo, Egypt ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at  https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1810-10-18","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article outlines a diverse range of global events, including public safety concerns in Kisumu, Kenya, allegations of Israeli abuse against Palestinian prisoners, legal disputes involving a major French banking firm and a New York jury, a proposed Siberia-Alaska pipeline with Elon Musk’s The Boring Company, human rights issues related to Hannibal Gaddafi’s detention in Lebanon, South Korea’s ban on travel to Cambodia due to scam concerns, and a massive workforce reduction in the U.S. nuclear weapons oversight agency.

chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/how-indigenous-knowledge-is-aiding-pakistans-fight-against-climate-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"05:27:09+00:00","title":"How Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In northern Pakistan’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing natural signs like lightning, animal behavior, and unusual sounds—is being used by local communities to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), particularly in the absence of reliable, trusted early warning systems.

2025-10-13T05:27:09+00:00\n\nTitle: How Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change\n\nSkardu, Pakistan  – When Wasiyat Khan was woken up by a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/mexico-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-64-with-dozens-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"21:47:55+00:00","title":"Mexico flooding death toll rises to 64, with dozens still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond caused severe flooding across five Mexican states—primarily Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Puebla—resulting in at least 64 deaths and 65 people still missing.

followed by 21 in Hidalgo, 13 in Puebla and one in Queretaro, Alzua said.\n\nForty-three people are also reported missing in Hidalgo, along with 18 in Veracruz and four in Puebla.\n\nThousands of military troops have been deployed to offer assistance across the five affected states, and governors are also working together to coordinate support, Sheinbaum said.\n\nEarly estimates show that about 100,000 houses have been affected, she added, with some near rivers having “practically disappeared”.\n\nFacing questions about Mexico’s alert system, Sheinbaum said there were no meteorological signs “that could have indicated to us that the rain was going to be of this magnitude”.\n\nMeteorologists have said the rains occurred thanks to the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond, which caused rivers to rapidly rise, leading to flooding and landslides.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall was reported on Wednesday in Veracruz’s city of Cerro Azul and Puebla’s Cuetzalan del Progreso, which saw 280mm and 286mm of rain, respectively, Alzua said.\n\nThe Mexican Army, Air Force and National Guard have jointly implemented response efforts, distributing food and clean water, sometimes by air, to locations otherwise made inaccessible by landslides and road closures.\n\nNearly 400 repair workers have restored more than 80 percent of the electricity supply across the five states, where about 263,000 users lost power, electricity officials said during the briefing."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/12/death-toll-from-mexico-flooding-rises-to-44-dozens-more-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-12","timeOfPublication":"19:18:26+00:00","title":"Death

2025-10-10T01:07:30+00:00\n\nTitle: ‘We don’t want to disappear’: Tuvalu fights for climate action and survival\n\nTuvalu’s Minister of Climate Change Maina Talia has told Al Jazeera that his country is fighting to stay above rising sea levels and needs “real commitments” from other countries that will allow Tuvaluans to “stay in Tuvalu” as the climate crisis worsens.\n\nThe low-lying nation of nine atolls and islands, which is situated between Australia and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, is fighting to maintain its sovereignty by exploring new avenues in international diplomacy.\n\nBut, right now, the country needs help just to stay above water.\n\n“Coming from a country that is barely not one metre above the sea, reclaiming land and building sea walls and building our resilience is the number one priority for us,” Talia told Al Jazeera in an interview during the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\n“We cannot delay any more. Climate finance is important for our survival,” Talia said.\n\n“It’s not about building [over the] next two or three years to come, but right now, and we need it now, in order for us to respond to the climate crisis,” he said.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu’s minister of home affairs and the environment, said the issue of financing will be a key issue at the upcoming UN COP30 climate meeting in Belem, in the Brazilian Amazon, in November.\n\nTuvalu is one of many countries already pushing for a  better deal on climate financing  at this year’s COP, after many advocates left last year’s meeting in Azerbaijan disappointed by the unambitious  $300bn target  set by richer countries.\n\nDescribing the  COP climate meeting  as having become more like a “festival for the oil-producing countries”, Talia said Tuvalu is also exploring a range of alternative initiatives, from a push to create the world’s first fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to seeking to add its entire cultural heritage to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nRepresentatives of oil-producing countries are now attending the COP climate meetings in “big numbers”, Talia said, in order to try and “really bury our voice as small developing countries”.\n\n“They take control of the narrative. They take control of the process. They try to water down all the texts. They try to put a stop to climate finance,” Talia said.\n\n“It’s about time that we should call out to the world that finance is important for us to survive,” he said.\n\n“The polluter pay principle is still there. You pollute, you pay,” he added.\n\nTalia also said that it was frustrating to see his own country struggling to survive, while other countries continue to spend billions of dollars on weapons for current and future wars.\n\n“Whilst your country is facing this existential threat, it’s quite disappointing to see that the world is investing billions and trillions of dollars in wars, in conflicts,” he said.\n\nA report released this week by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) found that 39 small island countries, which are home to some 65 million people, already need about $12bn a year to help them cope with the effects of climate change.\n\nThat figure is many times more than the roughly $2bn a year they are collectively receiving now, and which represents just 0.2 percent of the amount spent on global climate finance worldwide.\n\nGCA, a Rotterdam-based nonprofit organisation, also found that island states are already experiencing an average $1.7bn in annual economic losses due to climate change.\n\nTuvalu is not only focused on its own survival – the island state is considered to be facing one of the most severe existential threats from rising sea levels – it is also continuing to find ways to fight climate change globally.\n\n“That’s why Tuvalu is leading the  Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ,” Talia said.\n\nAbout 16 countries have now signed on to the treaty, with Colombia offering to host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels next year.\n\n“We see its relevance for us,” Talia said of the treaty.\n\n“We want to grow in number in order for us to come up with a treaty, apart from the  Paris Agreement ,” he said.\n\nEven as Tuvalu, a country with a population of less than 10,000 people, is fighting for immediate action on climate change, it is also making preparations for its own uncertain future, including creating a digital repository of its culture so that nothing is lost to the sea.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu’s minister for culture, said that he made the formal preliminary submission to UNESCO two weeks before the UNGA meeting for “the whole of Tuvalu to be listed” on the World Heritage List.\n\n“If we are to disappear, which is something that we don’t want to anticipate, but if worst comes to worst, at least you know our values, our culture, heritage, are well secured,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nLikewise, Talia said his country doesn’t see its 2023 cooperation pact with Australia, which also includes the world’s first climate change migration visa, as an indication that the island’s future is sealed.\n\n“I don’t look at the Falepili Agreement as a way of escaping the issue of climate change, but rather a pathway,” he said.\n\n“A pathway that we will allow our people in Tuvalu to get good education, trained, and then return home,” he said, referring to the agreement giving some Tuvaluans access to education, healthcare and unlimited travel to Australia.\n\nThe agreement text includes an acknowledgement from both parties that “the statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu will continue, and the rights and duties inherent thereto will be maintained, notwithstanding the impact of climate change-related sea level rise”.\n\nTalia also said that a  recent ruling from the UN’s top court , the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, declared that states have a responsibility to address climate change by cooperating to cut emissions, following through on climate agreements, and protecting vulnerable populations and ecosystems from harm.\n\nThe ICJ ruling “really changed the whole context of climate change debates”, Talia said.\n\n“The highest court has spoken, the highest court has delivered the judgement,” he said of the case, which was brought before the ICJ by Tuvalu’s neighbour Vanuatu.\n\n“So it’s just a matter of, how are we going to live that, or weave that, into our climate policies,” he said.\n\n“We need to hold the industrialised countries accountable to their actions,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/11/at-least-28-killed-in-heavy-flooding-caused-by-tropical-storms-in-mexico","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-11","timeOfPublication":"06:38:46+00:00","title":"At least 37 people killed in flooding caused by tropical storms in Mexico","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical storms, including Raymond, Priscilla, and Octave, have caused catastrophic flooding in central and southeastern Mexico, resulting in at least 37 deaths and widespread damage to homes, roads, and power infrastructure.

It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

your beef linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/china-eastern-airlines-to-resume-flights-to-india-after-five-year-freeze","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:20:11+00:00","title":"China Eastern Airlines to resume flights to India after five-year freeze","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China Eastern Airlines is resuming direct flights between Shanghai and Delhi starting November 9, 2025, after a five-year suspension.

period of bloodshed, Afghan officials say.\n\nThe 48-hour truce paused nearly a week of  bloody border clashes  that killed dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides.\n\n“Pakistan has broken the ceasefire and bombed three locations in Paktika” province late on Friday, a senior Taliban official told the AFP news agency, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Afghanistan will retaliate.”\n\nTen civilians were killed and 12 others were wounded in the attacks, a provincial hospital official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that two children were among the dead.\n\nIn a statement released after the attacks, an Afghan government spokesperson said officials from both countries will hold crisis talks in Doha on Saturday.\n\n“As promised, negotiations with the Pakistani side will take place today in Doha,” Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.\n\nA high-level Afghan delegation, led by the Minister of Defence Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob, has left for Doha, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani state TV reported that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and intelligence chief General Asim Malik will be heading to Doha on Saturday for talks with the Afghan Taliban.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Afghanistan Cricket Board said in a statement that three players who were in the region for a tournament were killed in the latest air strikes alongside five other people “in a cowardly attack carried out by the Pakistani regime” and said seven others were injured.\n\nThe ACB said in a post on social media on Saturday that the cricketers were “targeted during a gathering” in Urgun district when they returned home after playing a friendly cricket match in Sharana, the capital of Paktika province.\n\n“The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the ACB said.\n\nIt also said it was withdrawing from the upcoming Tri-Nation T20I Series involving Pakistan, scheduled for next month.\n\nIn Pakistan, a senior security official told AFP that forces had “conducted precision aerial strikes” in Afghan border areas targeting the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, a local faction linked to the  Pakistan Taliban  (TTP).\n\nIslamabad said the same group had been involved in a suicide bombing and gun attack at a military camp in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas district that borders Afghanistan, killing seven Pakistani paramilitary troops.\n\nSecurity issues are at the heart of the tensions, with Pakistan accusing Afghanistan of harbouring armed groups led by the Pakistan Taliban, known by its acronym TTP, on its soil, a claim Kabul denies.\n\nThe cross-border violence had escalated dramatically since last Saturday, days after explosions rocked the Afghan capital, Kabul, just as the Taliban’s foreign minister began an unprecedented visit to India, Pakistan’s longtime rival.\n\nThe Taliban then launched an offensive along parts of its southern border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to say it would launch a strong response of its own.\n\nWhen the truce began at 13:00 GMT on Wednesday, Islamabad said it was to last 48 hours, but Kabul said the ceasefire would remain in

ago.\n\nThe attack happened on Friday evening when a tank shell was fired by Israeli forces at a civilian vehicle carrying the Abu Shaaban family in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to Gaza’s civil defence.\n\nSeven children and three women were among those killed when the Israeli military fired on the vehicle as the family attempted to reach their home to inspect it, civil defence spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said in a statement.\n\n“They could have been warned or dealt with differently,” Basal said, adding that “what happened confirms that the occupation is still thirsty for blood, and insists on committing crimes against innocent civilians.”\n\nHamas condemned what it called a “massacre” and said the family was targeted without justification. The group called on United States President Donald Trump and mediators to pressure Israel to respect the ceasefire agreement.\n\nIn that attack, Israeli soldiers opened fire on people who crossed the so-called “yellow line”, the demarcation to which Israel’s military was supposed to pull back under the ceasefire terms.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Gaza, said many Palestinians lack internet access and are unaware of where Israeli forces remain positioned along the demarcation lines, putting families at risk.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has said that the yellow lines in Gaza will be soon marked out for clarity.\n\nIsraeli forces remain in control of approximately 53 percent of Gaza, Khoudary said.\n\nAs the exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners under the provisions of the deal has continued, Israel has killed at least 28 Palestinians, and heavily restricted the flow of desperately needed aid, including food and medical supplies.\n\nLast week, Israeli forces  killed  five Palestinians in the Shujayea neighbourhood, also in Gaza City.\n\nIsrael has continued to seal the Rafah crossing with Egypt and blocked other key border crossings, preventing large-scale aid deliveries into the enclave.\n\nThe United Nations warned this week that aid convoys are struggling to reach famine-hit areas, with 49 percent of people accessing less than six litres of drinking water per day – well below emergency standards.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it has brought an average of 560 tonnes of food daily into Gaza since the ceasefire began, far below what is needed to address widespread malnutrition and prevent famine.\n\nHamas has said it remains committed to the ceasefire terms, including returning the remains of Israeli captives still under Gaza’s rubble.\n\nThe group  handed over the body  of another captive on Friday evening, bringing the total to 10 since the truce began. Hamas said it needs heavy machinery and excavation equipment to retrieve more remains, but Israel has blocked their entry.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said by blocking heavy equipment and machinery from entering, Israel is creating “a challenge for the residents of Gaza who are experienced and have the expertise to search and to dig out bodies from under the rubble” with that type of equipment."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/dozens-injured-heavy-security-in-kenya-as-odinga-mourned-before-burial","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"11:29:12+00:00","title":"Dozens injured, heavy security in Kenya as Odinga mourned before burial","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of people were injured during a memorial event in Kisumu, Kenya, as massive crowds gathered to view the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who died in India.

Odinga’s body was being transported to his ancestral home in nearby Bondo for burial on Sunday, drawing tens of thousands throughout the region.\n\nThe additional precautions were put in place after violence and chaos killed at least five people during memorial proceedings for the 80-year-old opposition leader and statesman, who collapsed during a  morning walk  in India’s Kerala state on Wednesday.\n\nSiaya Governor James Orengo urged restraint as arrangements progressed for transporting Odinga’s body to his ancestral home in Bondo, approximately 60km (40 miles) west of Kisumu, where the latest disruptions had occurred.\n\n“I really entreat members of the public and the community in general to maintain the peace during this period,” Orengo told local media.\n\nThursday’s initial viewing descended into bloodshed when security forces  fired weapons  and tear gas into crowds surging towards a pavilion where Odinga’s coffin had been placed, killing at least three people at a Nairobi stadium.\n\nA day later, panic swept through mourners exiting Friday’s state funeral service at a separate venue in the capital,  triggering a crowd crush  that killed two more and sent 163 to medical care.\n\nHuge turnout has characterised every stage of the mourning period since Odinga’s body returned home on Thursday, with supporters walking nearly 30km (20 miles) from Nairobi’s airport to escort his remains.\n\nFriday’s state ceremony drew tens of thousands who sang, danced and waved handkerchiefs as they celebrated a figure many affectionately called “Baba” – the Swahili word for father.\n\nDignitaries including President William Ruto and Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud attended the service, where Odinga’s relatives pleaded for peaceful proceedings.\n\nHis brother Oburu told mourners: “Raila should not be teargassed in death. He has been teargassed enough when he was alive.”\n\nFormer United States President Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan, honoured Odinga as “a true champion of democracy” who “endured decades of struggle and sacrifice for the broader cause of freedom and self-governance in Kenya”, in a post on X.\n\nObama noted that Odinga “was willing to choose the path of peaceful reconciliation without compromising his core values”.\n\nOdinga never became president despite five attempts spanning three decades, but shaped Kenya’s democratic evolution more profoundly than many who held that office and has led to an outpouring of grief nationally and across Africa.\n\nHe spearheaded the country’s return to multiparty politics in the 1990s and drove the passage of a landmark 2010 constitution that distributed authority away from centralised executive power."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/does-each-boat-strike-off-the-coast-of-venezuela-save-25000-us-lives","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"04:46:49+00:00","title":"Does each boat strike off the coast of Venezuela save 25,000 US lives? — PolitiFact fact-checks Trump's claim on drug interception operations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump claimed that each military strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 American lives, asserting that the boats carried fentanyl.

States President Donald Trump has said recent military strikes on five  Venezuelan boats  have saved “at least 100,000 lives” because the manoeuvres have thwarted drug smuggling.\n\n“Every boat that we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives, so every time you see a boat and you feel badly you say, ‘Wow, that’s rough’: It is rough, but if you lose three people and save 25,000 people,” President Donald Trump said at an October 15 media conference.\n\nThe administration did not supply PolitiFact with evidence that the boats were carrying  drugs . Drug experts told PolitiFact that Venezuela plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the US. The  legality of the strikes  is also unclear. After the first attack in early September, some legal experts told PolitiFact that the military action was illegal under maritime law or human rights conventions, and the attack contradicted longstanding US military practices.\n\nTrump has used the figure repeatedly and also says he would consider similar strikes on land.\n\n“Every one of those boats is responsible for the death of 25,000 American people, and the destruction of families,” Trump said in an October 5 speech to US Navy sailors. “So when you think of it that way, what we’re doing is actually an act of kindness.\n\n“We’ve taken a very hard stand on drugs … the water drugs – the drugs that come in through water, they’re not coming – there are no boats any more, frankly, there are no fishing boats, there’s no boats out there, period,” Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on October 7. “We’ve probably saved at least 100,000 lives, American lives, Canadian lives, by taking out those boats.”\n\nSeveral aspects of Trump’s statement make it wrong.\n\nThere is no way of knowing how many lives are saved as a result of drug interception efforts, drug experts have told PolitiFact.\n\nAdditionally, if Trump’s statement were accurate, the strikes on five boats in less than two months would have saved nearly double the number of US lives lost to drug overdoses in an entire year.\n\nThe Trump administration hasn’t specified what type of drug or what quantity was on the boats that were struck. So it’s impossible to calculate how many deadly doses could have been destroyed.\n\nTrump said at the October 15 media conference that the boats were carrying fentanyl.\n\n“And you can see it, the boats get hit, and you see that fentanyl all over the ocean,” Trump said. “It’s like floating in bags. It’s all over the place.”\n\nHe has shared  aerial videos  of some of the boat strikes on Truth Social, but no bags of drugs are visible in the videos.\n\nAdditionally, most illicit fentanyl in the US comes from  Mexico , not Venezuela. It enters the US mainly through the southern border at official ports of entry, and it’s smuggled in mostly by US citizens, according to the United States Sentencing Commission.\n\nIf the boats each carried 25,000 lethal doses, that doesn’t mean the strikes stopped 125,000 people from dying of a drug overdose.\n\n“When drugs are seized, the supply chain partially replaces those lost drugs,” Jonathan Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon University drug policy researcher, previously told PolitiFact.\n\nOverdose drug deaths have been declining for the past couple of years, before there were any strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC reported more than 73,000 drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. For Trump’s statement to be accurate, the drugs on five boats would have been responsible for 125,000 deaths, nearly double the number of overdose deaths in one year.\n\nTrump isn’t the first person to equate drug enforcement with saving lives. Over the years, we’ve fact-checked other politicians when they said that a quantity of drugs seized at the US border was enough to kill a specific number of people, or that those seizures saved a specific number of lives.\n\nGenerally, the politicians we have fact-checked referred to fentanyl seizures. The synthetic opioid is the leading cause of US overdose deaths. Politicians’ statements about lives saved rely on the lethal dose for fentanyl, two milligrams. So if authorities seized 10 milligrams of fentanyl, for example, that saved five lives, politicians say.\n\nBut there are caveats to that calculation because a dose’s lethality can vary based on a person’s height, weight and tolerance from past exposure, drug experts say. And statistics about how many drugs were stopped from entering the US don’t account for how many drugs make it into the country.\n\n“We don’t have any method I’m aware of for translating drug seizure data into any measure of overdose deaths averted,” Alene Kennedy-Hendricks, a Johns Hopkins University health policy expert, told PolitiFact in May.\n\nRegarding boat strikes off the coast of Venezuela, Trump said: “Every boat that we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives.”\n\nTrump said the five boats the US military struck off the coast of Venezuela were carrying drugs heading to the US. However, experts on drugs and Venezuela told PolitiFact the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the US.\n\nThe administration has provided no evidence about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats. This lack of information makes it impossible to know how many lethal doses of the drugs could have been destroyed.\n\nEven if the boats were carrying 25,000 lethal drug doses each, that doesn’t mean that destroying them saved 125,000 lives. There were 73,000 US drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. That means the drugs on five boats would have been responsible for 125,000 deaths, nearly double the number of US overdose deaths in one year.\n\nThe amount of drugs that are stopped from entering the US doesn’t indicate how many lives were saved.\n\nWe rate Trump’s statement  False ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/china-expels-top-military-commanders-in-latest-anticorruption-purge","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:53:14+00:00","title":"China expels top military chiefs in anticorruption purge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has expelled two of its highest-ranking military officials—General He Weidong and Admiral Miao Hua—and seven other senior military figures on suspicion of serious corruption and violations of Party discipline.

weapons agency workers due to shutdown\n\nThe administration of United States President Donald Trump has announced that it will furlough about 1,400 workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) starting next week due to the  ongoing shutdown  of the US government.\n\nA spokesman at the Department of Energy, of which the NNSA is a semiautonomous branch, said on Friday that nearly 400 workers would remain at the agency, which is responsible for overseeing the US nuclear weapons stockpile.\n\nPresident Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, said “enough is enough” in a post on X on Friday, as he announced the planned furlough of NNSA workers.\n\n“Starting next week, we’re going to have to furlough thousands of workers that are critical to modernizing our nuclear arsenal because of [Chuck] Schumer’s disastrous Shutdown,” Wright said in his post, referring to the US Senate’s Democratic party leader.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats in the Senate voted against advancing a Republican bill to extend funding to federal agencies for a 10th time, and continuing the government shutdown that has now lasted for 17 days.\n\nStarting next week, we're going to have to furlough thousands of workers that are critical to modernizing our nuclear arsenal because of Schumer’s disastrous Shutdown.\n\nEnough is enough! https://t.co/0jSorVkdkZ\n\n— Secretary Chris Wright (@SecretaryWright)  October 17, 2025\n\nRepublicans have blamed Democrats for the deadlock, as they continue to block the funding legislation to force Republicans to negotiate on healthcare subsidies.\n\nFederal employees categorised as “essential” continue to work without pay during government shutdowns until they can be reimbursed when it ends.\n\nApproximately 750,000 of the US government’s more than two million federal employees have been furloughed so far, along with tens of thousands of federal contractors.\n\nThe NNSA’s federal staff oversee approximately 60,000 contractors, who maintain and test nuclear weapons at national laboratories and other locations across the US.\n\nThe agency also works to secure dangerous nuclear materials around the world, including in Ukraine, where there is an escalating risk of  nuclear disaster  due to Russia’s invasion, according to the United Nations.\n\nNuclear weapons control expert Daryl Kimball, who is the executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan organisation promoting arms control, criticised next week’s potential cuts to NNSA staffing.\n\n“If the Trump administration really thinks the NNSA’s functions are important – and many of them are essential for nuclear facility safety and security – I am sure they can find the funds to keep the workers on the job,” Kimball said.\n\n“Or else, they might want to rethink their position on the federal government shutdown,” he added.\n\nSpeaking to the Bloomberg news organisation on Friday, Energy Secretary Wright warned that modernisation of the US’s nuclear weapons programme will be slowed by the shutdown.\n\n“We’re just getting momentum there … To have everybody unpaid and not coming to work, that will not be helpful,” he said.\n\nThe Energy Department said Wright would visit the National Nuclear Security Site in Nevada on Monday to discuss the impacts of the shutdown.\n\nEarlier this year, NNSA employees were among hundreds of employees in the Energy Department who received termination letters as part of Elon Musk’s  short-lived efforts  to slash government expenditure through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe Trump administration quickly scrambled to rehire the majority of the axed employees, issuing a memo days later rescinding the firings."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/palestinian-detainee-relays-how-torture-in-israeli-prison-made-him-blind","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:06:56Z","title":"Palestinian

blind\n\nMahmoud Abu Foul heard his mother’s voice after eight months in Israeli detention, but could not see her face.\n\nA 28-year-old from northern Gaza, Abu Foul was arrested from Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya in late December and imprisoned in Israeli detention facilities, where he says guards tortured and beat him so severely that he lost his sight.\n\nHe was released this week as part of a United States-brokered ceasefire deal that has seen nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees let out from Israeli jails, many bearing  visible signs of abuse.\n\nAbu Foul, who had already lost his leg in a 2015 Israeli bombing, told Al Jazeera he endured relentless torture during his imprisonment. At Sde Teiman prison, a facility other detainees describe as “the prison that breaks men”, Abu Foul endured repeated beatings and torture.\n\nOne day, guards struck him on the head with such force that he fell unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he discovered he had lost his sight, he said.\n\n“I kept asking for medical treatment, but they only gave me one type of eye drops, which did nothing,” he said. “My eyes kept tearing constantly, with discharge and pain, but no one cared.”\n\nHe tried a hunger strike to demand treatment but said prison authorities did not respond to his demands.\n\nWhen Abu Foul was finally released and transferred to Nasser Hospital, he waited anxiously for his family. He had heard northern Gaza was devastated and feared the worst. Then his mother arrived.\n\n“When I heard her voice, I hugged her tightly,” he said. “I couldn’t see her, but just hearing her was worth the whole world.”\n\nAbu Foul now lives in a tent near ruins, still without treatment for his eyes, and is seeking help to travel abroad for medical care.\n\nHis account aligns with a growing body of evidence documenting systematic abuse in Israeli prisons. Many of the Palestinians released this week emerged emaciated or with visible injuries. One prisoner had lost  nearly half his body weight  during detention.\n\nThe Palestinian Centre for Human Rights documented testimonies from 100 former detainees held between October 2023 and 2024, finding that torture was systematic across all Israeli prison facilities, not just notorious sites like Sde Teiman.\n\nAll were held incommunicado without access to judges, lawyers or family members.\n\nIsrael has returned at least 100 bodies of Palestinians who died in detention. Medical sources told Al Jazeera they found evidence of abuse on some of the corpses, and some indicated possible executions.\n\n“They did not die naturally, they were executed while restrained,” said Dr Munir al-Bursh, director-general of Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that at least 75 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli prisons since October 2023.\n\nIsraeli rights group B’Tselem described the prison system last year as a “network of torture camps” where detainees face systematic physical abuse, are denied food and medical care, and suffer sexual violence.\n\nDespite hundreds of reported abuse cases since October 2023, Israeli authorities have brought indictments in only two incidents, with no prison service personnel charged, according to the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), an Israeli rights group documenting torture.\n\nDr Ruchama Marton, founder of Physicians for Human Rights – Israel, says her decades-long campaign exposed the use of torture in Israel but has failed to stop it. “Maybe people didn’t deny it any more, but in practice it became normalized,” she told Haaretz.\n\nIsrael’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prison service, has defended the harsh treatment of Palestinian prisoners and said “summer camps and patience for the terrorists are over”.\n\nBen-Gvir has also been filmed taunting high-profile Palestinian political leader and detainee Marwan Barghouti.\n\nEarlier this week, Barghouti’s son said he fears for his father’s life in Israeli prison amid reports from witnesses that he was beaten by guards last month.\n\nIn an  interview with Al Jazeera  on Thursday, Arab Barghouti accused Israel of targeting his father because he is a unifying figure among Palestinians.\n\nThe family told media outlets this week that they had received testimonies from Palestinian detainees released as part of  the Gaza ceasefire deal  that Barghouti was beaten by guards in mid-September as he was being transferred between two Israeli prisons.\n\nAbout 9,000 Palestinian prisoners remain in Israeli jails, many without trial or any proper legal process.

Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping,

freed from Cambodia scam centres now home, arrested\n\nDozens of South Korean nationals who had been detained in Cambodia for alleged involvement in cyberscam operations have been returned home and placed under arrest, according to South Korean authorities.\n\nOfficers arrested the individuals on board a chartered flight sent to collect them from Cambodia, a South Korean police official told the AFP news agency.\n\n“A total of 64 nationals just arrived at the Incheon international airport on a chartered flight,” the official said on Saturday, adding that all of the individuals have been taken into custody as criminal suspects.\n\nSouth Korea sent a team to Cambodia earlier this week to investigate dozens of its nationals who were kidnapped into the Southeast Asian nation’s online scam industry.\n\nSouth Korean National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac previously said the detained individuals included both “voluntary and involuntary participants” in scam operations.\n\nOn Friday, Cambodian Ministry of Interior spokesman Touch Sokhak said the repatriation agreement with South Korea was the “result of good cooperation in suppression of scams between the two countries”.\n\nOnline scam operations have proliferated in Cambodia since the COVID-19 pandemic, when the global shutdown saw many Chinese-owned casinos and hotels in the country pivot to illicit operations.\n\nOperating from industrial-scale scam centres, tens of thousands of workers perpetrate online romance scams known as  “pig-butchering” , often targeting people in the West in a vastly lucrative industry responsible for the theft of tens of billions of dollars each year.\n\nPig-butchering – a euphemism for fattening up a victim before they are slaughtered – often involves fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes that build trust over time before funds are stolen.\n\nParallel industries have blossomed in Laos, the Philippines and war-ravaged Myanmar, where  accounts of imprisonment and abuse  in scam centres are the most severe.\n\nAn estimated 200,000 people are working in dozens of large-scale scam operations across Cambodia, with many scam compounds owned by or linked to the country’s  wealthy and politically connected . About 1,000 South Korean nationals are believed to be among that figure.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United States and United Kingdom announced sweeping sanctions against a Cambodia-based multinational crime network, identified as the Prince Group, for running a chain of “scam centres” across the region.\n\nUK authorities seized 19 London properties worth more than 100 million pounds ($134m) linked to the Prince Group, which markets itself as a legitimate real estate, financial services and consumer businesses firm.\n\nProsecutors said that at one point, Prince Group’s chair, Chinese-Cambodian tycoon Chen Zhi, bragged that scam operations were pulling in $30m a day.\n\nChen – who has served as an adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father, long-ruling former Prime Minister Hun Sen – is also wanted on charges of wire fraud and money laundering, according to the UK and US.\n\nStill at large, he faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe move by the UK and US against the Prince Group came as South Korea announced a ban on travel to parts of Cambodia on Wednesday amid growing concerns over its citizens entering the scam industry.\n\nSouth Korean police have said they will also conduct a joint investigation into the recent death of a college student in Cambodia who was reportedly kidnapped and tortured by a crime ring.\n\nThe South Korean student was found dead in a pick-up truck on August 8 in Cambodia’s southern Kampot province, with an autopsy revealing he “died as a result of severe torture, with multiple bruises and injuries across his body”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/thousands-evacuate-philippine-coast-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-approaches","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:05:43+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuate Philippine coast as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a coastal Philippine island, evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approached, with forecasted gusts of up to 80km/h and a risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters.

targeting WhatsApp users, saying the firm’s software causes “direct harm” but slashed an earlier damages award of $168m to just $4m.\n\nIn a ruling on Friday granting WhatsApp owner Meta an injunction to stop NSO’s spyware from being used in the messaging service, district judge Phyllis Hamilton said the Israeli firm’s “conduct causes irreparable harm”, adding that there was “no dispute that the conduct is ongoing”.\n\nHamilton said NSO’s conduct “serves to defeat” one of the key purposes of the service offered by WhatsApp: privacy.\n\n“Part of what companies such as WhatsApp are ‘selling’ is informational privacy, and any unauthorised access is an interference with that sale,” she said.\n\nIn her ruling, Hamilton said that evidence at trial showed that NSO reverse-engineered WhatsApp code to stealthily install its spyware Pegasus on users’ phones, and repeatedly redesigned it to escape detection and bypass security fixes.\n\nNSO was founded in 2010 and is based in the Israeli seaside tech hub of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv.\n\nPegasus – a  highly invasive software  marketed as a tool for law enforcement to fight crime and terrorism – allows operators to remotely embed spyware in devices.\n\nNSO says it only sells the spyware to vetted and legitimate government law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But Meta, which owns WhatsApp, filed a lawsuit in California federal court in late 2019, accusing NSO of exploiting its encrypted messaging service to target journalists, lawyers and human rights activists with its spyware.\n\nIndependent experts have also said NSO’s software has been  used by nation states , some with  poor human rights records , to target critics.\n\nJudge Hamilton said her broad injunction was appropriate given NSO’s “multiple design-arounds” to infect WhatsApp users – including missed phone calls and “zero-click” attacks – as well as the “covert nature” of the firm’s work more generally.\n\nWill Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, said in a statement that the “ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again”.\n\n“We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company,” he said.\n\nMeta had asked Hamilton to extend the injunction to its other products – including Facebook, Instagram and Threads – but the judge ruled there was no way for her to determine if similar harms were being done on the other platforms without more evidence.\n\nHamilton also ruled that an initial award of $168m against NSO for damages to Meta in May this year was excessive, determining that the court did not have “sufficient basis” to support the jury’s initial calculation.\n\n“There have simply not yet been enough cases involving unlawful electronic surveillance in the smartphone era for the court to be able to conclude that defendants’ conduct was ‘particularly egregious’,” Hamilton wrote.\n\nThe judge ruled that the punitive damages ratio should therefore be “capped at 9/1”, reducing the initial sum by about $164m to just $4m."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/6/ai-now-sounds-more-like-us-should-we-be-concerned","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-06","timeOfPublication":"14:46:58+00:00","title":"AI now sounds more like us – should we be concerned?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sophisticated AI voice scam targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, including Giorgio Armani and Patrizio Bertelli, by using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, who was not involved.

received a surprising phone call earlier this year. The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/what-we-know-about-the-torture-abuse-of-palestinian-prisoners-by-israel","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:53:38+00:00","title":"What we know about the torture, abuse of Palestinian prisoners by Israel","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that Israel has tortured and killed over 100 Palestinian detainees since October 2023, with bodies returned to Gaza showing severe physical abuse, burns, missing limbs, and signs of execution.

2025-10-18T05:53:38+00:00\n\nTitle: What we know about the torture, abuse of Palestinian prisoners by Israel\n\nMost of the bodies of the more than  100 dead Palestinians  Israel released remain unidentified.\n\nThey were sent back to Gaza with numbers instead of their names, leaving family members of missing Palestinians to  pore desperately through pictures  of the bodies, hoping to spot their loved ones.\n\nOne thing is clear from the marks left on these bodies, and the blindfolds and handcuffs still on some of them: They had been tortured before their deaths, possibly executed.\n\nThe torture was confirmed by Palestinian detainees released alive by Israel as part of the  Gaza ceasefire deal  that has also seen the release of Israeli captives from Gaza.\n\nReports that Israel tortures Palestinian detainees in its jails have been common for years, and have increased since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, with some Israeli politicians even defending the practice.\n\nAt least 75 Palestinian detainees have also died in Israeli jails since October 7, 2023, according to the United Nations.\n\nOne particularly notable documented incident of abuse was the gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by guards at the notorious  Sde Teiman detention facility  in Israel last year. Verified video shows Israeli prison guards using their shields to hide from the camera before proceeding to rape the victim, who was left unable to walk, Israeli media reported.\n\nThe condition of the bodies Israel returned to Gaza is harrowing.\n\nThe forensic teams who examined them said the bodies showed signs of physical abuse, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\n\nSome of the bodies had missing limbs or teeth, while some appeared to have been burned, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said on Wednesday.\n\n“Crimes that cannot be hidden … This is how the bodies of Gaza’s prisoners were returned – blindfolded, bound like animals, and bearing signs of severe torture and burning,” Dr Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Health Ministry, wrote on social media.\n\n“They did not die naturally – they were executed while restrained, a war crime demanding an urgent international investigation and accountability for the perpetrators.”\n\nImages of the bodies back up much of what al-Bursh said, with experts saying that they showed signs of abuse.\n\nSameh Hamad, part of a commission that received the bodies at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital, said that one of the bodies even had a rope around his neck.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Raed Mohammad Amer, of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society, said his organisation found that Israel had executed dozens of Palestinians. Israel has promised investigations in some cases, but many remain open.\n\nNaji Abbas, director of the prisoners and detainees department for Physicians for Human Rights Israel, said his organisation was “not surprised” at the condition of the bodies released.\n\n“We have recorded hundreds of instances of torture and deaths in the Israeli prison system, dozens of Palestinians who have been killed, beaten to death, or have died after being refused treatment for months,” Abbas said.\n\nOne autopsy the organisation examined showed signs of violence on the body eight months after the person died, he added.\n\n“These are documented cases of detainees’ bodies with clear signs of torture and of having been brutally restrained before death, and still it is not on every television and in every newspaper,” Abbas said.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which coordinates the transfer of Palestinian and Israeli detainees, for comment.\n\nThe ICRC did not comment on the condition of the bodies, but said the focus of its staff was “the dignified transfer of remains of the deceased”.\n\nThe Israeli military and prison service did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNearly 2,000 Palestinians from both Gaza and the occupied West Bank were released by Israel this week as part of the ceasefire deal.\n\nMany of them had been taken by Israel in large roundups, leaving behind families who weren’t sure if their loved one had been killed or was disappeared by Israel.\n\nWithout news of their missing loved ones since their disappearance, the family members were shocked by their appearances and the stories they told.\n\nSome people were so injured and weak, they were taken straight from the transport to a hospital for medical treatment.\n\nOne released detainee, Mahmoud Abu Foul, said Israeli torture had led to him losing his eyesight. Abu Foul told Al Jazeera he lost his eyesight after one beating left him unconscious for hours.\n\nMany detainees emerged emaciated or with visible bruises.\n\nOne freed detainee, Kamal Abu Shanab, said his weight had dropped from 127 to 68 kilogrammes. His niece, Farah, cried as she saw him, saying he was unrecognisable.\n\nAnother freed detainee, Salem Eid, said he can’t lie on his back due to the beatings and has to sleep sitting up.\n\nThere have been reports of abuse in Israeli prisons for years.\n\nIsraeli rights group B’Tselem said in a report last August the Israeli prison system was a “network of torture camps” with “frequent acts of severe, arbitrary violence; sexual assault; humiliation and degradation; deliberate starvation; forced unhygienic conditions; sleep deprivation; prohibition on, and punitive measures for, religious worship; confiscation of all communal and personal belongings; and denial of adequate medical treatment”.\n\nThen there is the psychological torture. One man released this week said he was told by Israeli soldiers that his family was dead, only to find them alive, and another who had prepared a bracelet for his two-year-old daughter, only to discover that she, along with his wife and other children, had been killed by Israel.\n\nThere are still about 9,000 Palestinian detainees still in Israeli jails – one of the most prominent is  Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti , who Israel refuses to release.\n\nBarghouti was found guilty by Israel in 2004 of being responsible for attacks against Israelis and is serving several life sentences.\n\nHe refuses to accept the jurisdiction of the Israeli court system and endorses nonviolent resistance, as well as a two-state solution.\n\nPolls regularly find Barghouti to be the most popular Palestinian leader, and he has often been compared to the anti-apartheid leader and former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n\nBarghouti’s son, Arab, told Al Jazeera this week that Israel has singled his father out for exceptionally harsh treatment, including a beating by guards in mid-September that left him unconscious.\n\nOne released prisoner, Mohammad al-Ardah, said that Israeli forces had broken Barghouti’s ribs in three places.\n\nIsrael has denied the mistreatment of Barghouti and other Palestinian prisoners, but has not substantiated that defence with evidence.\n\nFar-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir appeared in an  August video shouting at and threatening Barghouti . He is the man in charge of Israel’s prison service.\n\nArab Barghouti said Ben-Gvir showed his father an electric chair and told him it was his fate.\n\nBen-Gvir has taken pride in the treatment of Palestinian prisoners under his watch, and defended soldiers alleged to have abused the detainees, saying that “summer camps and patience for the terrorists are over”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/18/live-israel-kills-28-in-gaza-since-ceasefire-hamas-urges-accountability","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:59:27+00:00","title":"Israel sends more Palestinian bodies to Gaza as torture concerns grow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has reportedly sent 135 Palestinian bodies to Gaza, many of which show signs of torture and execution, fueling international concern over possible war crimes.

The plaintiffs—two men and one woman, now American citizens—claimed they suffered severe torture, burning, and sexual assault under the regime and that BNP Paribas’s services were a 'natural and adequate cause' of the harm. The verdict follows a five-week trial, with the jury rejecting the defense’s claim of no link between the bank’s operations and the violence. BNP Paribas previously paid $8.97 billion in penalties for sanctions violations, and the US recognized the conflict as genocide in 2004. The case underscores growing global pressure on financial institutions to hold themselves accountable for enabling human rights abuses, especially in authoritarian regimes. Despite defense arguments that the bank had no knowledge of abuses and that Sudan committed crimes independently, the jury concluded that the bank’s financial support directly sustained the regime responsible for ethnic cleansing. The broader context includes the 2019 ousting of al-Bashir, ongoing political instability, and renewed violence between military factions and the RSF, indicating that the legacy of past atrocities

AFP news agency that the ruling “is clearly wrong and there are very strong grounds to appeal the verdict”.\n\nBobby DiCello, who represented the plaintiffs, called the verdict “a victory for justice and accountability”.\n\n“The jury recognised that financial institutions cannot turn a blind eye to the consequences of their actions,” DiCello said.\n\n“Our clients lost everything to a campaign of destruction fuelled by US dollars, that BNP Paribas facilitated and that should have been stopped,” he said.\n\nBNP Paribas “has supported the ethnic cleansing and ruined the lives of these three survivors”, DiCello said during closing remarks on Thursday.\n\nThe French bank, which did business in Sudan from the late 1990s until 2009, provided letters of credit that allowed Sudan to honour import and export commitments.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that these assurances enabled the regime to keep exporting cotton, oil and other commodities, enabling it to receive billions of dollars from buyers that helped finance its operations.\n\nDefence lawyer Dani James argued, “There’s just no connection between the bank’s conduct and what happened to these three plaintiffs.”\n\nThe lawyer for BNP Paribas also said the French bank’s operations in Sudan were legal in Europe and that global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) partnered with the Sudanese government during the same period.\n\nDefence lawyers also claimed that the bank had no knowledge of human rights violations occurring at that time.\n\nThe plaintiffs would have “had their injuries without BNP Paribas”, said lawyer Barry Berke.\n\n“Sudan would and did commit human rights crimes without oil or BNP Paribas,” Berke said.\n\nThe verdict followed a five-week jury trial conducted by US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who last year denied a request by BNP Paribas to get the case thrown out ahead of trial.\n\nHellerstein wrote in his decision last year that there were facts showing a relationship between BNP Paribas’s banking services and abuses perpetrated by the Sudanese government.\n\nBNP Paribas had in 2014 agreed to plead guilty and pay  an $8.97bn penalty  to settle US charges it transferred billions of dollars for Sudanese, Iranian and Cuban entities subject to economic sanctions.\n\nThe US government recognised the Sudanese conflict as a genocide  in 2004 .

announced?\n\nThe Nobel Prizes 2025 have officially kicked off with the first award for physiology or medicine announced, setting the stage for a week of global anticipation.\n\nScientists Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi on Monday were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for “their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.\n\n“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.\n\nThe full schedule, spanning through October 13, maps out a rapid succession of announcements: medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace and finally the economics prize.\n\nHere are details of the schedule and what to expect from this year’s Nobel Prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist best known for discovering dynamite.\n\nIn his 1895 will, Nobel left the bulk of his fortune to fund the annual prizes, recognising those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” in the preceding year.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.\n\nThe prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet (for medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (for peace).\n\nEach laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma and a cash award funded by the Nobel Foundation, which manages Nobel’s endowment. This year’s prizes amount to 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m) each.\n\nThe prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcements began on Monday and will end a week later on October 13.\n\nMonday, October 6:  physiology or medicine\n\nAnnounced by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Wallenbergsalen, Nobel Forum, Solna, near Stockholm\n\nTuesday, October 7:  physics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nWednesday, October 8:  chemistry\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThursday, October 9 : literature\n\nAnnounced by the Swedish Academy, Stockholm\n\nFriday, October 10:  peace\n\nAnnounced at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Oslo, by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nMonday, October 13:  economics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThe nomination process is designed to preserve secrecy and independence. Each year, the Nobel committees invite selected experts, past winners and academics to submit nominations by January 31.\n\nThe nominations are not made public, and committee members are forbidden from discussing their decisions for 50 years. Only nominators may choose to reveal their own submissions.\n\nA person cannot nominate themselves, but they can be nominated multiple times by others.\n\nAfter the deadline, committees spend months reviewing hundreds of entries, consulting specialists and narrowing the list to a few candidates.\n\nEach prize has its own rhythm. The Peace Prize, which often recognises work from the past year, tends to be responsive to current global events.\n\nThe science prizes usually take decades to confirm after judges observe that discoveries have stood the test of time and can gauge their impact.\n\nThe world is fraught with conflict, including an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a war in Ukraine, and civil wars and political repression in numerous countries.\n\nHowever, the headlines and debates about this year’s Nobel Peace Prize are rather outsized and focused on United States President Donald Trump for his relentless self-promotion – at times, claiming to deserve it for “ending seven wars”.\n\nAt the United Nations, Trump told delegates, “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that he “deserved” to win the prize for the possibility of ending an eighth war, Israel’s two-year-long war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that his chances are slim. The Norwegian Nobel Committee typically focuses on the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals, experts argued.\n\nAmong this year’s nominations for Trump were those from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pakistan’s government although both were made after the deadline for the 2025 award.\n\nOne of the Nobel-awarding bodies has also warned that academic freedom is under threat from the political interference by the Trump administration.\n\nYlva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the Trump administration’s changes were reckless. “I think in both the short and long term, it can have devastating effects,” she told the Reuters news agency in an interview. “Academic freedom … is one of the pillars of the democratic system.”\n\nHowever, Engstrom is not herself on any of the three committees that will award the prizes for chemistry, physics or economics.\n\nEvery year, the Nobel Prizes are formally awarded in twin ceremonies held in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony is attended by Sweden’s royal family, and the laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and economic sciences receive their medals and diplomas from the king.\n\nIn Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize is presented by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the Oslo City Hall, honouring Nobel’s wish that the Peace Prize be awarded in Norway.\n\nLaureates are individually called to the stage, where they receive the Nobel medal, diploma and the monetary award. The ceremony also features speeches by committee chairpeople highlighting the significance of the discoveries and contributions.\n\nThe event is broadcast worldwide and followed by a Nobel Banquet at Stockholm’s City Hall for more than 1,000 guests, including royalty, diplomats, scientists and past laureates.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the 2024 prize for medicine for discovering microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression after transcription.\n\nIn physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the prize for research that laid the theoretical and computational foundations of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. While Hopfield’s models in the 1980s linked neuroscience and computation, Hinton’s work revolutionised deep learning, enabling advances in image recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn chemistry, the prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using computational models. Baker was honoured for developing algorithms that enable scientists to design new proteins with specific functions while Hassabis and Jumper from Google’s DeepMind were recognised for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that predicted nearly all known protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the literature category, the prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist known for her haunting explorations of violence, identity and collective memory. Best known internationally for the novels The Vegetarian and Human Acts, Han was cited “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.\n\nIn the peace category, the prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, honouring its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve the testimonies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.\n\nIn economic sciences, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson shared the prize for their analysis of how institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality. Their collaborative research, including the seminal work Why Nations Fail, demonstrated that inclusive political and economic institutions rather than geography or culture determine prosperity."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1510-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including Apple’s strategic move ahead of US-China trade talks, the spread of misinformation via social media influencers using AI-generated content, a new US AI transparency law described as 'light touch', and the award of the Nobel Prize to chemist Omar M.

controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters\n\nChina tightened export controls for critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpn5pv4eko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"11:36:58.130+00:00","title":"Kenya: Mourners bid farewell to ex-PM Raila Odinga in his political heartland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the widespread mourning of Raila Odinga, the late former Prime Minister of Kenya, who died in India at age 80.

China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8drqm4mqpno","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:20:05.950+00:00","title":"Over 60 South Koreans repatriated from Cambodia over alleged scams","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 60 South Koreans, including those arrested during a Cambodian crackdown and others who turned themselves in, have been repatriated to South Korea from Cambodia following allegations of involvement in online scams.

menopause'\n\nA woman has described how she quit her job after she thought she was \"losing her mind\" while she was suffering loneliness, anxiety and confusion which turned out to be symptoms of menopause.\n\nLeonie Painter from Moston in Manchester said she did not know why she felt that way and did not think she could talk to others about it when the symptoms began to develop after the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe 50-year-old said: \"It was only after learning what was causing it that I began to feel better, but it's taken a long time to get to this point.\"\n\nFollowing her experience, she started a group for women going through menopause that has come to be described as a \"lifeline\" by those who attend.\n\nThe sessions started in September 2024 at the Harpurhey Neighbourhood Centre, and were originally set up as a 12-session menopause group.\n\nMs Painter said the aim was to break the stigma around menopause by giving women a space to talk and discuss subjects such as \"brain fog\" with others who understand, to increase their knowledge of perimenopause and menopause, and bust myths.\n\nIt has proved so successful it is now a weekly community group funded by the Winning Hearts and Minds initiative under Manchester City Council and Jigsaw Housing which provides targeted community-based funding.\n\nMs Painter said her experiences meant she knew how important it was to break the stigma around menopause and empower women by giving them a safe space to talk.\n\nShe said the hub's message was \"menopause doesn't mean your life is ending, it's a new chapter\".\n\nLiza Davies, from Collyhurst, Manchester, said the hub has been a \"lifeline\" for her.\n\nShe suffered the most challenging period of her life from September 2024, and said she felt like taking her own life \"most days\" as well as being \"agitated and angry but could not understand why\".\n\nThe 46-year-old said: \"I was overwhelmed, confused, and felt like I was losing my mind.\n\n\"The physical symptoms were relentless, and the emotional toll was even harder to explain.\"\n\n\"It truly saved me,\" she said, adding it enabled her to not only manage her symptoms but move \"from surviving to thriving\".\n\nLiza said the hub \"offered clarity, compassion, and connection when I needed it most\".\n\nShe said \"I found a community that understood me, resources that empowered me, and support that made me feel less alone.\"\n\nLiza said: \"I am not 100% there yet but I have come a long way.\n\n\"I have started to rebuild my life and with time, patience and the

Moston, Manchester, joined the hub - which offers expert talks covering everything from symptoms and HRT, to bone health, lifestyle and mindfulness - almost a year ago when her GP suggested it after struggling with severe symptoms.\n\nThe 60-year-old said the \"difference for me has been astounding\".\n\n\"I left my job because I thought I had serious health issues linked to menopause symptoms,\" she said.\n\n\"My confidence had taken a knock and unknowingly I was suffering depression and high anxiety.\"\n\nShe said the group has given her \"vital information and support\" and connections with mental health and physical health practitioners.\n\n\"I have received the correct medication for my menopause and mental health issues, I have joined a small gym run by the hub leader and I'm now investing in myself.\n\n\"My strength and confidence have been boosted and my understanding of what is happening to my body and mind has improved dramatically.\"\n\nShe has also become a \"menopause champion\" and passes on what she has learned to others.\n\nDeena said: \"The hub is so important because it gives correct, up-to-date information, establishes important links with medical and mental health services, and improves the lives of women.\"\n\nThe NHS Greater Manchester Integrated Care is hoping the menopause hub model will now extend across Manchester and beyond.\n\nListen to the best

While climate change is known to increase marine heatwaves, the extreme temperatures surpass predictions from climate models, suggesting an additional influence. Scientists attribute the warming to reduced cooling effects from sulphur dioxide emissions in shipping fuels and air pollution controls in China, which eliminated natural aerosol reflectivity. This warming has already contributed to extreme weather in Japan and South Korea and intensified thunderstorms in California due to atmospheric rivers. More importantly, the heatwave may influence UK and European winter weather through teleconnections, potentially leading to a colder start to winter due to atmospheric high-pressure systems drawn from the Arctic. This effect is compounded by weak La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific, which together increase the likelihood of colder conditions in the UK during early winter, though long-term climate trends

Mysterious 'warm blob' breaks records in the North Pacific Ocean\n\nThe waters of the north Pacific have had their warmest summer on record, according to BBC analysis of a mysterious marine heatwave that has confounded climate scientists.\n\nSea surface temperatures between July and September were more than 0.25C above the previous high of 2022 - a big increase across an area roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean.\n\nWhile climate change is known to make marine heatwaves more likely, scientists are struggling to explain why the north Pacific has been so hot for so long.\n\nBut all this extra heat in the so-called \"warm blob\" may have the opposite effect in the UK, possibly making a colder start to winter more likely, some researchers believe.\n\n\"There's definitely something unusual going on in the north Pacific,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.\n\nSuch a jump in temperatures across a region so large is \"quite remarkable\", he added.\n\nThe BBC analysed data from the  European Copernicus climate service  to calculate average temperatures between July and September across a large area of the north Pacific, sometimes known as the \"warm blob\".\n\nThe region extends from the east coast of Asia to the west coast of North America, the same area used in previous  scientific studies .\n\nThe figures show that not only has the region been warming quickly over the past couple of decades, but 2025 is markedly higher than recent years too.\n\nThat the seas are getting hotter is no surprise. Global warming, caused by humanity's emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, has already trebled the number of days of extreme heat in oceans globally, according to  research published earlier this year .\n\nBut temperatures have been even higher than most climate models - computer simulations taking into account humanity's carbon emissions - had predicted.\n\nAnalysis of these models by  the Berkeley Earth group  suggests that sea temperatures observed across the north Pacific in August had less than a 1% chance of occurring in any single year.\n\nNatural weather variability is thought to be part of the reason. This summer has seen weaker-than-usual winds, for example. That means more heat from the summer sunshine can stay in the sea surface, rather than being mixed with cooler waters below.\n\nBut this can only go so far in explaining the exceptional conditions, according to Dr Hausfather.\n\n\"It certainly is not just natural variability,\" he said. \"There's something else going on here as well.\"\n\nOne intriguing idea is that a recent change to shipping fuels might be contributing to the warming. Prior to 2020, dirty engine oil produced large amounts of sulphur dioxide, a gas harmful to human health.\n\nBut that sulphur also formed tiny, Sun-reflecting particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols, which helped to keep a lid on rising temperatures.\n\nSo removing that cooling effect in shipping hotspots like the north Pacific could be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming.\n\n\"It does seem like sulphur is the primary candidate for what's driving this warming in the region,\" said Dr Hausfather.\n\nOther  research suggests  that efforts to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities has played a role in warming the Pacific too.\n\nThat dirty air did a similar job to shipping in reflecting sunlight away, while cleaning it up could have had the unintended consequence of allowing more ocean heating.\n\nThe north Pacific's marine heatwave has already had consequences for weather on both sides of the Pacific, likely boosting very high summer temperatures in Japan and South Korea and storms in the US.\n\n\"In California, we've seen supercharged thunderstorms because the warm ocean waters in the Pacific provide heat and moisture,\" said Amanda Maycock, professor in climate dynamics at the University of Leeds.\n\n\"In particular, there are things we call atmospheric rivers… bands of air, which contain very high amounts of moisture that fuel themselves from the ocean waters,\" she added.\n\n\"So if we have warm ocean waters… they can then bring a lot of moisture onto the land, which then falls out as rain, or in the wintertime can precipitate out as snow.\"\n\nLong-term weather forecasting is always challenging, but extreme heat in the north Pacific has the potential to affect the UK and Europe in the coming months too.\n\nThat's because of relationships between weather in different parts of the world known as teleconnections.\n\n\"Although the current warm conditions are located in the north Pacific, these can generate wave motions in the atmosphere that can alter our weather downstream into the north Atlantic and into Europe,\" said Prof Maycock.\n\n\"That can tend to favour high-pressure conditions over the continent, which brings us more of an influence from the Arctic, where we have colder air,\" she added.\n\n\"That can be drawn over Europe and bring us colder weather in early winter.\"\n\nA colder outcome is by no means certain, as this is a complex area of science. Several other weather patterns also affect UK winters, which are typically getting milder with climate change.\n\nAnd a warm north Pacific appears to have different effects later in the winter, favouring milder and wetter conditions in some parts of Europe.\n\nAnother factor to throw into the mix is what's happening further south in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nThere, surface waters are unusually cool - a classic sign of the weather phenomenon known as  La Niña .\n\nLa Niña, and its warm sibling El Niño, are natural patterns, although  research published this week  highlighted that global warming could itself impact the swings between them.\n\nWeak La Niña conditions are expected to persist over the next few months, according to NOAA, the US science agency.\n\nAll else being equal, La Niña generally increases the risk of a cold start to winter in the UK, but also brings a higher chance of a mild end,  the Met Office says .\n\n\"These two drivers in the north and tropical Pacific will be acting together this winter,\" said Prof Maycock.\n\n\"But since the La Niña is quite weak this year, the extreme warmth in the north Pacific could be more important for forecasting the winter ahead.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Muskeen Liddar and Libby Rogers\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter  to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

Venezuela 'drug sub'\n\nA US military attack on a ship allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela left two survivors who have reportedly been captured by US forces and are being held aboard a Navy ship.\n\nThe attack, which took place on Thursday, is at least the sixth US strike on Venezuelan ships in recent weeks. It was the first time that survivors have been reported.\n\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed the attack on Friday, calling the vessel a \"drug-carrying submarine\".\n\nTrump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".\n\nThe two survivors of the attack were rescued by a US military helicopter, and were then shuttled onto a US warship in the Caribbean, unnamed US officials have told US media.\n\nThe news of the survivors has not been officially confirmed by the US government.\n\nWhen asked about the survivors on Friday, Trump defended the ongoing attacks, which have so far killed around 27 people.\n\n\"We attacked a submarine, and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs,\" the president told reporters at the White House.\n\n\"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that the US attacks are targeting \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nBoth Trump and Rubio declined to address reports of survivors, but Rubio said that more information about the attack would be provided later on Friday.\n\nLittle is known about the groups that have been attacked, and the Trump administration has not provided additional details.\n\nUN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".\n\nOn Thursday, the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago said it was investigating whether two of its citizens had been killed in a US attack. Trinidad and Tobago are located only a few miles off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela's UN Ambassador Samuel Moncada mourned the two killed, who were reportedly fishermen, and called for the UN Security Council to intervene.\n\n\"There is a killer prowling the Caribbean,\" Moncada said during a UN speech. \"People from different countries…are suffering the effects of these massacres.\"\n\nMaduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested, has appealed for peace with the US.\n\nThe increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. There are reportedly about 10,000 US forces built up in the Caribbean, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, a US territory. US Air Force B-52 bombers also circled over the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday for several hours.\n\nThis week, Trump told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.\n\nOn Friday, he used an expletive to warn Venezuela against undermining US interests.\n\nNarco-subs have been a growing trend in recent years. They have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade, constructed using fibreglass and plywood.\n\nSubs have been found carrying as much as three tonnes of cocaine, with destinations including the US and Europe.\n\nThe US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ep8gd1qv3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"21:53:26.814+00:00","title":"After all those scandals, why did Prince Andrew quit his titles now?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has voluntarily given up all remaining royal titles — including Duke of York, Knight of the Garter, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh — in response to a cascade of scandals, particularly concerning his alleged continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein.

Andrew has given up the use of his titles and honours.\n\nHe can no longer sign off as the Duke of York, or put \"KG\", a Knight of the Garter, after his name, with a flourish of medieval chivalry.\n\nThe Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh are also scratched off his list of titles, with \"Andrew Inverness\" a name he'd sometimes used in his business dealings.\n\nBut what's caused this sudden announcement? Particularly as this dramatic move, removing the remaining vestiges of his royal life, comes with an assertion of his innocence and that he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".\n\nPrince Andrew has voluntarily given up the use of his titles - but he was clearly under pressure to jump before he was pushed.\n\nThis way, the changes in his status are kept in-house and there doesn't have to be the intervention of Parliament, which would have needed to legislate to take away his title as Duke of York.\n\nThat would have been messy, but the Palace was already sending signals it was prepared to take action, and it was confident that Parliament, and popular opinion, would have supported such a change.\n\nAllowing Andrew to voluntarily give up his titles, which theoretically remain in place, gave him a way out, still holding on to a little of the disappearing vapour trail of his pride.\n\nBut it's no secret that Buckingham Palace was exasperated with the scandals surrounding Prince Andrew and what a royal source calls the \"constant parade of headlines\".\n\nHe was one of their \"Dukes of Hazard\" that kept making news for all the wrong reasons.\n\nQuestions about Andrew's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were drowning out the work of the rest of the Royal Family. That was on top of unanswered questions about Andrew's finances and his connections to an alleged Chinese spy.\n\nNext week will see a historic state visit by the King and Queen to meet Pope Leo at the Vatican, and there was a deep irritation that such a solemn occasion was going to be overshadowed by lurid stories about Andrew and Epstein.\n\nAccording to royal sources, a \"tipping point\" had been reached and something had to be done.\n\nArguably that should have happened earlier. But that would also have meant the Palace publicly accepting that it had a responsibility for Prince Andrew, when it had so long argued that as a \"non-working royal\", his problems were his own to resolve.\n\nBut this latest move shows a recognition that even if Andrew isn't a royal responsibility, it's still their reputation he's been damaging.\n\nWhat added to the sense of this no longer being a tenable position was an email published last weekend that showed Prince Andrew had stayed in touch with Epstein longer than he had claimed in  his BBC Newsnight interview .\n\nA royal source said this was a significantly different moment when there were such clear \"fault lines\" exposed in Prince Andrew's version of events.\n\nCuriously, the same email had been  partially published in January  - again showing that Andrew had not cut ties to Epstein when he had claimed - but this time in October the impact has been like the pebble that has started an avalanche.\n\nIt followed a similar awkwardness for Sarah Ferguson, where a private email contradicted her own public claims to have cut links with Epstein.\n\nAnd it added to the pressure from extracts published from a posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, the Epstein victim who had reached a financial settlement with Prince Andrew, and had earlier this year taken her own life.\n\nMs Giuffre's memoir, to be published next week, once again casts Andrew into toxic associations with Epstein.\n\nAnd the book's accusation that Prince Andrew was \"entitled\" echoed the title of a recent biography of Prince Andrew, by Andrew Lownie, that took another wrecking ball to his reputation.\n\nIt's been a landslide of bad news, month after month, that showed no sign of losing momentum. He'd become the disastrous football manager, or the damaged political leader, who had no obvious way of being removed. Particularly when it was like a football manager whose brother was the chairman.\n\nThere's always a tension between protecting an institution and a reluctance to remove the individuals within it. Even more so when the institution is also a family.

Prince Andrew's decision is just the beginning in the committee's work to deliver justice for the survivors.\"\n\nPrince Andrew has always denied wrongdoing but this has become a global story.\n\nWhen US President Trump arrived for his state visit, it was a picture of Andrew and Epstein that protesters projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle.\n\nPrince Andrew's decision to step away from his remaining titles will also mean he stays in step with his ex-wife, who is no longer the Duchess of York. They are back to where they began when they first met - as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.\n\nThey still live together and as Prince Andrew has his own long lease on Royal Lodge, they'll carry on there as before.

finds\n\nScientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago.\n\nThe male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says.\n\nMursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft.\n\nNow, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died.\n\nAccording to the paper , the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood.\n\nAll showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips.\n\nAll of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\".\n\nDNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area.\n\nThe paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts.\n\nThe researchers believe the men were likely victims of the  'Crisis of the Third Century' , most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\".\n\nThe paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area.\n\nIt notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events.\n\nGiven the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil.\n\nMursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dqew8l3xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:42:19.848+00:00","title":"Zelensky fails to secure Tomahawk missiles at talks with Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to secure the supply of Tomahawk cruise missiles, which he believes could severely weaken Russia's war economy by targeting its energy infrastructure.

after US President Donald Trump indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said after the cordial bilateral talks that he and Trump had talked about long-range missiles, but decided not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".\n\nFollowing the meeting, Trump took to social media to call for Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end the war.\n\nThe Trump-Zelensky meeting came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone and agreed to meet him in Hungary soon.\n\nZelensky believes using Tomahawks to strike at Russian oil and energy facilities would severely weaken Putin's war economy.\n\nWhile Trump did not rule it out, his tone at the White House on Friday was non-committal.\n\n\"Hopefully they won't need it, hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks,\" the US president said, adding: \"I think we're fairly close to that.\"\n\nHe described the weapons as \"a big deal\" and said that the US needed them for its own defence. He also said that supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine could mean a further escalation in the conflict, but that discussions about sending them would continue.\n\nAsked by the BBC if the Tomahawks had prompted Putin to meet Trump, the US president said: \"The threat of that [the missiles] is good, but the threat of that is always there.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian leader suggested his country could offer drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, prompting smiles and nodding from Trump.\n\nZelensky also complimented Trump on his role in securing the first phase of a peace deal in the Middle East, suggesting the US leader could build on that momentum to help end Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter the meeting, Zelensky was asked by a reporter outside the White House if he thought Putin wanted a deal or was just buying time with the planned meeting with Trump in Budapest.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, adding that the prospect of Ukraine having Tomahawks had caused Russia to be \"afraid because it is a strong weapon\".\n\nAsked if he was leaving Washington more optimistic that Ukraine would get the Tomahawks, he said: \"I am realistic.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also appeared to suggest he would be amenable to Trump's suggestion of stopping the war along the current front line.\n\n\"We have to stop where we are, he is right, the president is right,\" Zelensky said. He added that the step after that would be \"to speak\".\n\nHe later posted on X, saying that he had called European leaders to share details of the meeting with Trump, adding that the \"main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe.\"\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call with European leaders was \"productive\" and promised that \"the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support\".\n\nWhile Trump had shown an openness to the idea of selling the Tomahawks in recent days, Putin warned that such a move would further strain the US-Russian relationship.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks soon in Hungary - although no date has been set.\n\nAsked by a reporter on Friday if he was concerned Putin might be playing for time by agreeing to a new summit, Trump said: \"I am.\"\n\n\"But I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well. So, it's possible, a little time, it's alright. But I think that I'm pretty good at this stuff. I think that he wants to make a deal,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked by another reporter   whether Zelensky would be involved in the prospective talks in Budapest, Trump - who was sat beside the Ukrainian president  said there was \"bad blood\" between Putin and Zelenksy.\n\n\"We want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump said. \"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\" He added that the three leaders \"have to get together\".\n\nThe US president said his call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow would meet next week.\n\nTrump had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war, but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough.\n\nThey spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.\n\nBack in Ukraine, the BBC spoke on Friday to a couple repairing the small store they own in a suburb of Kyiv, after it was obliterated by Russian missiles last month.\n\nWhen the store-owner, Volodymyr, was asked about Trump's forthcoming summit meeting with Putin, he began to say: \"We appreciate all support\".\n\nBut he stepped away as tears welled up in his eyes. After a long pause, he composed himself and started again.\n\n\"Truth and democracy will win, and all the terrorism and evil will disappear,\" he said. \"We just want to live, we don't want to give up, we just want them to leave us alone.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgkd40yypwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:57:56.125+00:00","title":"Can Putin's Flying Kremlin travel through EU airspace to Budapest?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A potential summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump is being discussed, with Budapest proposed as a venue.

stone, but if Russia's Vladimir Putin does go to Budapest to meet US President Trump in the next two weeks, he would need to clear a few hurdles first.\n\nWhen Putin travelled to Alaska for his Anchorage summit in August, the US granted special permission for the presidential plane - a modified Ilyushin Il-96 airliner dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\" that has four engines and is bristling with defence systems.\n\nRussian planes are banned from US airspace, and from EU airspace too. So if Putin does fly to Budapest he would need special dispensation if he decided to fly over an EU member state.\n\nIt is perfectly possible, but landlocked Hungary is not the easiest destination to get to for a Russian president who rarely sets foot abroad and has not travelled to the EU for years.\n\n\"For now, of course, it's not clear,\" says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"What we do have is the willingness of the presidents to hold such a meeting.\"\n\nDays after Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU froze the assets of both its leader and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nA blanket ban was also imposed on all Russian aircraft flying through the airspace of all 27 EU countries. Hungary and many of its neighbours are Nato member states too.\n\nPutin has also been accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of war crimes of unlawfully deporting and transferring of Ukrainian children to Russia.\n\nSo there are complications, although Hungary believes they can all be sorted out. Hungary is in the process of pulling out of the ICC anyway.\n\nPutin and Hungary's Viktor Orban, probably his closest ally in the EU, have already discussed the planned summit over the phone, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has told reporters \"we will of course ensure that he can enter Hungary, hold successful talks here, and then return home\".\n\nThe EU is unlikely to create obstacles either.\n\nIts executive commission has said any meeting that moves forward \"a just and lasting peace for Ukraine\" is welcome and it supports President Trump's efforts towards that.\n\nOne of the main drivers for its latest proposed sanctions on Russia - the 19th package so far - is to bring the Russians to the negotiating table, it says. And it points out there's no travel ban on Putin, only an asset freeze.\n\nThe biggest sticking point is how Russia's leader will fly from Moscow to Budapest. Clearly he will not be buying an Air Serbia ticket to Belgrade and catching the train to Hungary, which may be the most direct route to take.\n\nHe will want his Il-96 plane to guarantee his safety, but that will probably mean using the airspace of an EU and Nato member state and obtaining permission to break the EU's ban on Russian planes.\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said on Friday that \"in terms of the direction of travel, member states can give derogations but it must be given by member states individually\".\n\nNato has also referred the issue to respective national authorities, and as Trump is involved they may acquiesce.\n\nEven with dispensation, a look at the map shows Putin may have to take a circuitous route. Ukraine is out of the question, and probably Poland too because of Warsaw's icy relations with Moscow.\n\nPerhaps the most direct route goes via the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Turkey, through Bulgaria and either Serbia or Romania into Hungary.\n\nSerbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, knows Putin well and Air Serbia has direct flights to Moscow over EU airspace. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU but is not a member.\n\nIt is the EU countries, Bulgaria or perhaps Romania, that would need to give consent, and they would have to escort Putin's plane through their airspace.\n\nRomania has what is set to become the biggest Nato base in Europe, and Bulgaria is also building a Nato base as part of efforts to shore up the defensive alliance's eastern flank.\n\nThe BBC has approached the foreign ministries of both countries for comment.\n\nIf Putin wants to play it even more safely, he could fly via Turkey, around the south coast of Greece and then up through Montenegrin airspace before going over Serbia. But it is a far longer route.\n\nBudapest is not then the easiest of venues, even if it works very well for Viktor Orban, who has long had good relations with both Putin and Donald Trump.\n\n\"It's a leader that we like,\" said Trump on Friday, \"he likes him, I like him.\"\n\nA high-profile international summit will do Orban no harm at all, as he is trailing in the polls before elections next spring.\n\nWithin hours of Budapest being named as a venue, Orban was on the phone to Putin and declared on his Facebook page: \"Preparations are in full swing!\"\n\nOrban has little time for the EU's backing of Ukraine and he was quick to make clear Brussels would have nothing to do with the talks.\n\n\"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he told Hungarian radio on Friday.\n\nEuropean leaders will have other ideas when they see him at next week's summit in Brussels next week."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33pvlez6yjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:01:16.137+00:00","title":"How an old suitcase revealed a hidden family fortune, lost under Nazi rule","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article recounts how Antony Easton discovered a hidden suitcase in his father’s flat in 2009, containing documents, photos, and a birth certificate that revealed his father, Peter, was born Peter Hans Rudolf Eisner — a member of a wealthy Jewish family in pre-war Germany.

As Antony started to engage with the messy business of probate, he came across a small brown leather case in his father's old flat in the Hampshire town of Lymington.\n\nInside were immaculate German bank notes, photo albums, envelopes full of notes recording different chapters of his life - and a birth certificate.\n\nPeter Roderick Easton, who had prided himself on his \"Englishness\" (and been an Anglican) had, in fact, been born and raised in pre-war Germany as Peter Hans Rudolf Eisner, a member of one of the wealthiest Jewish families in Berlin.\n\nDespite hints about his father's origins growing up, the contents of the suitcase shone a light into a past that Antony knew almost nothing about. The revelations would lead him on a decade-long trail, revealing a family devastated by the Holocaust, a vanished fortune worth billions of pounds and a legacy of artwork and property stolen under Nazi rule.\n\nBlack-and-white photographs gave a glimpse of Peter's early life, far removed from his son's modest upbringing in London - they showed a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, mansions staffed by servants, staircases ornately carved with angels.\n\nMore ominously, one picture showed 12-year-old Peter Eisner smiling with friends, a Nazi flag rippling in the distance.\n\n\"I felt it was a hand reaching out from the past,\" says Antony.\n\nHe says his father was a quiet and serious man, if prone to bouts of anger. He avoided talking about his childhood and always shut down questions about his slight German accent.\n\n\"There were clues that [he wasn't] really like other people… There was a darkness around his world,\" says Antony.\n\nThe next big clue about Antony's family history came from a work of art.\n\nEnlisting the help of a friend who spoke fluent German, he asked her to dig into a company called Hahn'sche Werke, references to which were peppered among the documents in the suitcase. After searching online, she sent Antony a photo of a painting, depicting the inside of a large steelworks - seemingly owned by the business\n\nMolten metal glows hot on a conveyor belt, illuminating the faces of busy and attentive workers. It is an image of industrial power and might, from an era when Germany was hurtling towards decades of devastating war.\n\nThe 1910 painting, by the artist Hans Baluschek, was called Eisenwalzwerk (Iron Rolling Mill). It had been owned, and was likely commissioned by Heinrich Eisner, who had helped build the Hahn'sche Werke steel business into one of the most high-tech and sprawling companies in central Europe. The documents in the suitcase showed that this was Antony's great-grandfather.\n\nMore research revealed that, at the turn of the 20th Century, Heinrich was one of the wealthiest businessmen in Germany - the equivalent of a modern multi-billionaire.\n\nHis company manufactured tubular steel, with factories spread across Germany, Poland and Russia.\n\nHeinrich, and his wife, Olga, owned several properties in and around Berlin, including an impressive six-storey property in the city centre with marble floors and a cream-white facade.\n\nA photograph from the early 1900s shows a man with a softly rounded belly and a straight white moustache. Heinrich wears a black suit, and Olga sits next to him, crowned with a crystal tiara.\n\nWhen he died in 1918, Heinrich left shares in his company - and his personal fortune - to his son Rudolf, recently returned from fighting in World War One.\n\nThe war had been a human catastrophe, but Hahn'sche Werke had prospered in that period, satisfying the German military's demand for steel. Rudolf and his family also successfully weathered the economic and political chaos which haunted their country after the fighting.\n\nHowever, in a few years, all would be lost.\n\nIn notes found by Antony in the suitcase, Peter recalled overhearing conversations between his parents, and whispers about Nazi threats. Jews were being blamed by Adolf Hitler and his supporters for Germany's defeat in WW1, and for the economic travails that followed.\n\nRudolf Eisner believed he would be safe if he made his company invaluable to the Nazi regime. For a time, this seemed to work, but as anti-Jewish laws became more and more extreme, and the abuse they witnessed around them worsened, he began to reconsider.\n\nIn March 1938, the government came after Hahn'sche Werke. Under immense pressure from the authorities, the Jewish-owned company was sold at a fire-sale price to Mannesmann, an industrial conglomerate whose CEO, Wilhelm Zangen, was a Nazi supporter.\n\n\"It is almost impossible to quantify the wealth stolen and how much those assets are worth today,\" says David de Jong, author of the book Nazi Billionaires, which retraces the looting of Jewish businesses under the Third Reich.\n\nIn 2000, Mannesmann was taken over by Vodafone in a deal worth more than £100bn - the largest commercial acquisition on record at the time. At least a portion of the industrial assets included in that sale would have once been part of the Eisner business empire.\n\nThe dismantling of Hahn'sche Werke, and the arrest of members of the company, made the Eisners realise they needed to flee. But by 1937, any Jew who tried to leave Germany was forced to surrender 92% of anything they owned to the state - paying a host of levies known as the Reichsfluchtsteuer or Reich Flight Tax.\n\nThe Eisners faced losing what remained of their wealth.\n\nAt the height of this crisis, a man named Martin Hartig, an economist and tax adviser according to records in Berlin's archives, began to loom large in the Eisners' lives.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, his name had featured repeatedly in the guest book at the Eisner country estate, thanking them for their generous hospitality.\n\nHerr Hartig, who wasn't Jewish, appears to have offered the family a solution to the impending confiscation of their assets by the Nazis. They signed over key elements of their personal fortune to him - chiefly the multiple properties they owned and their contents - thereby sheltering them from laws targeting Jews.\n\nAntony believes his grandparents assumed Hartig would one day give the assets back to them.\n\nThey were wrong. Instead, he permanently transferred the Eisner assets into his own name.\n\nThe BBC found copies of the original sales documents in Germany's federal archives and shared them with three independent experts. All three concluded that this deal was evidence of a \"forced sale\" - a term widely used to describe the dispossession of Jewish assets under the Nazis.\n\nDespite losing the fortune they had built over generations, Antony's grandparents and father managed to escape Germany in 1938. Train tickets, luggage tags and hotel brochures preserved in Peter's suitcase allowed Antony to retrace their journey.\n\nThe family went to Czechoslovakia and then Poland, barely staying one step ahead of the Nazis, before catching one of the last ships bound for England in July 1939.\n\nThey had lost the equivalent of billions, but they were among the luckier members of the Eisner family. Most of their relatives were rounded up and killed in concentration camps. Rudolf himself died in 1945 after having spent most of the war - like many other German refugees - interned by the British on the Isle of Man.\n\nThe next step for Antony was to find out what had happened to the Eisner family fortune, and to Martin Hartig.\n\nHe hired an experienced investigator, Yana Slavova, to find out what exactly had been stolen, how it had changed hands, and where it was today.\n\nWithin weeks, Yana had uncovered troves of documents about his relatives, including details of their properties and possessions.\n\nShe was able to trace the painting Antony had discovered at the beginning of his journey. Eisenwalzwerk was in the collection of the Brohan Museum in Berlin.\n\nEarly attempts to reclaim the artwork ran into problems regarding the evidence. Could Antony prove that its sale was tied to Nazi persecution? How did he know it hadn't changed hands multiple times legitimately before ending up in the museum?\n\nA breakthrough came when Yana unearthed correspondence between the museum and an art dealer at the time of the sale.\n\nThe art dealer had sold the painting from one of the Eisners' former family homes - a property taken over by Martin Hartig in 1938. Hartig had lived the rest of his life there, meticulously restoring the building after damage during the fall of Berlin, before dying of natural causes in 1965.\n\nAfter Hartig's death, the property passed to his daughter, who was now in her 80s. She had gifted the house to her own children in 2014, and had moved to a country cottage, where she arranged to meet Antony and Yana.\n\nThe elderly lady made them tea and cakes, which they ate in the living room under a portrait of her father - a man with thick-rimmed glasses and oiled hair, gaunt in the face and wearing a black suit. It had been painted in 1945, just after the end of World War Two.\n\nMartin Hartig's daughter had a very different story to the one Antony and Yana were expecting.\n\nShe told them her father had always been opposed to the Nazis and had helped save the Eisners, who she described as great friends, from the Holocaust. She said he helped convince them to get away, urging the family: \"You can't stay here. Go to Great Britain, to London.\"\n\nHer father had also told her he helped them smuggle paintings out of Germany by taking them out of their frames and hiding them among clothes.\n\nWhen asked about the properties her family took over from the Eisners in 1938, she said they were all legitimate purchases.\n\n\"My father bought two houses, legally,\" she said. \"It always had to be very correct.\"\n\nOther members of the family were more open to the possibility that their ancestor may have exploited the Eisners.\n\nVincent, Martin Hartig's great-grandson, is in his 20s and training to be a carpenter.\n\nHe admitted to feeling that his home, where Antony's grandparents once lived, may have had an uncomfortable past.\n\n\"I mean of course I was curious at some point - where does it come from that we as a family live in this nice place,\" he said. \"I've also asked myself the question, how were the circumstances?\"\n\nAfter discovering what happened to Antony's Jewish family, Vincent said he thought the Eisners had little choice when they passed their property to his great-grandfather.\n\nAntony has no recourse for filing a restitution case for his grandparents' property.\n\nHis grandmother, Hildegard - Rudolf's widow - tried to reclaim it in the 1950s, but backed down after a legal challenge by Hartig. The statute of limitations for Jewish victims of Nazi persecution to claim properties in former West Germany has also now passed.\n\nFor the artworks taken from the Eisner family, however, there is still hope for recovering what was lost.\n\nEarlier this year, the Brohan Museum in Berlin informed Antony that it intended to return the Eisenwalzwerk painting to the descendants of Henrich Eisner. The museum declined an interview with the BBC while the process remains ongoing.\n\nAnother painting has been returned to Antony from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and a third claim for an artwork in Austria also remains outstanding.\n\nAmong the evidence Antony's investigation has unearthed is a list made by the Gestapo, detailing specific artefacts and paintings which were seized from his relatives. There is a chance his family could find and reclaim more assets in the future.\n\n\"I've always said about restitution, it's not about objects and money and property, it's about people,\" says Antony. In researching his family's past, he has recovered detailed knowledge of who his father and his grandparents once were.\n\n\"All of this process has turned them into real people, who had real lives.\"\n\nThis knowledge has now been passed on to a new generation. The Eisner name may have disappeared when Peter sailed to Britain in 1939, but it now lives again. Antony's great-nephew, Caspian, born in August 2024, was given the middle name of Eisner.\n\nAntony says he was deeply moved by his niece's decision to honour their long-lost family.\n\n\"You know, as long as Caspian's around, that name will still be around with him,\" he says. \"People will say, 'that's an interesting middle name - what's the story there?'\"\n\nListen to  The House At Number 48  on BBC Sounds"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43l19qn3ko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"23:45:08.748+00:00","title":"South Africa's Operation Dudula: The anti-migrant movement blocking foreigners from healthcare","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Operation Dudula, an anti-migrant activist group and political party in South Africa, has intensified its campaign to block foreigners from accessing public healthcare facilities, particularly in the Diepsloot township near Johannesburg.

anti-migrant movement blocking foreigners from healthcare\n\nA community clinic just north of Johannesburg has become the frontline of a battle in South Africa over whether foreigners can access public health facilities.\n\nWhat started as a small local action in one area in 2022 has spread, with activists from the avowedly anti-migrant group, Operation Dudula, picketing some hospitals and clinics in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. They check identity cards and stop anyone who is not South African from entering.\n\n\"Dudula\" means to remove something by force in the Zulu language.\n\nDespite some arrests, the authorities seem unable to prevent the pickets.\n\nThe site of their latest campaign is in Diepsloot – a poor township of more than 200,000 people near the country's commercial hub.\n\nOn a cool, spring Thursday morning, Sicelokuhle Moyo, dressed in a blue-and-beige skirt, thick windbreaker and a black headwrap, set out early for the clinic.\n\nThe Zimbabwean, who has lived in South Africa since 2006, was going there, as she often did, to collect her medication for a chronic condition.\n\nBut this time, when she reached the gate, things were different.\n\nTwo men wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Operation Dudula – Mass Deportation\" were stationed at the entrance. They demanded that everyone produce their documents before being allowed inside.\n\n\"I said that I had a passport. They said, they don't take passports. They want IDs only,\" Ms Moyo said, hiding her frustration behind a polite smile.\n\nDespite this being a potential flashpoint, there was a strange calmness and resignation as people knew that Operation Dudula activists had been violent in the past.\n\nAnyone unable to produce a South African ID book was turned away.\n\nSlowly walking from the entrance, Ms Moyo joined a group of women by the roadside, young children tied to their backs, waiting with uncertainty for what would happen next.\n\nTendai Musvava, a woman in her 40s, faced the same fate.\n\n\"I was standing in the queue and then they said, they [only] need some people with IDs. Me, I don't have an ID. I have a passport, I am from Mozambique. So, I can't get my medication because I don't have an ID,\" she said.\n\nMs Musvava, dressed in a bright orange winter jumper and a white hat, appeared despondent.\n\n\"I just feel like they do what they want because it's their country. I don't have a say. For now I have to follow whatever they say. I don't have a choice.\"\n\nSouth Africa is home to about 2.4 million migrants, just less than 4% of the population, according to official figures. Most come from neighbouring countries such as Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, which have a history of providing migrant labour to their wealthy neighbour.\n\nXenophobia has long been an issue in South Africa which has been accompanied by occasional outbursts of deadly violence, and anti-migrant sentiment has become a key political talking-point.\n\nHaving started as a campaign, Operation Dudula, which has, at times, been accused of using force to make its point, is now a political party with ambitions to contest next year's local government elections.\n\nParty leader Zandile Dabula insists that what her organisation is doing at public clinics in Johannesburg and other parts of the country is justified.\n\n\"We want prioritisation of South Africans. Emergency care - we understand that you must be treated - but if you are illegal you must be handed over to the law enforcers,\" she told the BBC.\n\nWhen challenged with the fact that many migrants are in the country legally, she pivots to the argument that South Africans need to be prioritised because there are minimal resources.\n\n\"Life comes first, we don't deny that, but it cannot be a freebie for everyone. We cannot cater for the whole globe. We don't have enough.\"\n\nThe constitution guarantees the right to access healthcare for everyone in the country, regardless of nationality or immigration status.\n\nBut Ms Dabula says the public health system, which caters for almost 85% of the population, is overburdened.\n\nShe says that some people have to wake up at 04:00 to join long queues at their local clinic because they know that if they don't get there on time, there will be no medication left.\n\nSouth Africa is a profoundly unequal society, with much of the country's wealth held in only a few hands. Unemployment and poverty levels are high and migrants, who often live in poor communities, are blamed by some for the problems people find themselves in.\n\nOperation Dudula's methods have found a sympathetic hearing among some Diepsloot residents.\n\nOne of them, South African Sipho Mohale, described Operation Dudula's campaign as \"a positive change\".\n\n\"The previous time when I was here, the queue was very long. But this time around, it only took me a couple of minutes to get my stuff and get out,\" he said.\n\nAnother resident, Jennifer Shingange, also welcomed the activists' presence in Diepsloot.\n\n\"As South Africans, we would come to the clinic, only to find that the medication we need is not available. But since foreign nationals stopped using the clinic, there has been a difference,\" she said.\n\nIronically, some South Africans have not been spared from the anti-migrant campaign.\n\nThey too have been turned away from public health facilities because they could not produce an ID book – more than 10% of South Africans are thought not to have proper documents proving their nationality.\n\nBut it is the flouting of the constitution in Operation Dudula's actions that angers activists on the other side of the argument.\n\n\"To have a group that is not sanctioned by the state to make decisions about who gets in and who gets out is deeply problematic,\" said Fatima Hassan, a human rights lawyer from the organisation Health Justice Initiative.\n\n\"Unless government gets a handle on this situation quite soon, it's going to lose the ability to do law and order itself.\"\n\nDeputy Health Minister Joe Phaahla told the BBC that his government was against the targeting of foreign nationals or anyone else trying to use local clinics and hospitals.\n\n\"We don't agree with that approach because health is a human right. As much as we understand the fact that the provision of services must be properly organised, you don't organise it through bullying kind of methods,\" he told the BBC.\n\nSeveral major political parties, including the Economic Freedom Fighters and the Democratic Alliance, have also condemned Operation Dudula.\n\nBut a recent attempt to take it to court by the South African Human Rights Commission failed on a technicality, effectively allowing the group to continue its campaign.\n\nSeveral Operation Dudula members have been arrested in recent weeks for blocking the entrances of public health facilities. They were later released with a  warning. The police's action, however, does not appear to have deterred the group.\n\nMs Hassan believes that stronger action is required saying that \"the police and the military should have been there on day one to prevent [the picketing] because that is simply lawlessness\".\n\nDr Phaahla said this measure was being explored but the police have said resources are \"stretched in terms of being able to monitor and intervene timeously when such incidents occur\".\n\nWhile the state hesitates over what to do, Operation Dudula appears emboldened and is turning its attention to public schools, saying that it is part of a campaign to fight illegal immigration.\n\nBut in Diepsloot, the group's action leaves people without the medical help they need.\n\nMs Musvava, who was turned away, is now looking for alternatives. Despite her meagre resources, she is considering going to the private sector.\n\n\"I think I'll have to go to the doctor. I will pay the money. I will have to sacrifice to get it,\" she said.\n\nShe had no idea how much it would cost her.\n\n\"I don't have money, but I will have to make a plan.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xgyp1zv4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:36.563+00:00","title":"No Kings protests across US cause states to activate National Guard","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, a nationwide 'No Kings' protest movement opposed to Donald Trump's policies and leadership style led to Republican governors in Texas and Virginia activating their state National Guard units.

the jewellery market in Indian capital Delhi's vibrant Lajpat Nagar neighbourhood is teeming with crowds.\n\nShops have stayed open even on holidays, and at dusk, dozens of cars line up the streets as a string of flashy signboards beckon shoppers into the flower-adorned stores.\n\nSoaring gold prices - which have topped $1,440 (£1,081) for 10g - may have slightly dented demand for jewellery in the world's second largest market for the yellow metal this year, but Indians are not willing to entirely give up on their penchant for gold yet.\n\nDiwali, along with Dhanteras -  a smaller festival that falls on Saturday this year - are believed to be auspicious occasions to buy precious metal, with hundreds of thousands of Indians flocking the markets to buy gold and silver coins, bars and jewellery, which they believe bring wealth and luck.\n\nSkyrocketing prices have created FOMO - or the fear of missing out - in the minds of buyers, who are worried prices might rise even further, Prakash Pahlajani, who runs Kumar Jewels, a family-owned business, told the BBC on a busy evening at his shop.\n\n\"As a result, I have more customers this year,\" Mr Pahlajani said.\n\nBut with prices - gold is up 60% and silver 70% - shooting through the roof, jewellers are having to change tack to counter stagnant customer budgets.\n\n\"People are not saying 'I don't want to buy'. Instead, they are saying, 'I'll buy a little less,\" said Tanishq Gupta, another jeweller down the road from Mr Pahlajani's shop.\n\nHe said he's had to be innovative and design pieces that look elaborate but have a reduced quantity of gold in them. A coin made of 250mg gold, which he sells for as low as $35, is now thinner but made to look as big as the heavier ones.\n\nCoins weighing a tenth of that, at 25mg, are also on offer in the market.\n\nPushpinder Chauhan, another retailer in the area, said higher prices had also exacerbated the growing preference for lighter jewellery this year, \"especially among younger buyers\" who want pieces for everyday wear and not just special occasions.\n\nSeveral jewellers the BBC spoke to pointed to another clear trend - more customers were buying gold and silver for investment rather than jewellery this year, something that is also reflected in bullion market data.\n\nWhile gold jewellery continues to account for the largest share of India's overall gold demand, the proportion driven by investment - primarily bars and coins - has been rising steadily, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).\n\n\"Jewellery's share declined to 64% in the second quarter of this year, from 80% in the same period in 2023, while investment demand increased from 19% to 35% over the same period,\" Kavita Chacko, the council's research head, told the BBC.\n\nA lot of that demand is also being fed by investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or digital gold, where September marked record high inflows.\n\nETF assets under management have surged by over 70% this year.\n\nBesides retail demand, gold prices are also being significantly influenced by India's central bank, with the metal's share in its foreign exchange reserves rising from 9% to 14% in 2025, according to WGC.\n\nIn fact, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been \"a major pillar of global gold demand over the past three years\", said Kaynat Chainwala who tracks commodities at Kotak Securities, a broking house.\n\nShe said the RBI has been stocking up on gold in a bid to diversify its foreign exchange holdings, reduce its dependence on the dollar and provide stability during geopolitical stress.\n\nGoing forward, with the festive and the wedding season under way, retail demand for gold and silver is expected to continue to hold up despite record-high prices, say experts.\n\n\"The affluent classes will continue to buy, though it is a setback for lower income families,\" said Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at the state-run Bank of Baroda. \"Demand will hold up in value terms, even though volumes will fall.\"\n\nBut some families have been totally priced out of the market.\n\n\"I am now having to think a lot while buying - about whether to even get something,\" Bhavna, who's getting married in February, told the BBC outside Mr Pahlajani's jewellery store.\n\nFor the moment, she's held off her purchases and is waiting for prices to fall a bit so that she can come back to finish her wedding shopping.\n\nSuch strong cultural affinity for physical gold, particularly jewellery, means the appetite for the noble metal is unlikely to be dented in the long term, despite the short-term moderation, say experts.\n\nThis is especially true for a country where high gold holdings have given solid long-term returns, making many Indians affluent at a time when growth is stumbling and jobs are hard to come by.\n\nAccording to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held a staggering $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's GDP.\n\n\"This implies a positive wealth effect on the household balance sheet, given the uptrend in gold prices,\" Economists Upasana Chachra and Bani Gambhir wrote in a recent note, adding that Indian families are also benefitting from \"cyclical factors of lower interest payments with monetary policy easing, and the positive impact on disposable income through direct and indirect tax cuts\".\n\nThat's not a bad start to the festive season, even though record prices may have taken some glitter off the precious metal.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykvq2955qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"21:45:04.096+00:00","title":"Lamborghini swerves away from all-electric future","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lamborghini, under CEO Stephan Winkelmann, is choosing to delay its full transition to electric vehicles, citing strong customer demand for the sound and emotion of internal combustion engines.

all-electric future\n\nThe boss of Lamborghini has said its customers still want \"the sound and the emotion\" of internal combustion engines, and the company will use them in its cars for at least the next decade.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC at the Italian supercar-maker's London showroom, chief executive Stephan Winkelmann said enthusiasm for electric cars was declining - creating an opportunity to focus on hybrid power instead.\n\nLamborghini will decide in the next month whether a long-planned new model, the Lanzador, will be all-electric, or merely a plug-in hybrid, he said.\n\nMr Winkelmann insisted the business was socially responsible, but added that as a low-volume manufacturer, its actions would have a limited impact on the environment.\n\nLamborghini is a luxury brand ultimately owned by the Volkswagen Group. It currently has three main models.\n\nThe Temerario and Revuelto are supercars. Both are plug-in hybrids, combining powerful petrol engines with electric motors. They can run in all-electric mode, but only for very short distances.\n\nThe Urus is a luxury SUV, currently available as a plug-in hybrid and as a conventional petrol-powered car. Less exotic and certainly less ostentatious than the supercars, it nevertheless makes up more than half of the company's sales.\n\nThere is also a limited edition \"super-sports\" car - the Fenomeno, which has a top speed of more than 215mph. Only 30 will be built, each costing at least €3m (£2.6m) before taxes.\n\nTwo years ago, Lamborghini announced plans for an all-electric successor to the Urus, which would have been available from 2029. However, the plan was recently shelved, with the electric model now not expected before 2035.\n\nIt had also planned to make a brand new battery-powered grand tourer (GT), to be called the Lanzador. However, the future of that project is also deeply uncertain.\n\n\"We still need to decide whether we are going full electric, the decision we took some years ago, or seeing whether in the new environment this should also be a plug-in hybrid,\" said Mr Winkelmann.\n\nThe new environment he refers to is a perceived waning of interest in electric cars among high-end buyers.\n\n\"Today enthusiasm for electric cars is going down,\" he explained. \"We see a huge opportunity to stay with internal combustion engines and a battery system much longer than expected.\"\n\nContinuing to use internal combustion engines for another 10 years, he said, would be \"paramount for the success of the company\". Customers, he insisted, still hankered after the noise and fury of a conventional motor.\n\n\"This is something they want, they still want the sound and the emotion of an internal combustion engine,\" he said.\n\nIt's an approach that contrasts with that of Lamborghini's Italian arch-rival Ferrari, which is pushing ahead with its own plans for a first all-electric car.\n\nThe aptly-named Elettrica is due to be unveiled next year, though the company showed off some key components at its Capital Markets Day earlier this month.\n\nIt will be sold alongside conventional and hybrid models.\n\nFerrari chief executive Benedetto Vigna said it would have driving traits that were \"unique in the heart, in the soul of our clients\".\n\nMr Winkelmann insisted his own company was not ignoring the ongoing pressure to cut emissions.\n\n\"We are selling 10,000 cars in a world that is producing 80 million cars a year, so our impact in terms of CO2 emissions is not that important,\" he said.\n\n\"For sure, we are socially responsible, but it doesn't really make a lot of difference.\"\n\nThe sale of new petrol and diesel cars, including plug-in hybrids, is due to be banned in both the EU and the UK from 2035.\n\nHowever, in the EU, there has been intense lobbying from some manufacturers for the transition to electric cars to be given more time, in order to \"acknowledge current industrial and geopolitical realities\".\n\nIf that happens, internal combustion engines could remain on the market beyond the current deadline.\n\nMeanwhile the UK's rules provide an exemption for \"low volume\" manufacturers who register fewer than 2,500 new cars each year.\n\nThis would currently cover Lamborghini, which sold just 795 cars here last year."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205g21n1zzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:13:48.617+00:00","title":"Galleri test: Exciting results from blood test for 50 cancers","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new blood test developed by Grail, known as the Galleri test, has shown promising results in detecting over 50 types of cancer, including those with no current screening programs such as ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancers.

Exciting results from blood test for 50 cancers \n\nA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.\n\nResults of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.\n\nMore than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.\n\nThe Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.\n\nThe trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.\n\nLead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening.\n\nHe explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".\n\nThe test   correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.\n\nWhen combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.\n\nCrucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.\n\nThese impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.\n\nBut scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.\n\nClare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"\n\nThe topline results are to be released at the  European Society for Medical Oncology  congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMuch will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.\n\nThe NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.\n\nSir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"\n\nMany cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".\n\nBut Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\".\n\n\"The UK   National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq502xl53xqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"21:35:37.444+00:00","title":"How nervous are investors about the stock market?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Investor anxiety about US stock markets in early 2025 stems from a mix of financial sector instability—such as the bankruptcies of car parts supplier First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor—and concerns over overvalued stock prices, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector.

swooned over signs of rekindled US-China tensions, as the two superpowers face off over tariffs, advanced technology and access to rare earths.\n\nThe bankruptcies of car parts supplier First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor acted as a trigger for nervous chatter in September.\n\nOver the last month, US shares, which had been climbing since their tariff-induced rout in April, have flattened.\n\nBut in many ways the market swings so far - down roughly 3% at the steepest - are not unusual.\n\nZooming out, the major indexes have still posted gains since the start of the year, with the S&P 500 up roughly 13%. That's smaller than 2024 but still solid.\n\n\"The market has done surprisingly well so far this year ... driven by an improvement in corporate profits and the enthusiasm surrounding AI,\" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\nThe resilience of the stock market is, ironically, exactly what is driving some of the jitters.\n\nPut simply, when set against other standard metrics like profits, share prices in the US are very high.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns about a possible bubble emerging in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry have generated a steady undercurrent of talk since the start of the year - discussions that have ramped up as analysts struggle to see how the vast sums of money the biggest players are throwing at one another all fit together.\n\nThe Bank of England warned recently of \"stretched valuations\" and rising risk of a \"sharp market correction\".\n\nThose  concerns were echoed  in remarks from JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon and to some extent US central bank chair Jerome Powell.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund was the latest to chime in this week.\n\n\"Markets appear complacent as the ground shifts,\" it said in its financial stability report, which noted risks from trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty and rising sovereign indebtedness.\n\nJames Reilley, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said the market falls triggered by the regional banks were a sign of investors alert to risk and moving quickly to reduce exposure amid uncertainty about whether the losses were indicative of wider issues.\n\nBut he said the brief nature of the drops showed how quickly such worries could clear.\n\nMany investors remain optimistic, with analysts at firms such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in recent weeks boosting their forecasts for where the S&P 500 might climb by the end of the year.\n\nDavid Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said he thought a sharp sell-off was unlikely at a time when growth in the US remains solid and the US central bank is lowering borrowing costs.\n\nHe is expecting the S&P 500 to end the year hovering around 6,900 points, about 4% higher than where it sits on Friday.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the troubles popping up at banks, he noted that the lenders involved have alleged fraud.\n\nHe said the overall picture, when looking at default levels, appears healthy, and he saw little risk that demand for AI would suddenly decline, puncturing valuations.\n\n\"I'm not saying we're in a bubble. I'm not saying we're not in a bubble. The question is what's going to drive the downside,\" he said. \"Things don't usually spontaneously decline.\"\n\nA typical bull market - when shares are rising - lasts about four and a half years, said Mr Stovall.\n\nWith inflation still sticky, and investors wary of events in Washington, like the government shutdown and Trump administration's efforts to influence the US central bank, this year's market rally has been \"unloved\", said Mr Stovall.\n\nOn the other hand, he noted: \"It's just a matter of time.

He was released on Friday night, US media report.\n\n\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.\n\nIn April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"\n\nHe reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"\n\nProsecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.\n\nIn his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service.\n\n\"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old.\n\n\"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month.\n\nSantos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\n\nFrom there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions.\n\n\"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"\n\nSantos began serving his sentence in July.\n\nTrump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.\n\nIn May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.\n\nHe also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.\n\nCommutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7em5p087vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:18:31.728+00:00","title":"Anger as historic Clyde ship towed out to sea and sunk in Hawaii","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A historic Clydebuilt sailing ship, Falls of Clyde, built in 1878 and moored in Honolulu since the 1960s, was deliberately sunk in 2025 after being towed 25 miles offshore.

as historic Clyde ship towed out to sea and sunk in Hawaii\n\nA historic Clydebuilt sailing ship has been towed out to sea off the coast of Hawaii and deliberately sunk, prompting outrage from maritime conservation groups.\n\nFalls of Clyde, built in 1878, had been moored as a museum ship in Honolulu since the 1960s but had fallen into a poor state of repair.\n\nThe  Honolulu Harbour Board confirmed  it had the ship towed into deep water about 25 miles offshore on Wednesday and then scuttled.\n\nThe news has been met with anger and dismay by campaigners who have spent more than a decade trying to bring the ship back to its birthplace to rebuild it.\n\nFalls of Clyde was the first in a series of eight iron-hulled ships built in the late 19th Century by the Port Glasgow shipbuilder Russell & Co.\n\nThe ship spent many years carrying various cargoes to and from the Far East and Australasia before moving to Hawaii.\n\nIn the early 20th Century it had steel tanks fitted and was converted into a tanker to carry paraffin to the islands, where it later became a floating fuel depot before being acquired by a museum in Honolulu.\n\nBut the ship was badly damaged by a hurricane in the 1980s, the maritime section of the museum closed down and for years it has been left slowly decaying.\n\nEnthusiasts in Scotland have spent a decade trying to bring the ship home for restoration, but were unable to reach an agreement with the harbour board which wants to redevelop the quay where it was moored.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Transportation said the operation to remove the ship began at dawn on Wednesday and it was sunk about 25 miles south of the harbour.\n\nIt said the vessel's name, wheel and bell were retained along with other artifacts which will be put on display.\n\nThe destruction of the historic ship has been widely criticised by maritime conservation groups both in the UK and the USA.\n\nFriends of Falls of Clyde, a group of supporters in Hawaii, described it as  \"a day that will go down in infamy\".\n\n\"It is almost inconceivable that this situation has been allowed to happen,\" the group posted on social media.\n\nThe group organised a farewell ceremony with bagpipers on Tuesday after learning that the ship was to be sunk the following morning.\n\nThe Tall Ship Glenlee, the charity that looks after another Clydebuilt sailing vessel moored beside Glasgow's Riverside Museum, said it was \"deeply saddened\".\n\nDavid O'Neill, from the Scotland based  Save Falls of Clyde campaign , said he was \"horrified\" at the behaviour of the authorities in Hawaii but had become resigned to the ship meeting such a fate after years of fruitless negotiation.\n\nHe first became involved in efforts to rescue the ship in 2015 when someone in Hawaii alerted him to its condition, prompting him to post an appeal on social media saying: \"Old Scottish lady needs a lift home.\"\n\nA Norwegian firm which operates heavy lift ships offered to transport Falls of Clyde back to Scotland for free, but the campaign was soon embroiled in a wrangle with the harbour board over insurance costs and other conditions.\n\nEarlier this year Mr O'Neill said an American firm won a contract to remove the ship from the  harbour and it also offered to transport it to Scotland for free.\n\n\"They didn't want to sink the ship - they had a conscience and a respect for maritime heritage,\" he said.\n\nBut the deal between the firm and the harbour board fell through, and the contract went instead to another company which then carried out the scuttling.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Transportation has been contacted for comment.\n\nMr O'Neill said he had seen a video showing the final moments of Falls of Clyde.\n\n\"She was towed out of harbour looking really elegant and stunning for a 147-year-old ship, unaided, not needing any pumps,\" he said.\n\n\"She was still afloat and for us that's representative that she was truly Clydebuilt.\"\n\nHe said he found watching the ship go down \"quite disturbing\".\n\n\"She goes down by the stern and most of the ship lifts out of the water, like in the Titanic movie.\"\n\nThe businessman is now concentrating his efforts on trying to bring home a Clydebuilt ship from a different era - the Type 21 frigate HMS Ambuscade.\n\nThe warship was built for the Royal Navy at the Yarrow shipyard in Glasgow in the 1970s, and saw action in the Falklands War.\n\nIt later sold to the Pakistan Navy where it served until it was decommissioned two years ago.\n\nMr O'Neill said he secured the frigate for free  after making a \"cheeky request\"  to the Pakistani government, and he is working on plans to return it to the Clyde to become a museum ship."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy534vw28go","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"23:10:31.939+00:00","title":"Weapons smuggler jailed for 40 years after

weapons smuggler who used a fishing boat to ship ballistic missile parts from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen has been sentenced to 40 years in a US prison.\n\nPakistani national Muhammad Pahlawan was detained during a US military operation in the Arabian Sea in January 2024 - during which two US Navy Seals drowned.\n\nPahlawan's crew testified they had been duped into taking part, having believed they were working as fishermen.\n\nThe Houthis had launched sustained missile and drone attacks on Israel at the time, and targeted international commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, saying they were acting in support of Gazans. Iran has consistently denied arming the Houthis.\n\nThe crew's detailed testimonies to a court in the US state of Virginia provide a rare look inside a smuggling operation that helped power the attacks.\n\nThe components found on Pahlawan's boat were \"some of the most sophisticated weapon systems that Iran proliferates to other terrorist groups\", US federal prosecutors said after his trial.\n\nThe 49-year-old was sentenced on Thursday, having been previously convicted on five counts - including terrorism offences and transporting weapons of mass destruction.\n\nCourt documents show the sentences for two of the five counts will run concurrently for 240 months, or 20 years. The other three counts, another 20 years, will run consecutive to that - making a total of 480 months, or 40 years.\n\nThe eight crew members who testified in court said they had no idea what was inside the large packages on board the boat, named the Yunus.\n\nOne crew member said that when he questioned Pahlawan about it, he was told to mind his own business.\n\nPahlawan, however, knew just how dangerous the cargo was.\n\nHe referred to himself as a \"walking dead person\" in text message exchanges with his wife, sent in the days before the January 2024 voyage which would get him arrested.\n\n\"Just pray that [we] come back safely,\" said the message, used as evidence in court.\n\n\"Why do you talk like this, 'may or may not come back',\" she asked him.\n\nPahlawan told her: \"Such is the nature of the job, my dear, such is the nature of the job.\"\n\nHis final words to her before sailing were: \"Keep me in your prayers. May God take me there safely and bring me back safely, alright. Pray.\"\n\nFor this journey, Pahlawan was paid 1,400 million rials (£25,200; $33,274) - a substantial fee prosecutors at his trial described as \"danger money\".\n\nThe trip was \"part of a larger operation\" funded and co-ordinated by two Iranian brothers, Yunus and Shahab Mir'kazei, said the then-US Department of Defense (now known as the Department of War) in a statement in June.\n\nThe Mir'kazei brothers are allegedly affiliated, it added, with Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) - the most powerful armed force in Iran. The IRGC is designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US.\n\nBoth Shahab and Yunus Mir'kazei have been charged by the American authorities, but are still at large and believed to be in Iran.\n\nPahlawan made two successful smuggling voyages before he was caught - one in October 2023, and a second two months later.\n\nThe dozen men he recruited to join him were all from Pakistan and had travelled across the border into Iran looking for work.\n\nBefore setting off on the December trip, the US court heard, the crew were tasked with loading large packages on to the boat in Chabahar on Iran's south coast.\n\nThen, after five or six days at sea, when they were close to the coast of Somalia, the crew described another boat pulling up next to them at night and them having to hand over the cargo.\n\nCrew member Mehandi Hassan told the court there were about five men on the other boat, who spoke in a language he didn't recognise.\n\nTheir next voyage, the following month, was expected to follow the same route. As before, it began in the small port of Konarak before sailing to Chabahar, where the crew were made to load heavy boxes on board.\n\nThe packages, the US Navy would later discover, contained Iranian-made ballistic missile parts, anti-ship cruise missile components and a warhead.\n\nOnce at sea, Pahlawan kept to himself, according to crew testimony, often staying in his cabin and watching movies on his phone. Sometimes they would see Pahlawan on a second mobile - a satellite phone - but they didn't know what he was saying, said Mehandi Hassan, because he would speak in a language they didn't understand.\n\nOn 11 January, the crew said they were woken by the sound of helicopter rotors overhead and a US Navy ship pulling alongside. Pahlawan came out of his cabin to tell everyone to \"keep going\" and not to stop the boat, telling them the ship and helicopters belonged to pirates.\n\nArmed US Navy Seals and Coast Guard officers attempted to board the Yunus. \"There was a lot of commotion,\" one crew member, Aslam Hyder, told the court.\n\nSpecial Warfare Officer Christopher Chambers lost his grip and fell into the water during the operation - and Special Warfare Officer First Class Nathan Gage Ingram jumped in to try to save him.\n\nBoth men were so laden with equipment that they quickly drowned, an internal report later found. Their bodies were never found and they were declared dead 10 days later.\n\nThe crew remained on the Yunus for two days before being offloaded to a US Navy ship, the court heard, where they were separated into two groups and held in windowless containers.\n\nPahlawan ordered the crew to lie and to say the captain had already fled. \"He said, 'Don't tell them that I am the [captain], because I can do serious damage to you guys if you do that',\" Aslam Hyder told the court.\n\n\"He started to threaten us... It was about the family and the children, that they will not know about you and you won't know what happened to them,\" he said. \"Then we got very scared and we became quiet.\"\n\nOne by one, said crew members who gave evidence, they were taken out of the containers to be interrogated individually. Everyone on board - including Pahlawan - was asked who the captain was and, according to US prosecutors, Pahlawan \"simply evaded, lied, and hid\".\n\nThe American military said the packages found on board the Yunus were the first Iranian-supplied weapons to be seized by US forces since the Houthis had started attacking vessels in the Red Sea a few months earlier.\n\nBut Pahlawan had been following a common route for smugglers carrying weapons bound for Yemen.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2023, US forces and their allies seized almost 2.4 million pieces of ammunition, 365 anti-tank guided missiles, and more than 29,000 small arms and light weapons from small boats in the Arabian Sea, according to a UN report.\n\nTypically, smugglers use dhows - a type of small boat, often for fishing - to transport cargo close to the coast of Somalia.\n\nAs with the Yunus, it is here that weapons are transferred to other, smaller boats, which then set sail to \"secluded beaches off the southern coast of Yemen… where they are then smuggled across the desert to Houthi-controlled areas of the country\", the UN Office on Drugs and Crime report says.\n\nWilliam Freer, from the UK think tank Council on Geostrategy, told BBC News that while most of the Houthi attacks have involved smaller weapons, the components found on Pahlawan's ship are \"a lot more complicated and can pack a lot more punch\".\n\n\"Very quickly, most shipping companies decided to redirect all their vessels, where possible, around South Africa rather than transiting through the Red Sea.\"\n\nThis lengthy detour adds about 10 to 12 days of sailing time to each trip, and extra fuel, which  previous analysis  has estimated to cost companies about an extra $1m (£748,735) per round trip.\n\nMr Freer added that the impact on commercial shipping has continued to this day.\n\n\"Within about two months of the initial attacks [in October 2023], shipping transiting through the Red Sea had dropped by about 60% to 70%, and it has stayed at that level ever since, even with the ceasefires,\" he told us.\n\nEven though Houthi strikes are now less frequent, he added, there are still \"just enough attacks to convince shipping companies it is not worth running the risk of returning\" to the Red Sea route.\n\nIran has been accused by the US, UK, Israel and Saudi Arabia of smuggling missiles and other weapons to the Houthis by sea, in violation of a UN Security Council resolution since the armed group ousted Yemen's internationally-recognised government from much of north-western Yemen 10 years ago, sparking a devastating civil war. Iran denies this.\n\nOn 5 June this year, Pahlawan was found guilty of conspiring to provide material support and resources to terrorists; providing material support to the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guard Corps' weapons of mass destruction programme; conspiring to and transporting explosive devices to the Houthis, knowing these explosives would be used to cause harm; and threatening his crew.\n\n\"Pahlawan was not only a seasoned smuggler,\" prosecutors said, \"he knew what he was smuggling and its intended use.\"\n\nIn a final plea to the court for leniency, Pahlawan's lawyer wrote that life for Pahlawan's wife had long been estranged from her family because of her marriage to him, and that since his arrest, her and her child's lives had become \"extremely difficult and harsh\".\n\n\"Since the jury verdict, Mr Pahlawan's singular focus in their telephone conversations is the wellbeing of his family,\" his attorney said. \"He does not talk about himself or his fate. He cries with worry over what will become of his wife and child.\"\n\nBut the court ruled that his high sentence was \"appropriate due to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e471159vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"23:42:24.234+00:00","title":"Fentanyl: How the US is emerging from its drugs death epidemic","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article chronicles the decline in fentanyl-related deaths in the United States, particularly in North Carolina, where a 35% drop in overdose fatalities has been achieved through a combination of harm reduction strategies, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs.

up in the US state of North Carolina.\n\n\"I felt like literally amazing.  The voices in my head just completely went silent. I got instantly addicted,\" she remembers.\n\nThe little blue pills Kayla became hooked on were probably made in Mexico, and then smuggled across the border to the US - a deadly trade President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on.\n\nBut drug cartels aren't pharmacists. So, Kayla never knew how much fentanyl was in the pill she was taking. Would there be enough of the synthetic opioid to kill her?\n\n\"It's scary to think about that,\" Kayla says, reflecting on how she could have overdosed and died at any moment.\n\nIn 2023, there were over 110,000 drug-related deaths in the US. The march of fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, seemed unstoppable.\n\nBut then came a staggering turnaround.\n\nIn 2024, the number of fatal overdoses across the US fell by around 25%. That's nearly 30,000 fewer deaths – dozens of lives saved every day. Kayla's state, North Carolina, is at the forefront of that trend.\n\nOne of the explanations is a commitment to harm reduction. This means promoting policies that prioritise drug users' health and wellbeing rather than criminalising people - a recognition that in an era of fentanyl, drug-taking too often ends with death by overdose.\n\nIn North Carolina, where Kayla still lives, and where overdose fatalities are currently down by an impressive 35%, harm reduction strategies are well-developed.\n\nKayla no longer takes street drugs. And she's a client of an innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programme in Fayetteville. It's a partnership between the town's police and the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition. Together, they work to divert substance users away from crime, and get them on the road to recovery.\n\n\"If someone's stealing from a grocery store, we run their criminal history. And often we see that the crimes they're committing appear to fund the addiction they have,\" says Lt Jamaal Littlejohn.\n\nThis might make them a candidate for the LEAD programme, meaning they can get support to tackle their addiction, and can start thinking about secure housing and employment.\n\nThe proponents of LEAD say it isn't about being soft on crime. Drug dealers still go to prison in Fayetteville. \"But if we can get people the services they need, it gives law enforcement more time to deal with bigger crimes,\" argues Lt Littlejohn, who watched his own sister struggle with a substance use disorder.\n\nKayla has blossomed. She's such a long way now from the days when she used prostitution to fund her fentanyl habit. As part of the LEAD process, her criminal record has been wiped. She recently graduated as a certified nurse assistant, and is now working in a residential home.\n\n\"It's like the best thing ever. This is the longest time I've been clean,\" she says.\n\nCritical to Kayla's recovery has been treatment. She's been taking methadone for nearly a year when she tells her story to the BBC. \"It's keeping me from going back,\" she believes.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine are medications used to treat opioid use disorder.  They stem cravings and stop painful withdrawal. Nationwide, treatment has played a role in puncturing the overdose fatality statistics.\n\nIn North Carolina, it's been a game-changer: more than 30,000 people were enrolled in a programme in 2024, with numbers climbing in 2025.\n\nAt 09:00 at one of the Morse Clinics in the state capital of Raleigh, two or three people wait their turn in reception.\n\n\"The busiest time is 5.30am to 7am, so before work,\" says Dr Eric Morse, an addiction psychiatrist running nine clinics offering medication assisted treatment (MAT) in North Carolina. \"Most of our folks are working - once they're sober, they show up to work on time every day.\"\n\nThe clinic runs a finely-tuned operation. After patients check in, they're called to a dosing window to receive their prescription. They're in and out in minutes.\n\nThey'll randomly be drug tested for illicit narcotics. Dr Morse says around half his patients are still testing positive for opioids bought on the street, but he doesn't see this as failure.\n\n\"Maybe you're using once a week and you're used to using three times a day… You're still playing Russian roulette with fentanyl but you've taken a whole bunch of bullets out of the chamber, so your survival rate goes up significantly,\" says Dr Morse.\n\nThis is harm reduction.  So rather than be expelled from the treatment programme, patients who get a positive drug test are given extra support and counselling.  Dr Morse says 80-90% will eventually stop using street drugs altogether.  And in time, many will taper off their medication too.\n\nNot everyone thinks this is the right approach.\n\nMark Pless is a Republican who sits in North Carolina's state House of Representatives, and used to be a full-time paramedic. He points out that illegal drug-taking starts with a choice.\n\nAnd he doesn't believe in harm reduction. In particular he's against treating opioid use disorder with medications like methadone or buprenorphine.\n\n\"You're replacing an addictive product with another addictive product,\" he says. \"If you have to take it in order to stay clean, it's still addictive. We've got to figure out how to get people to where they can do better – we can't leave them on drugs forever.\"\n\nHe favours abstinence treatment programmes, when drug users go \"cold turkey\".\n\nBut there's pushback from health professionals in North Carolina.\n\n\"I believe there are multiple paths to recovery,\" says Dr Morse. \"I'm not pooh-poohing abstinence-based treatment - except when you look at the medical evidence.\"\n\nDr Morse references  a Yale University study from 2023  analysing the risk of death for opioid users in a treatment programme compared to people not in treatment.  The study suggested that someone in abstinence treatment was as likely - or more more likely - to have a fatal overdose as a person who wasn't in treatment and was continuing to use street opioids like fentanyl.\n\nTreatment aside, another drug is helping.\n\nNaloxone is widely available, and used as a nasal spray it reverses the effect of an opioid overdose, helping someone breathe again. In North Carolina in 2024, it was administered more than 16,000 times. That's potentially 16,000 lives saved – and these are only the overdose reversals that have been reported.\n\n\"This is as close to a miracle drug as we can ever imagine,\" says Dr Nabarun Dasgupta, a scientist specialising in street drugs at the University of North Carolina.\n\nMany users of narcotics like cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin want to know that what they're taking won't kill them. Some people use test-strips to check for fentanyl, because they know it's been implicated in so many fatal overdoses.\n\nBut the strips don't identify all potentially harmful substances. Dr Dasgupta runs a national drugs-testing laboratory. Users send him a tiny bit of their drug supply via local non-profit organisations.\n\n\"We've analysed close to 14,000 samples from 43 states over the last three years,\" he says.\n\nTesting drugs for potentially dangerous additives is an additional weapon in the harm reduction armoury. Dr Dasgupta believes another reason for decreasing overdose fatalities in the US is that young people are avoiding opioids like fentanyl.\n\n\"We see a demographic shift. Generation Z are dying of overdose much less frequently than their parents or their grandparents' generations were at the same age,\" he says.\n\nDr Dasgupta isn't entirely surprised 20-somethings are steering clear of opioids. A shocking four out of 10 American adults know someone whose life has been ended by an overdose.\n\nIt was this epidemic of death, set in train in the 1990s by prescription opioids, that motivated North Carolina's former attorney general - now the state governor - to move against powerful corporations benefitting from so many Americans' dark spiral down into addiction.\n\nJosh Stein picked up the phone to his counterparts in other states, and took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n\n\"There was a Republican attorney general in Tennessee, I'm Democrat in North Carolina… But we're all caring about our people and we're all willing to fight for them,\" Stein reflects.\n\nThe upshot, after years of intense negotiations, was an Opioid Settlement totalling some $60bn (£45bn). This is money that huge companies have agreed to pay to US states, to be used for the \"abatement of the opioid epidemic\". North Carolina's share is around $1.5bn.\n\n\"It has to be spent in four ways – drug prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. I think it's transformative,\" says Governor Stein.\n\nMeanwhile, funding from the national government is uncertain. The cuts to Medicaid included in President Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could have a tremendous impact on this area.\n\nIn the Morse Clinics in Raleigh, 70% of patients depend on Medicaid. If they lose health insurance, will they end treatment and become more vulnerable to death by overdose? Although North Carolina's drug fatality statistics look optimistic, thousands of people are still dying - and the state's black, indigenous and non-white populations haven't experienced the same rates of decrease.\n\nAnd there remain other states that have witnessed a stubbornly slower rate of decrease in lethal overdoses - including Nevada and Arizona.\n\nNo one is complacent. Least of all Kayla.\n\nIn the grip of fentanyl for three long years, she never overdosed herself, but she did have to save her friends. Kayla's parents didn't know what to do with her.\n\n\"They kind of gave up on me - they thought I was gonna be dead,\" she remembers.\n\nKayla credits Charlton Roberson, her harm reduction mentor, as being instrumental in her recovery.  Her aim now is to taper off methadone and become medication- and drug-free. She also wants to find a job in a hospital.\n\n\"I feel more alive than I ever did when I was using fentanyl,\" she says.\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via  the BBC Action Line ."}]}
