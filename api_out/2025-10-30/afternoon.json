cigarette and all \n       \n  By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There are no saints in the aftermath of a complicated breakup, and in one of the visuals accompanying Lily Allen’s latest album, “West End Girl” — interpreted as a post-mortem on her marriage to actor David Harbour — she assumes the role of the wayward nun, donning the familiar black and white habit to take a smoke break.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise album, which Allen released last Friday, can be taken as a play-by-play of the downfall of her five-year marriage, which began with Las Vegas nuptials in September 2020 after the couple met on celebrity dating app Raya. Though Allen did  tell Vogue  the album is only “inspired” by the relationship and not “all gospel.”\n \n\n   \n  Since its release, listeners have been piecing together a bigger picture of their relationship and its fallout, referencing the lyrics with years of reports and rumors. Also in the crossfire: the couple’s divisive  Architectural Digest feature  in early 2023, featuring their eclectic Brooklyn townhouse, which is now being retrospectively eyed as a warning sign. (“Perhaps The David Harbour-Lily Allen Home Is Worth Wrecking,” pop culture critic Hunter Harris  penned  as a Substack headline at the time.)\n \n\n   \n  Blessedly, the album visuals are striking not in their maximalism, but their quieter reverie. Throughout the images, Allen unsettles Catholic iconography: In one looped video, she clasps her hands in prayer, wearing the blue and red of Mother Mary; on the album’s cover, painter Nieves González  depicts  the singer as an updated Baroque icon, stoic in polka dots and chiaroscuro lighting.\n \n\n   \n  In the video loop of Allen as a nun, she crosses a leg to reveal sheer tights and black pumps as she smokes a cigarette. She seems to be grappling with the duality of desire — something she candidly sings to in the song “Sleepwalking” (“I know you’ve made me your Madonna / I wanna be your wh**e”). But the visual metaphor resonates across the album at large. Allen doesn’t depict herself as the virtuous, scorned wife, but a real and raw person who cycles through anxiety and insecurity until everything reaches its bitter end.\n \n\n   \n  Nun imagery has often been deployed in music, art and fashion to symbolize a reverence that is readily subverted, by sex, sin or feminism. Lady Gaga has worn the habit in music videos and on tour, while designers including Rick Owens have frequently played with the cloth caps’ austere form. And though Allen’s version of a nun is certainly no stranger to vice, she is perhaps most subverted by a lack of faith in herself, as she painfully recounts going against her better judgement again and again.\n \n\n   \n  “Listen, I am in a period of self-discovery at the moment and I’m really trying to explore how I’ve got myself into certain situations in the past,” she told Vogue. “I need to unpack some things and break some patterns and probably talk to my therapist about my relationship with my dad.”\n \n\n   \n  Online, some commentators have already dubbed the upcoming months “West End Girl Winter,” as Allen ushers in a period of self-reflection, leaving 2024’s “ Brat summer ” far in the rearview mirror. The key items for this new season are yet to be determined, but will presumably include a posh home, smudged eyeliner, revenge heels and an incisive pen. The full nun’s habit remains optional.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/fentanyl-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:42:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s big concession to Xi is loaded with red flags","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump made a significant concession in his trade negotiations with China by agreeing to reduce U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% in exchange for China’s promise to strengthen its crackdown on fentanyl.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump made an extraordinary concession in his  landmark deal  with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday: In exchange for promises that China will crack down on fentanyl, the United States will shave 10% off the tariffs it charges on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, it’s a promising deal that could restore some of the trade that tariffs had stymied between the world’s two largest economies. The reduction will bring the minimum tariff on Chinese imports down to 20%, and the average tariff rate will fall to around 47%. That’s lofty compared to many other US trading partners but still more in line with the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  It could give some relief to US consumers, and it means Chinese goods can shed the outcast status in the United States that Trump’s high tariffs had imposed on them.\n \n\n   \n  But the tariff reduction is also a significant gamble for the Trump administration, which has encountered a persistent problem in its unprecedented trade war with China: ﻿Trump has been  bested by Xi in the trade war  at every turn. Even the fact that they met in person Thursday means Trump has already given into China’s demands. And, as history has proven in these on-again, off-again deals, it’s not clear the United States will get anything serious back by giving in on fentanyl tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Trump risks further eroding America’s relationship with its key allies while gaining a friendlier relationship with its chief economic adversary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is betting this time will be different. History suggests otherwise.\n \n\n   \n    China’s successful fight against Trump\n \n\n   \n  Trump wanted  four main outcomes  from his  tariffs on China : A reduction in fentanyl coming into the United States, a return of manufacturing to the United States, restoration of the balance of trade and a sale of TikTok’s US assets.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has made real progress on all four: China has pointed to strong actions it has taken toward preventing the export of the foundational chemicals used to make fentanyl. Dozens of companies have promised multibillion-dollar investments in US manufacturing. The US-China trade gap hit a 21-year low in August. And Trump and Xi agreed to the framework of a TikTok deal.\n \n\n   \n  But the frosty relationship has also caused major problems for the United States. China has restricted the export of  rare-earth minerals  – crucial elements in electronics and military equipment. It has refused to buy US soybeans, devastating American farmers. And it has made life more difficult for some key US businesses by launching antitrust investigations. China also has put in place hefty tariffs of its own on US imports.\n \n\n   \n  Despite several rounds of talks with US trade negotiators, China has continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration. Rare earths, in particular, became a key sticking point, and earlier guarantees of a free-flowing rare-earth market never materialized. Beijing has even tightened its controls by expanding its restrictions earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Under Thursday’s deal, China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, TikTok’s future in the US remains uncertain after rounds of trade talks between the two countries. Beijing stopped short of confirming a final deal on TikTok has been reached following the Xi-Trump meeting, pledging only to work with the US to “properly address” the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently acknowledged that China often fails to hold up its end of the bargain – including when he  announced in November  2024 that he would raise tariffs on China because of the fentanyl crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social several weeks after Election Day. Then President-elect Trump claimed that Chinese officials promised him the country would execute drug dealers caught funneling drugs into the United States but “never followed through.”\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump is making a deal\n \n\n   \n  So why would Trump make a deal with China on fentanyl now if Xi keeps reneging?\n \n\n   \n  First, China has taken honest-to-goodness action on fentanyl. For example, the country over the summer added two more elements used to make fentanyl to its list of controlled substances. When criminal networks adapted and began selling those elements on the black market, China worked to thwart those exports, too.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Thursday cited China’s  “ very strong action ”  in cracking down on fentanyl as a reason for lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  It appears that some  progress has been made on reducing fentanyl  emanating from China in recent years – and there’s some limited evidence that China’s actions are making an impact since Trump’s tariffs went into effect. The US Drug Enforcement Agency in an  annual report  released in May said fentanyl purity declined throughout 2024, consistent with indications that fentanyl cooks in Mexico were having trouble obtaining key precursor chemicals. US Customs and Border Protection have also  reported  that fentanyl stopped at the border was down in 2024 and is on pace to fall again in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may or may not agree that China has made progress on fentanyl, but he sounded a different note on the subject this week than he has sung in the past. He claimed Wednesday that “China is going to be working with me” on restricting the drug.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that they’re going to help us with the fentanyl situation,” Trump said. “They’re going to be doing what they can do.”\n \n\n   \n  Second, China holds significant leverage over the United States. Trump’s tariffs have backfired in numerous ways, including by angering US farmers – a key voting bloc – and creating a rare-earth shortage. China has also refused to fully open up their market to American AI chips, a major Trump goal to help cement US dominance in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs remain one key lever that Trump can pull, even as China has found markets outside the United States willing to buy its goods, blunting the damage Trump’s levies have imposed.\n \n\n   \n  Still, reducing tariffs represents one key Chinese demand. Trump’s meeting with Xi was another.\n \n\n   \n  Giving up some of that ground – particularly if China has shown some goodwill on fentanyl – gives Trump some ability to get what he wants out of these negotiations. In a vague statement on Thursday, China said it will make “corresponding adjustments” to its countermeasures on fentanyl-related tariffs after Trump agreed to cut the levies by half.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  A potential problem for the United States: The other two countries on which the Trump administration has imposed fentanyl tariffs – Mexico and Canada – probably watched Thursday’s announcement with a raised eyebrow and some raised blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries have also made real efforts to restrict fentanyl coming over the US border. And fentanyl coming in from Canada has never posed a major problem, making up less than 1% of overall fentanyl coming into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, Trump has threatened to raise  Mexico’s  and  Canada’s tariffs  while he is reducing tariffs on China. The deal could improve America’s relationship with its chief economic adversary while angering key allies and its two biggest trading partners.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the reduction in tariffs could help Americans who are paying the price. Albeit slowly, tariffs have raised prices in the United States. Any reduction will be welcome news for inflation-wary consumers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Liu and Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/boxing-mayweather-pacquiao-rematch-negotiations-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00-04:00","title":"Blockbuster rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao ‘almost’ agreed","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a decade since their 2015 'Fight of the Century' bout, where Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeated Manny Pacquiao by unanimous decision, the two boxers are reportedly in negotiations for a rematch.

EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A landmark meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on  the sidelines of an international summit  in South Korea Thursday appears to have made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.\n \n\n   \n  “Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.\n \n\n   \n  The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls  on rare earth minerals , in exchange for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.\n \n\n   \n  In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.\n \n\n   \n  Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.\n \n\n   \n  One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.\n \n\n   \n  The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.\n \n\n   \n  In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.\n \n\n   \n    Troubled trade\n \n\n   \n  The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.\n \n\n   \n  At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/andrew-cuomo-mamdani-nyc-mayor-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"In his last stand, Andrew Cuomo zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final stretch of the 2025 New York City mayoral campaign, Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, relaunched his candidacy after a primary defeat, emphasizing his experience and legacy of progressive policies to counter the rising support of Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic candidate known for his democratic socialist platform and social media savvy.

despair about NYC race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 18%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/5-things-to-know-for-oct-30-trump-xi-meeting-nuclear-weapons-hurricane-melissa-food-banks-louvre-heist-suspects","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:50:00-04:00","title":"5 Things to Know for Oct. 30: Trump-Xi Meeting, Nuclear Weapons, Hurricane Melissa, Food Banks, Louvre Heist Suspects","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A multifaceted news update from October 30, 2025, covers several major global developments: a landmark summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, where they agreed on trade, rare earths, and fentanyl issues, potentially resetting U.S.-China relations; the U.S. announcement of resuming nuclear weapons testing after a 30-year hiatus, raising global security concerns; Hurricane Melissa strengthening into a Category 2 storm and causing catastrophic damage across the Caribbean with at least 30 deaths; a looming federal food assistance shutdown threatening millions of Americans with hunger, especially during the holiday season as food banks report capacity overloads; and the arrest of five new suspects in the high-profile Louvre heist, where over $100 million in jewelry was stolen in seven minutes.

Chinese officials said a consensus has been reached with the US on “important economic and trade issues,” but did not provide further details about an agreement.\n \n\n   \n    2️⃣ Nuclear weapons\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before his meeting with China’s Xi Jinping, President Trump announced that the  US would start testing nuclear weapons  after a 30-year hiatus. “We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don’t do testing … but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said Tuesday, referring to China and Russia. Asked whether he’s concerned about the US entering a riskier nuclear environment, Trump replied, “I think we have it pretty well locked up.” He mentioned that he  would like to see denuclearization  but reiterated that such testing is “appropriate” at this time. None of the three major nuclear powers — Russia, the US and China — has tested a nuclear weapon since China did so in 1996. Russia’s last nuclear test was in 1990 and the US last set off a nuclear device in 1992.\n \n\n   \n    3️⃣ Hurricane Melissa\n \n\n   \n  Melissa has restrengthened into a Category 2 hurricane as it moves away from the Bahamas and heads northeast toward Bermuda. The storm has already carved a  trail of destruction across the Caribbean , hammering Jamaica, Cuba and neighboring islands with torrential rain and powerful winds. Officials say Melissa has killed at least 30 people — though the actual toll is uncertain as authorities continue assessing the damage. In Cuba, flooding remains the biggest concern hours after the storm slammed into the island on Wednesday. Meanwhile, officials in Jamaica say “catastrophic” isn’t a strong enough word to describe the scale of devastation in some of the hardest-hit areas. More than 70% the country is without power and officials warn that repairing critical infrastructure could take weeks, if not longer.\n \n\n   \n    4️⃣ Food banks\n \n\n   \n  With the government shutdown now entering its 30th day, the looming suspension of federal food benefits in November threatens to leave millions of Americans at risk of going hungry. Many food banks and charities say they are now bracing for a grim holiday season as demand for assistance is expected to surge. More than a dozen large and small charitable nonprofits told CNN  that they have exceeded their capacity to help  and warned that the level of support they can provide will fall short as Thanksgiving approaches. The Trump administration has signaled that it doesn’t have the funds to provide food stamps to nearly 42 million Americans next month, prompting states across the US to try to step in with their own food-assistance programs.\n \n\n   \n    5️⃣ Louvre heist suspects\n \n\n   \n  Five new suspects have been arrested over the theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre museum, the Paris prosecutor announced today. The arrests come almost two weeks after the brazen seven-minute daylight heist on October 19, when thieves  escaped with jewelry valued at over $100 million . Among the new suspects apprehended is a man believed to have been part of the four-person gang that carried out the heist, Laure Beccuau told French radio RTL. Beccuau said the investigation had not yet uncovered any of the looted treasures. The crime of theft as part of an organized gang carries a potential 15-year prison sentence and a hefty fine, the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n    Breakfast browse\n \n\n   \n    WWI soldiers’ messages in a bottle found over 100 years later\n \n\n   \n  The messages dated 1916 were found wet on an Australian beach, but the writing remained legible.

\n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:05 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Danny Rensch is at the vanguard of chess.\n \n\n   \n  He, alongside a few others, has helped to develop the sport from one which was played by the elites to a phenomenon that has exploded in recent years, particularly thanks to the rising popularity of online chess.\n \n\n   \n  But to get to where he is now – a self-described “shepherd” for chess in his role as chief chess officer at Chess.com – Rensch has been on quite the life path.\n \n\n   \n  As he describes in his new memoir, “Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life,” Rensch was raised in Arizona in what he describes as a cult, a group that he says orchestrated a separation from his own mother and exploited his proficiency at playing chess for its own reputational gain.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch had to overcome many hurdles: Surviving emotional and substance abuse, developing tinnitus and allegedly being manipulated by a charismatic leader by being told he’d be the savior of chess. But along the way, his journey has taken him from a small commune to becoming a guiding light in a sport which, he believes, still has plenty of opportunity to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the hardship and trauma he’s dealt with over his life, Rensch says he doesn’t hold any resentment. He believes the struggles of his past are all part of life’s rich tapestry, highlighting a quote from influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as the motto he lives by: “We are not what happens to us, we are what we choose to become.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we can learn through pain and suffering sadly, but also it can give us an appreciation for what we have,” Rensch told CNN Sports. “Part of my journey is that what grief has taught me is that your relationships are what matter the most and connecting with other people through whatever you’re doing is what actually gives you purpose.\n \n\n   \n  “Your purpose is not anything you do. It is what you feel and what you find within why you do it. And I adhere myself to the fact that I am not what has happened to me. I am what I’ve chosen to become. And I try to take that into everything that I do and everything that we do at Chess.com.”\n \n\n   \n    Life in the ‘Collective’\n \n\n   \n  Growing up, Rensch recalls in his memoir that he was afforded the freedom to run around with children his own age, spending days in the woods with his friends or splashing around in the water.\n \n\n   \n  That was initially what life was like inside the now-disbanded Church of Immortal Consciousness.\n \n\n   \n  According to the group’s beliefs, the Church of Immortal Consciousness followed the teachings of Dr. Pahlvon Duran, a figure who last lived in the 15th century. Rensch describes the group as a spiritual haven for those looking for direction. Known internally as the Collective, the group sought to give lost souls direction – or as they called it, a Purpose – in a supposedly egalitarian society.\n \n\n   \n  Run by Steven and Trina Kamp, the Collective would meet to ensure members focused on their spiritual alignment and, as a group, would pool their money together to ensure they were financially merged.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch recalls they would organize meetings – called Processes – where the members of the Collective would discuss whether or not a fellow member was following the teachings of Duran and, therefore, if they were spiritually pure. Rensch says in his memoir that these meetings often descended into loud arguments due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, and it would not be uncommon for someone to be “glassed” by having a full cup of liquid thrown in their face.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Kamp has previously denied the Church of Immortal Consciousness was a cult.\n \n\n   \n  Families would share accommodations, with Rensch recalling sharing beds with other kids across multiple abodes. But as a child, this was just something he was used to at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Many traveled to the Collective in search of meaning. But, as Rensch came to find out, life in an idealistic commune often doesn’t end in spiritual happiness.\n \n\n   \n  Despite preaching an equal society, it became apparent to Rensch that that wasn’t the case. He references a famous George Orwell quote from the classic novella Animal Farm when describing the hierarchy inside the Collective: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.”\n \n\n   \n  “There were leaders and there was a literal hierarchy, a totem pole system. In some ways, the members self-ranked and sort of self-flagellated in order to keep everything in check,” Rensch explained to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health professional and one of the leading experts on cults, told CNN Sports that these kinds of groups can cause a “dissociative disorder and a disruption of identity” in members.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan has personal experience having been a former member of the  Unification Church , the controversial religion founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and accused by critics of being a cult.\n \n\n   \n  “So in my case, I went from Steven Hassan of Flushing Queens, youngest of three kids, nice Jewish boy, wasn’t political, to a right-wing fascist wanting to take over the world,” Hassan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so I had a pseudo-identity in the image of the cult. So my own critical thinking was pushed down. It wasn’t erased, but it was pushed down. The public has this incorrect assumption that people who get into cults are weak or stupid or uneducated, and it’s just not true. In Danny’s case, he had no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  As a child, the social dynamics of the group didn’t register with Rensch. But in hindsight, he is now able to recognize the pitfalls of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch says in his book that the Kamps were able to weaponize the faith the Collective preached in an attempt to alter people’s life courses for the gain of the individual and the group. Whether it be how they raised their children or the job they were doing, the Kamps could decide whether it was the right fit spiritually and, if not, take steps to adjust.\n \n\n   \n  Also, in the search of spiritual happiness, it was commonplace for families to undergo dramatic changes. Husbands would leave their wives in search of their “Like Vibration” – a better fitting partner in the eyes of the Collective – and Rensch says children would be separated from their parents and adopted into other families to allow the child to flourish.\n \n\n   \n    Separation\n \n\n   \n  Rensch was an ordinary kid who liked ordinary activities. But his whole life changed upon watching the film “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”\n \n\n   \n  He was immediately gripped by a sport which was so different to any other, one which tested the brain in completely different ways than any other.\n \n\n   \n  And, as it turned out, Rensch was good at it from the outset. He would spend hours playing and teaching himself until his skills eventually caught the eye of church leader Steven Kamp.\n \n\n   \n  Kamp, a chess fan himself, saw the potential in Rensch’s game. Rensch said he later came to realize that Kamp saw Rensch’s ability at chess as a way of legitimizing the teachings of the Collective and justify the way the group worked.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Sports has attempted to contact Kamp to offer him the chance to comment.\n \n\n   \n  According to Rensch, Kamp took it upon himself to make sure that the boy received special chess training – including hiring the former Soviet defector, Igor Ivanov – and providing funds and transport so Rensch could travel to tournaments around Arizona and the country to test his skills. More than that, Kamp instructed Rensch that chess had become his Purpose, therefore instilling a religious importance to a game he was in his formative stages in learning.\n \n\n   \n  This added pressure on chess distorted his view on what was meant to be an enjoyable game, Rensch says.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was receiving discipline, to say it was wrapped up in shame and self-worth doesn’t even do it justice because the shame and self-worth was meant to transcend this lifetime. It was meant to transcend the planet,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like: ‘Oh, I’m actually, literally going to hell if I’m not putting my efforts into getting as good as I can at chess all the time.’”\n \n\n   \n  This added attention and time to focus on chess meant Rensch quickly went from promising youngster to tournament winner and chess prodigy. Over his chess career, he would become the youngest national chess master in Arizona history and a multi-time national scholastic champion.\n \n\n   \n  But this success came with a catch: Kamp took it upon himself to push Rensch further and further into the chess world, no matter the consequences, Rensch says. He saw Rensch as a future grandmaster.\n \n\n   \n  The constant flights and elevation changes involved in the journeys he was making across the US resulted in Rensch developing tinnitus, he said, which would eventually develop into chronic pain, infections and sinus pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch describes the most painful moment of his time with the group as being when he was separated from his mother, with his future success at chess given as a main reason why that move was orchestrated.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan said that children being separated from their parents is commonplace in cults, saying “parent alienation” is a typical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “This is something that typically happens with authoritarian cults. One of the parents gets into a cult, the other one doesn’t want to,” Hassan said. “So I’ve seen that one for 48 years. Every single cult does that as a thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rensch’s chess playing career would eventually fizzle out, and looking back in hindsight, his relationship with the sport changed as he grew up and could recognize the environment he was living in.\n \n\n   \n  “The game gave me everything and then it took everything away. And I’ve been to hell and back with chess so many times,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Moving on\n \n\n   \n  As Rensch went through his life in the Collective and his chess playing faded away, his issues continued to pile up.\n \n\n   \n  While he met his wife Shauna and had children of his own, Rensch says he dealt with alcohol and substance abuse as he struggled with the dynamic of the Collective and how he fit in. Shauna was briefly with the Collective when she was six but moved away before returning later in life.\n \n\n   \n  He recalls the moment he decided to leave the Collective shortly after the birth of his second child and coming to the painful realization that it was time to move on.\n \n\n   \n  That decoupling wasn’t an easy thought to process for Rensch, having spent most of his life with the group.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever I could do to myself, whatever baggage I was willing to carry, as long as it was just me, there was probably a part of me that could or would do it forever,” he said. “And that’s part of how you dip in and out of addictive behavior and back out again, you dip in and out of almost ruining your marriage but then barely saving it.”\n \n\n   \n    Stewards\n \n\n   \n  By that point, in 2009, Rensch had begun coaching on Chess.com. It was a humble beginning, but it allowed him to get his foot in the door at an organization which would soon enjoy a meteoric rise.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t easy at the beginning. The website was set up in 2007 and, at that time, the main online chess platform was the Internet Chess Club (ICC).\n \n\n   \n  Through years of development and clever marketing, Chess.com was able to develop into the dominant force of internet chess, with Rensch playing a key role behind that growth.\n \n\n   \n  As well as making it the main platform for coaches to help nurture the next generation of chess stars, a key manta in developing Chess.com was to open the sport to the wider community, with Rensch admitting that the game has at times been a “gatekeep community” by the “intellectually elite or (those who) want to revere and worship the intellectually elite.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were like: ‘This is wrong.’ And I saw that it was wrong from having failed to try to reach the mountain as a prodigy and (Chess.com CEO and co-founder) Erik (Allebest) saw that it was wrong as someone who always loved the game but felt kept out of the club,” Rensch said.\n \n\n   \n  Nowadays, Chess.com is home to over 230 million members, sees more than one billion moves being played every day, and is valued at over $1 billion with no venture backing, according to the company. During those early years as a start-up, the only financial backing the site was ever able to receive was a $70,000 temporary loan from the mom of Allebest’s friend.\n \n\n   \n  As one of the biggest organizations in the sport, Chess.com has also had to weather its fair share of controversy, most notably a  cheating scandal  involving an accusation from Magnus Carlsen that Hans Niemann cheated in an over-the-board game. Niemann was  eventually cleared of cheating  in that particular match.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch said that the episode taught the people involved with Chess.com that it had “way more influence than we thought we did.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the meteoric rise and the sway the site now has over the sport, Rensch and his colleagues see themselves as guiding hands.\n \n\n   \n  “We really are the shepherds of something that belongs to humanity and we do not take that for granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is we always had a bit of an existential – viewing ourselves from 30,000 feet – view that this was kind of bigger than us and that we owed chess the opportunity to reach more people.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/louvre-jewels-heist-arrests-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00-04:00","title":"Five new suspects arrested over Louvre heist – but still no sign of looted jewels","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre museum, bringing the total number of arrests to seven.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Five new suspects have been arrested over the theft of France’s crown jewels from the  Louvre  museum, the Paris prosecutor announced Thursday, bringing the total number of arrests over the  stunning heist  to seven.\n \n\n   \n  Of the five new suspects, one is believed to have been part of the four-man gang who carried out the heist, Laure Beccuau, the prosecutor, told French radio RTL.\n \n\n   \n  This means that, following an 11-day manhunt, police have now arrested three of the four men they believe participated directly in the heist, disguising themselves as construction workers to steal artifacts dating to the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  Beccuau said the investigation had yet to uncover any of the looted treasures, estimated to be worth  more than $100 million . Experts say the jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were likely to be dismantled for their raw materials.\n \n\n   \n  The latest arrests took place Wednesday night in Paris and in the surrounding region, including in Seine-Saint-Denis.\n \n\n   \n  The first two suspects were arrested last weekend, just as one was reported to be trying to flee to Algeria from the Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Those two suspects were placed under formal investigation for organized theft and criminal conspiracy. The pair have  “partially admitted”  their involvement following 96 hours of questioning, Beccuau announced late Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. He was previously known to police for aggravated theft. His DNA was found on glass that had been broken from one of the display cases, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Police did not immediately provide details about the five new suspects.\n \n\n   \n  The heist has captured the world’s attention and raised uncomfortable questions about security arrangements at France’s most-visited museum. Laurence des Cars, the Louvre’s director, admitted to the French Senate that  no security cameras  were monitoring the second-floor balcony where the thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery using an angle grinder on October 19.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/lukoil-to-sell-foreign-assets-gunvor-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:18:00-04:00","title":"Crushed by punishing US sanctions, Russia’s Lukoil sells its international business","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, has accepted an offer from global commodity trader Gunvor to sell its foreign assets in response to U.S. sanctions imposed following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Pentagon to start testing nuclear weapons ‘on an equal basis’ with Russia and China \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, Brad Lendon, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:32 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to begin testing US nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Russia and China, heralding a potentially major shift in decades of US policy at a time of growing tensions between the world’s nuclear-armed superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made the announcement moments before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, for what had been billed as make-or-break talks intended to restore stability after almost a year of trade and economic turmoil.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on social media Trump said, “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China as “a distant third” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system. Not since the 1990s has one of the world’s three major military powers conducted a nuclear weapons test, with China having conducted its last known test in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, when it began a voluntary moratorium on such explosive testing. It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.\n \n\n   \n  Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal,  according to  the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  “There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.\n \n\n   \n  “All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.\n \n\n   \n  China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years,  according to the Federation of American Scientists , and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  At  a military parade  in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”\n \n\n   \n  “They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”\n \n\n   \n  The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.\n \n\n   \n    A new arms race?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.\n \n\n   \n  But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.\n \n\n   \n  “If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.\n \n\n   \n  There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing.  CNN reported in 2023  that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/rare-earth-minerals-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-04:00","title":"What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump’s trade deal with China?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US-China trade deal announced at the APEC summit in South Korea addresses a long-standing dispute over rare earth minerals, which China has leveraged through strict export controls.

Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US trade deal with China seeks to resolve a major sticking point of their ongoing trade war: rare-earth minerals.\n \n\n   \n  Despite multiple rounds of talks with US trade negotiators over the past several months, China continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration that it would free up crucial rare-earth metals, and earlier guarantees of expedited rare-earth licenses to US companies never materialized. Beijing even  tightened earlier this month  its controls by massively expanding its restrictions..\n \n\n   \n  Under  Thursday’s deal , China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China  for years  has built up near-total control of the   minerals   as part of its wider  industrial policy .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about rare earths.\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths, and are they actually ‘rare?’\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths include   17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.\n \n\n   \n  The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are   also  environmentally damaging .\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths used for?\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research  note  from CSIS.\n \n\n   \n    Where do rare earths come from?\n \n\n   \n  Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls  92%  of the global output in the processing stage.\n \n\n   \n  There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.\n \n\n   \n    Why do rare earths matter in the trade war?\n \n\n   \n  Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions were a major topic of conversation when Xi and Trump met Thursday at the APEC summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, China  added five rare-earth elements  – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12.   China also required licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that  China violated a trade truce  as   Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.\n \n\n   \n  The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a  US Geological Survey report .\n \n\n   \n  But China’s latest restrictions were seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nectar Gan, John Liu, Donald Judd, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly and David Goldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/dutch-election-poll-d66-party-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:05:00-04:00","title":"Dutch far right loses ground, opening door for centrist coalition talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 Dutch general election, Geert Wilders’ far-right Freedom Party (PVV) lost significant support, falling from 37 seats in 2023 to a tie with the centrist D66 in projected parliamentary seats.

But vote counting later indicated a slightly stronger showing for PVV.\n \n\n   \n  The shift in the early hours of Thursday was unlikely to alter the composition of the next government coalition, and the result seemed to open a path for D66 leader Jetten to form a government as the Netherlands’ youngest prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very excited that we’re going to have the first homosexual prime minister in the Netherlands and also one that is combining all the positive forces,” Lotte van Slooten, a 25-year-old voter, said at the D66 rally.\n \n\n   \n  Wilders said he would take the lead in forming a government if the PVV ultimately came out on top.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as it’s not 100% clear, D66 can’t take the lead. We will do everything we can to prevent that,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Vote counting was under way in areas including parts of Amsterdam, which is more favorable to D66, but also in the Limburg area, which tends to favor PVV more.\n \n\n   \n  Results from the Dutch Caribbean islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba could also make a marginal difference in the final tally. In 2023, D66 bested VVD there by about 1,400 votes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/faa-workers-without-paycheck","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:30:00-04:30","title":"The stress is just always there, as thousands of FAA workers go without paycheck","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a recent government shutdown, thousands of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) workers—particularly radar technicians and air traffic controllers—are working without pay while continuing critical safety duties.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For certain workers at the Federal Aviation Administration, the government shutdown hit hardest this week with a $0 paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  It’s “disheartening,” to not be paid by an employer, said Cleverson Schmidt, a radar technician based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay level, and I’m praying I don’t get a heart attack or stroke,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  His job, which he is required to do even though he is not being paid, includes certifying aircraft systems for controllers to use. The equipment has to be flawless, he said. It’s how controllers make air traffic decisions with planes full of hundreds of passengers.\n \n\n   \n  His family mostly relies on his income, as his wife works part-time and stays home with their son.\n \n\n   \n  It broke Schmidt’s heart as a father to tell his son a month ago that he couldn’t get his allowance due to the family’s financial situation.\n \n\n   \n  “Having to tell your child that you can’t provide for them is a difficult burden,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Working six days a week and now not getting paid\n \n\n   \n  Many of these critical federal jobs were understaffed, and the people who do them overworked even before the shutdown, making the gap in pay even harder to take.\n \n\n   \n  Corinne Wiseman’s husband – a controller at the Boston TRACON - supports them on his sole income, often working Thursday through Monday and then a sixth day on Tuesday, when he must pick up mandatory overtime.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s not really home,” Wiseman said. “He doesn’t already see his kids hardly at all. Not his fault. It’s his schedule.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has omitted her husband’s name to maintain his anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  The schedules at the FAA are demanding – oftentimes controllers work long hours through the evenings or overnights, making critical decisions and setting personal life aside to maintain the safety of the flying public.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman said it is “hard to not get personal about it,” knowing that her husband has missed years with their four children already, and now he’s not getting paid to do his job and support his family. Her husband has built up exhaustion and resentment, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “(Being an air traffic controller) has been my husband’s dream for almost two decades and in the last five years, I have only seen a decline in his mindset,” she said. “He loves the work, he is angry that the federal government could get away treating them the way they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, some controllers are calling out sick causing a rippling effect of staffing shortages and delays.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to this shutdown, the family had taken out a loan to complete some much-needed repairs around their home. That included new windows, a new roof and more, she said. Now, they’re left to cut costs elsewhere to ensure bills get paid. She said the family keeps the heat off in the house for as long as possible and mostly uses firewood to keep warm.\n \n\n   \n  “As a spouse, watching your significant other feel the full weight of the financial strain of the family while also being unable to physically be present is painful and stressful,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman stays home to take care of their children, but since the shutdown she has been looking for an online job to help their family while still managing their schedules.\n \n\n   \n  “In our family, the stress is just always there, just because the career itself is already extremely stressful and takes a lot of time away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    No end in sight\n \n\n   \n  For now, Schmidt is calling creditors to figure out what bills must be paid. He takes side jobs to make extra cash, and many of his colleagues are doing the same, he said. Schmidt’s union, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, represents about 11,000 FAA employees. About 5,000 of them, like Schmidt, are working without pay during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay strong and do my job with dignity and with the best of my ability,” Schmidt said. “I don’t think I could handle if I was responsible for a loss of life, a loss of lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Keeping the public safe is something that drives many aviation workers, even when they aren’t getting paid, despite the hardships on their families.\n \n\n   \n  As the holidays approach, Wiseman’s family of six is already making adjustments to pinch pennies where needed. She’s canceled or postponed doctor’s appointments, chiropractic care and vet appointments to avoid co-pays or bills piling up.\n \n\n   \n  All four of Wiseman’s children are in their pre-teen to teenage years, involved in activities and costly sports. One has even started driving, which helps Wiseman keep up with the schedules, but adds another cost given high car insurance rates for a new driver.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been just trying to be very frugal, like extra spending at a very bare minimum,” she said, noting the family doesn’t eat out anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman’s children carpool for sports to avoid additional expenses. The couple is not sending their youngest son to an out-of-state hockey tournament in two weeks because of the financial strain it would cause. He’s a goalie.\n \n\n   \n  The family has been through this before. In January 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers, which didn’t include Wiseman’s husband, to call out sick helped end that 35-day long shutdown. Their absence temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  How this shutdown will end is anyone’s guess, but for now these families are struggling to cover their costs as they still report to work.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:05:00-04:05","title":"Testimony is underway in a $40 million lawsuit over a 6-year-old student shooting a teacher","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A $40 million civil lawsuit has been filed against former assistant principal Ebony Parker of Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, alleging that she ignored multiple warnings — including from teachers and staff — that a 6-year-old student had a gun and was exhibiting violent behavior.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:05 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner told the court Wednesday of her twin sister as Abby Zwerner wiped away tears.\n \n\n   \n  Hannah Zwerner was testifying at the civil trial against an ex-assistant principal accused of ignoring multiple warning signs a 6-year-old student had a gun hours before Abby Zwerner was shot in her classroom in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting dimmed a sister who used to be a bright light, said Hannah. “She had a lot to be excited about — and she doesn’t anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  Abby Zwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit against former school administrator Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial offers a peek inside some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n  Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare, a law professor at the University of Virginia told CNN, and this case could set a precedent for future events as US communities grapple with questions of responsibility after a school is scarred by gun violence.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know as the civil case against Parker is underway.\n \n\n   \n    Official ignored warning signs, lawsuit alleges\n \n\n   \n  The  lawsuit alleges  Parker ignored concerns and warning signs brought up by several teachers and staff members, including that the student may have had a gun in his procession hours before the January 6, 2023 shooting at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Parker is accused of ignoring “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and that the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  A guidance counselor and administrator at the elementary school said Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his mother would pick him up soon, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Parker was informed by Zwerner that the student was in a “violent mood,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was required to be accompanied by a parent during the school day during the first half of the school year “because of his violent tendencies.” But the day of the shooting, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied without a companion during the school day,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  During the previous school year, the boy strangled and choked a teacher and pulled up a female classmate’s dress and touched her inappropriately on the school playground, the lawsuit details.\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led up to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n  Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal was reassigned to another school. The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Injuries were devastating\n \n\n   \n  The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.\n \n\n   \n  After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.\n \n\n   \n  A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.\n \n\n   \n  In another emotional courtroom moment in December 2023, Zwerner read a statement during the sentencing of the student’s mother on charges related to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “The boy pointed the gun directly at me and shot. The single bullet went through my left hand and lodged into my upper left chest, leaving traces of bullet fragments in both areas that will remain forever,” Zwerner said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happened and emergency responders worked to keep me alive, I was not sure whether it would be my final moment on earth.”\n \n\n   \n    School official is only defendant\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit filed months after the shooting. A judge previously dismissed the other original defendants, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was  sentenced  to a total of nearly four years in prison for    child neglect and federal weapons charges.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was  not charged  with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother  previously told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  However, prosecutors  later said  authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock. The boy stood on a dresser drawer and took the gun from his mother’s purse.  ﻿ He then brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s mother had no criminal record and cooperated with authorities since the shooting. She  turned herself in  to police after state charges were filed  against her and was released after posting a $5,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n    Case could set precedent\n \n\n   \n  Because attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, this case could set a precedent, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The closest thing to something like the case against Parker is when charges were filed against the deputy who stayed outside   during   the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida ,  he said. The deputy in that case  was acquitted  on all counts against him in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  As of October 26, there have been  356 mass shootings  in the US this year, leaving  at least 300 people dead  and 1,600 injured,  according to  data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one that injured or killed four or more people.\n \n\n   \n  Charging school officials for neglect appears to be an “emerging strategy,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to be kind of the only strategy left that we can put responsibility on the people who provide access to guns, at least to children, at least to school children and children under 16 or 18,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the civil trial could be a “dry run” for what’s to come in the criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone on both sides the prosecution and the defense should have a very clear idea of what the evidence is going to be and what the witnesses are going to say,” the professor said.\n \n\n   \n  The cases could end up setting “a very big” precedent and lead to school officials more aware of their duties to act on any information they have about a child with a gun or who poses a danger to students and staff, Brown said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/louvre-heist-suspects-investigation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"02:56:00+00:00","title":"Louvre Heist Suspects Admit Involvement in Jewels Theft","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two suspects arrested in connection with the theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre Museum have admitted involvement in a seven-minute daylight raid on the Apollo Gallery on October 19, 2025.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two suspects arrested in connection with the theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre museum have admitted involvement in  the heist  and have been remanded in custody, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris prosecutor also said the  stolen jewels  are not in the authorities’ possession.\n \n\n   \n  Both suspects were presented before an investigative judge on Wednesday and placed under formal investigation for organized theft and criminal conspiracy, according to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau. The pair had “partially admitted” their involvement under questioning, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The heist – a brazen, seven-minute daylight raid on the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery – captured the world’s attention after thieves escaped with jewels worth tens of millions.\n \n\n   \n  The two men were arrested Saturday evening and held in custody, where they were questioned for 96 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Police arrested a third suspect in the Paris region on Wednesday evening, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported on Thursday, citing sources. That suspect was in police custody, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. He was previously known to police for aggravated theft. His DNA was found on glass that had been broken from one of the display cases, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “There is nothing to suggest that the four perpetrators benefited from any form of inside help within the museum,” Beccuau. said in a Wednesday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The crime of theft as part of an organized gang carries a potential 15-year prison sentence and a heavy fine, the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt, and authorities were able to track down the individuals after analyzing more than 150 DNA samples and examining several items the group left behind, such as gloves, a helmet and high-vis jackets left at the scene.\n \n\n   \n  One of the men was arrested at Charles de Gaulle Airport as he attempted to leave the country. He was stopped during a passport check before he could board an evening flight to Algeria.\n \n\n   \n  The stolen jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were not recovered during the arrests.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre’s upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels, on October 19. They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window. They broke into two high-security display cases and made off with nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million).\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to keep the hope that they will be found and could be returned to the Louvre museum and the nation,” Beccuau added. “These jewels are now unsellable. Anyone who buys them would be guilty of the offence of handling stolen goods. There is still time to return them.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.

has departed Asia without meeting Kim Jong Un. North Koreans don’t seem to care \n       \n  Analysis by Will Ripley, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald Trump  danced on the tarmac  in Malaysia,  met Japan’s emperor  in Tokyo, and  accepted a gold crown  in South Korea, one key question kept following him – would he hold a surprise meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un?\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions  Trump made public overtures  that he’d “love” to meet Kim while in the region. It could have been a made-for-TV sequel to his  surprise 2019 visit at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) , when Trump made history as the first sitting US president to step foot on North Korean soil.\n \n\n   \n  In the end it never came together. And in Pyongyang, just a few hundred miles away, it was like Trump’s trip never happened.\n \n\n   \n  There were no headlines. No television news reports. No mention of the US president’s offer to “work very hard with Kim Jong Un” to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. Even as Trump’s entourage rolled through Asia and speculation swirled about a possible reunion between the two leaders, North Korean state media stayed silent.\n \n\n   \n  American filmmaker and manager at  Young Pioneer Tours  Justin Martell just returned from an eight-day trip to Pyongyang, where he was attending an international film festival that happened to coincide with much of Trump’s Asia trip.\n \n\n   \n  He said most people he spoke with in Pyongyang didn’t even know Trump was in the region, and none were aware that Trump wanted to meet Kim again.\n \n\n   \n  “They weren’t negative about it,” he told CNN. “They weren’t overly hopeful either. They just kept repeating Kim Jong Un’s recent remarks — that while he has warm memories of President Trump, politics are different from feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  Martell said the tone wasn’t hostile, just detached. “It was more or less, ‘Here’s how we feel right now. If it happens, great. If not, it doesn’t really change much.’”\n \n\n   \n  That matter-of-fact indifference marks a striking change from 2018 and 2019, when Trump’s summits with Kim — first in Singapore, then in Hanoi, and later at the DMZ — gripped both capitals and dominated global headlines.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to 2025 and Trump’s overtures barely registered. But there’s good reason for that.\n \n\n   \n  Only last month Kim stood side-by-side with China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in the heart of Beijing at a historic military parade in an unprecedented and  historic show of unity  against the West.\n \n\n   \n  Kim now has Moscow for weapons deals and oil, Beijing for trade, and a domestic narrative of resilience under sanctions and  heroism on the battlefield in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  Frankly, a handshake with the US president no longer carries the weight it once did.\n \n\n   \n    Why the meeting didn’t happen\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the missed meeting with Kim was  “a matter of timing.” \n \n\n   \n  “We never were able to talk because… look I was so busy,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Thursday after departing South Korea and ending his Asia tour.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was also away on a diplomatic mission of her own this week. She first flew to Russia for a  meeting with Putin  to discuss strengthening ties before speaking at an international forum in Belarus.\n \n\n   \n  That made it logistically impossible for North Korea’s top diplomat to help arrange any last-minute meeting between Kim and Trump  as she did in 2019 , when Choe helped pull together the DMZ meeting just hours after  Trump posted on social media  he wanted to meet Kim.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, North Korea test-fired cruise missiles to the west of the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump’s visit, during which he held a summit with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung.\n \n\n   \n  But as Martell’s conversations in Pyongyang suggest, timing may be only part of the story. North Korea simply may no longer feel strongly compelled to say yes.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has made his terms clear: he’ll meet Trump only if Washington abandons what he calls its  “absurd obsession” with denuclearization . In a September speech, he said he still has “fond memories” of Trump, but that his country “will never trade away nuclear weapons to be free of sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, the deal Trump offered six years ago – trading sanctions relief for disarmament – is no longer on the table. North Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.\n \n\n   \n  What Martell saw in Pyongyang underscores why.\n \n\n   \n  The North Korean elite in Pyongyang – whose support is crucial to maintaining national stability, despite Kim’s near-absolute power – appear to be enjoying a higher living standard than previously, with more access to modern technology and amenities. For the elite, at least, sanctions have done little to dent their lives.\n \n\n   \n  Even South Korea’s President Lee seems to recognize the challenges in bringing Kim to the table.\n \n\n   \n   In an interview with me this week , Lee said he hopes Trump can act as a “peacemaker,” while Seoul plays “pacemaker” — creating the conditions for dialogue that remain “difficult” to achieve directly. “If the two leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together,” Lee said, “we would welcome such engagement.”\n \n\n   \n    High-rises and traffic jams in ‘Pyonghattan’\n \n\n   \n  Martell had not been to Pyongyang since 2017. The capital’s development over the past eight years, despite sanctions and the extreme isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, stunned him.\n \n\n   \n  “It used to feel much less developed compared to others in the region,” he said. “Now, honestly, Pyongyang feels very much like a modern city.”\n \n\n   \n  He described futuristic high-rises, residents paying with QR codes, new domestic apps for ordering taxis and food, and social media.\n \n\n   \n  “What used to take twenty minutes now takes forty,” he said, referring to the traffic. “We kept joking with our Korean guides that it was Pyonghattan” because it has developed so much.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the capital’s new Hwasong district, he dined at sleek restaurants offering both Asian and Western menus, with high-end liquor on display. He says all the restaurants were full of locals dining when he visited.\n \n\n   \n  Private car ownership was once rare and politically sensitive. Now, it’s common enough to cause occasional traffic jams in busy areas. “There seems to be a burgeoning middle class now,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  Even outside the capital, he saw evidence of growth. Traveling two hours north to Mount Myohyang, he noticed new housing under construction. “For farmers, too,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite sanctions, he said, “the DPRK seems to be in a much different position than it was ten years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  At a national gallery near Kim Il Sung Square, he saw new murals commemorating 80 years of the Workers’ Party. Toward the end, one section vividly depicted North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Large North Korean-style murals of soldiers fighting Ukrainians — and winning,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Even North Korean cinema has evolved. At the Pyongyang International Film Festival, Martell watched Days and Nights of Confrontation, a new state-produced thriller dramatizing a real-life plot to assassinate Kim Jong Il.\n \n\n   \n  The film featured violence, modern production values, and even brief nudity — all unheard-of in North Korean films. “A character getting suffocated with a plastic bag — that’s something I’ve certainly never seen in a DPRK movie,” he said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s portrait still ‘front and center’\n \n\n   \n  Despite the silence around Trump’s latest Asia visit, he has not been erased from Pyongyang’s official memory.\n \n\n   \n  Martell’s group was the first Western delegation in years to visit the International Friendship Exhibition, a sprawling mountainside museum that displays gifts and artifacts from foreign dignitaries. Taking photos inside the exhibition is strictly forbidden.\n \n\n   \n  “In the section devoted to Kim Jong Un, there were the expected photos — Putin, Lavrov, Xi Jinping, Dennis Rodman,” Martell said. “And President Trump was still there, displayed very prominently.”\n \n\n   \n  Based on my experiences traveling to the country, if the door were truly closed to future dialogue, that photo would probably have been removed.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s still displayed very much front and center,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump has indicated he still wants to meet Kim when he next comes to Asia. “We’ll have other visits, and we’ll work very hard with Kim Jong Un and with everybody on getting things straightened out,” he told reporters on Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/food-banks-snap-funding-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Food banks face a ‘perfect storm’ of surging demand as shutdown drags on","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Food banks across the U.S. are facing a critical crisis due to a combination of a prolonged government shutdown, the imminent suspension of federal food benefits in November, and previous federal budget cuts that have weakened their capacity.

surging demand as shutdown drags on \n       \n  By Michael Williams, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Austin Culpepper, Logan Schiciano, Emily Condon, Sylvie Kirsch, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Demand has doubled at a Washington, DC, food bank over the past few weeks, while another in Texas has been forced to dip into emergency hurricane reserve funds to meet demand. Meanwhile, a Florida charity is giving out 300,000 meals per day but, an official there says, “still it’s not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  After a nearly monthlong  government shutdown , the looming  suspension of federal food benefits  in November is poised to put millions of Americans at risk of going hungry — and food banks and other charities across the country face a bleak outlook as they head into a busy holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen large and small charitable nonprofits told CNN they have exceeded their ability to help and warned that the level of support they can provide will fall far short.\n \n\n   \n  “The real impacts are starting now,” said Brian Greene, CEO of Houston Food Bank. “There’s been some uptick, but nowhere near what we’re going to see by the time we get to early November. … it’s going to be unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  With Thanksgiving just weeks away, hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay are becoming new faces at food banks and other charities, which are also bracing for more demand as the Trump administration signals that it doesn’t have the funds to provide food stamps to nearly 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors combine to form a “perfect storm” that will push charities past their brink, said Miette Michie, a board member of the Emergency Food Network, which serves parts of central Virginia. The volunteer-based food distribution site has consistently been at capacity since the shutdown began, Michie said — at which point all the volunteers can do is tell people to call back the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you angry. … You’re messing with people’s lives here,” Michie told CNN. “This is not just a game, it’s actual people, working people, whose lives are being affected by this.”\n \n\n   \n  Dave Silbert, who leads So What Else, a food bank in Washington, DC, told CNN that “it’s brought a level of chaos and uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  “How do we expand?” he asked. “How do we go from 450,000 pounds of food to 550 or 600,000 pounds of food a week? How do we go from raising $300,000 a month to $400,000 a month?”\n \n\n   \n    States rush to provide support\n \n\n   \n  States across the country are working to fill the gap on their own.\n \n\n   \n  California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster have deployed their state’s National Guard troops to support food banks, and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican,  has signaled he’s prepared  to do so as well.\n \n\n   \n  New Mexico, Minnesota, Washington and West Virginia have announced millions in funding to support relief programs, while Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, is setting up its own food-assistance system for residents who receive SNAP benefits. That program is expected to cost $37.5 million a week and can be funded through November from the state’s surplus, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  But not every state is able to match federal funding. Several nonprofit directors told CNN that food banks were always meant to supplement, not replace, federal aid programs and that the timing of this influx of need will only further stretch social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in Georgia, for example, receive about $250 million in SNAP benefits monthly. Food banks distribute only about $4.5 million worth of food each month, said Amy Breitmann, the CEO Golden Harvest Food Bank, which serves 24 counties in that state and South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  “The food bank is supposed to be the safety net underneath SNAP, right?” Breitmann said. “It’s not supposed to replace that.”\n \n\n   \n    Food banks already reeling from federal cuts\n \n\n   \n  The surge in demand at food banks across the country comes months after the Trump administration terminated millions  in funding for a program  that allowed food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Higgerson, Chief Development Officer of Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, said that there’s been “an erosion of the federal food support,” over the past year. A quarter of the food the Second Harvest Food Bank distributes comes from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Between the shutdown and an already-lost millions of dollars from federal budget cuts this year, the situation is “unprecedented” for the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, a charity that has scrambled to launch pop-up shops in areas with the most SNAP-reliant and federal-worker-heavy communities, said president and CEO Amy Beros. Her group lost $2 million when the local food purchasing program was cut earlier this year and had roughly 80 truckloads cancelled from the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n \n\n   \n  “We know there’s no way for the food banks to fully fill the gap,” Beros said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/democratic-senators-us-military-strikes-briefing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:50:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration cuts Democrats out of a briefing on US military strikes, top Senate Dem says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration conducted a series of military strikes on vessels suspected of drug trafficking, citing intelligence indicating narcotics smuggling.

\nUpdated: \n        11:50 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials briefed Republicans on Wednesday about  US military strikes on suspected drug boats  without telling Democratic members about the briefing, according to a top Senate Democrat and a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner slammed the Trump administration for cutting out Democratic lawmakers Wednesday, calling the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n  During the briefing, administration officials showed the Republicans a classified Justice Department OLC memo outlining the administration’s legal justification for the strikes, which CNN  first reported  on earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Warner said, “shutting Democrats out of a briefing on U.S. military strikes and withholding the legal justification for those strikes from half the Senate is indefensible and dangerous.”\n \n\n   \n  “Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party,” he said. “For any administration to treat them that way erodes our national security and flies in the face of Congress’ constitutional obligation to oversee matters of war and peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “It also sets a reckless and deeply troubling precedent,” the Virginia Democrat continued, adding that the administration should immediately provide Democrats the same briefing and the OLC opinion.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Warner’s comments come as the Trump administration accelerates its attacks against boats that they allege are involved in drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that the US military  conducted another strike against a vessel  in the Pacific Ocean that day, killing four people.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  The action marks the 14th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel. The operations have killed 61 people aboard 15 total boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration told CNN earlier this week that it has provided  seven separate classified briefings  on US military strikes on alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  But some lawmakers have said they have not received the information they want. One Democratic Senate aide told CNN that the administration “appears to be counting the same briefing given multiple times to certain staff or members (including in small groups.) So seven briefings is highly misleading.”\n \n\n   \n  House Armed Services Committee members are expected to get a classified briefing from Pentagon officials on Thursday about the recent US military strikes on boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, two sources told CNN earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/chicago-immigration-gregory-bovino-appeal-granted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00.000Z","title":"Top Border Patrol Official to Be Deposed Thursday Over Agency’s Tactics in the Chicago Area","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is set to undergo a deposition in a lawsuit alleging that federal agents used aggressive and unapproved tactics during Operation Midway Blitz, a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Chicago that has led to over 3,000 arrests since September.

Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to sit for a deposition Thursday morning in a lawsuit over his agency’s immigration enforcement tactics in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The debrief from plaintiff’s attorneys, who accuse federal agents of aggressive behavior against peaceful protesters, is scheduled to last up to five hours. It comes a day after an appeals court halted a judge’s order requiring him to  provide her daily court briefings  on his agents’ activities.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise order Wednesday came just hours before Bovino was meant to brief US District Judge Sara Ellis, who told him Tuesday he must be in court every weekday for the next week as she considers reports that federal agents were not following her order to limit aggressive tactics and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration quickly pressed a federal appeals court to put her order on hold, arguing that Bovino having to appear would be “extraordinarily disruptive” and “irreparably harming the government.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’ requirement “significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.\n \n\n   \n  In a Wednesday afternoon ruling, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted their request, meaning Bovino did not make an appearance in court Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  As the Trump administration carries out targeted immigration enforcement in several major US cities, Bovino has emerged as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago. The targeted operation has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  But the operation has also drawn persistent protests outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, just outside Chicago. While federal agents say threatening protest activity has led them to intensify their crowd control tactics, demonstrators argue their response is often disproportionate.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court’s decision is intended to give the intermediate court time to review a request from the Trump administration to completely scrap Ellis’ order regarding Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Wednesday ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is “thrilled this act of judicial overreach has been paused.”\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear whether Bovino will appear in court to brief the judge Thursday.   \n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a group of protesters, local journalists and clergy members sued the Trump administration, accusing federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators without warning and unlawfully restricting the press.\n \n\n   \n  Before the appeals court ruling, Bovino told Fox News he was anticipating the meetings with the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s gonna have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino said on Fox’s  “The Faulkner Focus”  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino appeared before Ellis on Tuesday after the plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has refuted.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’  restraining order , which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on protesters unless there is an “immediate threat to safety.” It also requires clear warnings before these methods are used.\n \n\n   \n  During Tuesday’s hearing, Ellis expressed concern that her order was not being followed. She cited videos of interactions between agents and crowds, which she said appeared to show agents firing gas without notice and with no apparent threat.\n \n\n   \n  “Halloween is on Friday,” Ellis said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge provided guidance on how agents should comply with the order, including wearing body cameras to document interactions, wearing visible identification and providing clear warnings before deploying gas.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis ordered that all use-of-force reports and body camera footage during those interactions for Operation Midway Blitz from September 2 through last Satur﻿day be turned over to the court under seal by the end of this week.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for next week.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/australia/ww1-letter-in-bottle-found-australia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:25:00-04:00","title":"WWI soldiers’ messages in a bottle found on Australian beach more than 100 years later","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Messages written by two Australian soldiers, Malcolm Neville and William Harley, during their 1916 voyage to the Western Front in World War I were discovered over 100 years later in a Schweppes-brand bottle on Wharton Beach near Esperance, Western Australia.

into their voyage to the battlefields of France during World War I have been found more than a century later on Australia’s coast.\n \n\n   \n  The Brown family found the Schweppes-brand bottle just above the waterline at Wharton Beach near Esperance in Western Australia state on Oct. 9, Deb Brown said on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband Peter and daughter Felicity made the find during one of the family’s regular quad bike expeditions to clear the beach of trash.\n \n\n   \n  “We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,” Deb Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the clear, thick glass were cheerful letters written in pencil by Privates Malcolm Neville, 27, and William Harley, 37, dated Aug. 15, 1916.\n \n\n   \n  Their troop ship HMAT A70 Ballarat had left the South Australia state capital Adelaide to the east on Aug. 12 of that year on the long journey to the other side of the world where its soldiers would reinforce the 48th Australian Infantry Battalion on Europe’s Western Front.\n \n\n   \n  Neville was killed in action a year later. Harley was wounded twice but survived the war dying in Adelaide in 1934 of a cancer his family say was caused by him being gassed by the Germans in the trenches.\n \n\n   \n  Neville requested the bottle’s finder deliver his letter to his mother Robertina Neville at Wilkawatt, now a virtual ghost town in South Australia. Harley, whose mother was dead by 1916, was happy for the finder to keep his note.\n \n\n   \n  Harley wrote “may the finder be as well as we are at present.”\n \n\n   \n  Neville wrote to his mother he was “having a real good time, food is real good so far, with the exception of one meal which we buried at sea.”\n \n\n   \n  The ship was “heaving and rolling, but we are as happy as Larry,” Neville wrote, using a now faded Australian colloquialism meaning very happy.\n \n\n   \n  Neville wrote that he and his comrades were, “Somewhere at Sea.” Harley wrote that they were, “Somewhere in the Bight,” referring to the Great Australian Bight. That’s an enormous open bay that begins east of Adelaide and extends to Esperance on the western edge.\n \n\n   \n  Deb Brown suspects the bottle didn’t travel far. It likely spent more than a century ashore buried in the sand dunes. Extensive erosion of the dunes caused by huge swells along Wharton Beach in recent months probably dislodged it.\n \n\n   \n  The paper was wet, but the writing remained legible. Because of that, Deb Brown was able to notify both soldiers’ relatives of the find.\n \n\n   \n  The bottle “is in pristine condition. It doesn’t have any growth of any barnacles on it.

Trump’s meeting with Xi \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Wayne Chang, Will Ripley, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:45 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Days before President  Donald Trump  departed for Asia where he will sit down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday for their first in-person meeting of his second term, the president refused to count out the possibility of America’s position on Taiwan getting tangled in US-China trade talks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be talking about a lot of things. I assume that’s going to be one of the things, but I’m not going to talk about that now,” Trump said when asked about reports that China may pressure the US to oppose Taiwan’s independence in exchange for a larger trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to definitively count out Taiwan becoming a pawn in trade talks between the world’s two largest economies comes as Trump has privately and publicly suggested he believes China will not invade the self-ruled island that Beijing claims it owns while he is in office – raising questions about how seriously the president will prioritize boosting Taiwan’s defense during his second term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump again gave an evasive answer on Taiwan as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One en route to South Korea Wednesday for the Asia-Pacific Cooperation summit where he will sit down with Xi, saying he is  not even sure  the topic will be raised by the Chinese leader. A senior administration official expressed confidence that Trump would not be backed into stating opposition to Taiwan’s independence during the meeting, adding that the meeting will be focused on Xi “holding a gun to the head of the global economy” with its critical mineral export controls.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said over the weekend that no one in the administration is contemplating a trade deal that includes “favorable treatment” for walking away from Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Some experts remain worried, however, that Trump might be willing to make concessions on Taiwan for a better trade deal, but former Trump administration officials argue that those concerns are over-blown.\n \n\n   \n  “That idea of a grand bargain, of Trump selling out Taiwan, gets most of its oxygen from Chinese Communist Party trial balloons that are floated in US media, and from isolationists on the far left and the far right who believe in appeasement,”   said Matt Pottinger, Chairman of the China Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Trump’s former deputy national security advisor. “Trump understands the strategic nature of Taiwan.”\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is also publicly downplaying concerns about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting, and with a senior Taiwan government official saying they are “cautiously optimistic” about the meeting and pointing to Rubio’s latest remarks as an encouraging sign.\n \n\n   \n  Whenever leaders of the United States and China meet, Taiwan’s government is closely watching and calibrating its own strategy. Very little is typically said publicly given the precarious position Taipei finds itself in – wedged between two superpowers with vastly conflicting agendas and interests.\n \n\n   \n  And Taiwan’s anxieties have amplified in Trump’s second term, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s team is filled with more isolationist and far-right figures than the establishment Republican and Democratic officials who have traditionally shaped US foreign policy. And while Trump has prioritized securing a major trade deal with Beijing, his administration has paused some US military support to the island and complicated basic engagements such as the transit of Taiwan’s president through the US earlier this year, current and former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some stakeholders in Taipei have found it really jarring to be in this position where they’re suddenly so unclear on whether the US president will support them,” said Henrietta Levin, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), adding they have found an “unwelcome surprise” in how challenging it has been to bolster the US-Taiwan relationship this year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went into his first term having taken a phone call from Taiwan’s president  during the transition,  which upended protocol because there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan. His administration then accelerated the sale of weapons to the self-governing island and allowed the transit of Taiwan’s president though the US on multiple occasions – which is in line with past norms.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump came into office for his second term after having repeatedly claimed in recent years that Taiwan “stole” the US chip business, which resonated uneasily in Taipei. He has been careful in public statements about Taiwan, his administration has halted the flow of some weapons from US stockpiles to the island and complicated the transit of the island’s president through the US.\n \n\n   \n    The return of strategic ambiguity, or a downgrade of the relationship?\n \n\n   \n  Some experts make the case that to date, Trump in his second term has acted in line with decades of US policy with a return to strategic ambiguity.\n \n\n   \n  While it may be a hard shift after former President Joe Biden declared multiple times while he was in office that the US would militarily defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, they say it’s not an abnormal approach.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at Obama, Bush before that, it’s always been a little bit of a hands-off approach, and trying to keep Taiwan at arm’s length and being very careful about any messages you sent to China. So, we are somewhat back to that new normal again,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a foreign policy think tank.\n \n\n   \n  But Taiwan is grappling with whether the current state of the relationship with the US is a short-term aberration as Trump focuses on a productive meeting with Xi, or more of a long-term reality.\n \n\n   \n  It has led them to parse over the deeper meaning of every single engagement with the administration – or lack thereof.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this fall, there was a gathering on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly with Taiwan’s foreign minister at Le Bernardin, an upscale New York restaurant. Multiple senior US administration officials were expected to attend but they didn’t show up, according to a source who attended the gathering. Even though the administration signaled through intermediaries that the no-show was simply the unintended consequence of over-packed schedules, it left Taiwan feeling defeated, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The island is actively re-evaluating how they can move to bring the Trump administration to their side, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Facing pressure from both Washington and Beijing, President Lai Ching-te has pledged to raise defense spending sharply to 3.32% of GDP by 2026 and 5% by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  But there are also actions that are being taken – or considered – that won’t attract headlines but could impact the overall relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One option being considered is recalling their de facto ambassador to the US Alexander Yui in order to replace him with a diplomat who is more politically savvy, sources said. Some Trump administration officials have said that the current career diplomat doesn’t have the juice to effectively engage despite support from some close to the president, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan flatly denied that suggestion on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Taiwan and the US maintains a smooth communication channel,” Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, told a legislative committee meeting. “Our representative office in the US has been functioning well. We are not recalling him.”\n \n\n   \n  Taipei has also launched an unprecedented charm offensive aimed at conservative media figures and influencers aligned with Trump’s movement.\n \n\n   \n  President Lai granted  a rare interview  to radio host Buck Sexton, praising Trump and even suggesting he would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he could persuade China to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President  Hsiao Bi-khim spoke with  YouTuber Shawn Ryan, while Taiwan’s de facto ambassador appeared on Steve Bannon’s podcast and hosted Ryan at Twin Oaks, the historic ambassadorial residence in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Such outreach marks a sharp departure from Taipei’s conventional diplomatic approach, underscoring its effort to engage directly with the Trump-aligned ecosystem currently shaping US foreign policy discourse.\n \n\n   \n  Taipei is also trying to offset its US trade deficit by purchasing 6 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alaska, a move officials describe as both an energy-security measure and a goodwill gesture toward Washington while they are still working on a trade deal between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Taiwan is not willing to concede to the US across the board. The island   vowed  to resist pressure  from Washington to shift half of its chip production capacity to the United States, throwing down the gauntlet to the Trump administration just earlier this month. The subject is expected to continue as an active piece of the ongoing trade talks between the US and Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n    Making Taiwan a porcupine ‘without giving Beijing the middle finger’\n \n\n   \n  Chinese leader Xi Jinping views Taiwan’s “reunification” with the mainland as a core requirement for the sweeping vision of a “national rejuvenation” China aims to achieve by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Communist Party officials recently drew up their upcoming five-year plan, which analysts expect will see Beijing prioritize greater economic integration with Taiwan as part of its push for “peaceful reunification.” State media on Monday released a sweeping commentary laying out the many economic carrots it said would be available to Taiwan’s people “after reunification.”\n \n\n   \n  China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has not ruled out using force to take control of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US officials have said that Xi has ordered the country’s military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration plans to adopt a policy on Taiwan with the goal of making the island a “porcupine” by investing strategically in precision and smaller weapons built for asymmetric warfare to deter Chinese aggression or make an invasion so costly and painful that costs would outweigh benefits, two sources briefed on the policy discussions said. US officials also want to get Taiwan to that place “without giving Beijing the middle finger,” the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration refused to green-light the transfer of US weapons stocks to Taiwan earlier this year, under a process known as Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), sources said. The move led to questions about the US military’s commitment to Taiwan. But the move was not meant to signal a complete abdication of US support, sources said. While the administration does not want Taiwan pulling from US weapons stocks — with one administration official pointing out that most of the stockpiled weapons that the US can give to Taiwan would be ineffective in a fight against China — there are no plans to halt sales of weapons which would be purchased by Taiwan, administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Taiwan to put in more orders for military equipment, and they are still waiting on those new orders, the senior administration official said. This private push comes as the administration has made clear that it views the economically prosperous island through the same lens that it views Europe – that it must invest more towards its own defense.\n \n\n   \n  Still, speed needs to be addressed. Taipei is waiting on a backlog of more than $20 billion in undelivered US military equipment, with production times in the US delayed in part because of the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the delayed National Defense Strategy from the Pentagon and internal disagreement over the extent to which the administration plans to prioritize sending military resources to the Western Hemisphere and Europe versus the Pacific is raising questions about the military focus and resources that will actually be put towards Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Dictating the flow of US arms to allies and partners would typically be the job of the defense secretary but the Pentagon has tried to make those calls in recent months with policy memos that have at times been slapped down by Trump directly, sources pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has publicly claimed in recent weeks that Xi won’t invade Taiwan because of US military strength.\n \n\n   \n  “China doesn’t want to do that. First of all, United States is the strongest military power in the world by far, it’s not even close,” Trump said earlier this month. “Nobody’s going to mess with that and I don’t see that at all with President Xi.”\n \n\n   \n  While US officials claim Taiwan must act more quickly to shore up its own defenses, there are concerns on the island that Trump’s personal conviction that Xi will not invade while he is in office could impede the US from effectively boosting their military capabilities in the coming years.\n \n\n   \n  “They are concerned about that, so if there’s no invasion until 2029, but all the time between now and then is wasted, both on the US side and the Taiwanese side, that will set us up for a disaster in 2029 or 2030,” Alperovitch said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/americas/pictures-devastating-aftermath-hurricane-melissa-jamaica-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:25:00-04:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa devastates Jamaica: in pictures","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday, October 28, 2025, causing catastrophic damage in coastal towns like Black River and Montego Bay.

from space in new satellite images obtained from Vantor.\n \n\n   \n  The storm made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a monstrous Category 5 hurricane before moving onto to Cuba on Wednesday and later, the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  These aerial images show widespread flooding and  extensive damage  in towns along Jamaica’s southwest coast in the parish of St. Elizabeth and, on the opposite side of the island in Montego Bay, the capital of St. James parish. The storm first made landfall on Jamaica’s southwest coast near the town of Black River, seen in part here.\n \n\n   \n  Damage to homes, businesses and community centers in Black River is extensive – even seen in this limited scope. This satellite photo taken after the storm shows the roof of one of the largest markets in the neighborhood ripped cleanly off its foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Coastal communities were hit hardest by the storm’s devastating winds, with some remote fishing villages nearly flattened by the hurricane. In the town of White House, less than 10 miles northwest of Black River, small boats were washed ashore in a town where the economy is reliant on its closeness to the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  As the storm progressed north, it drenched rural farmlands across St. Elizabeth Parish, a southwestern region that’s become Jamaica’s breadbasket. Footage captured on the ground showed just how quickly the low-lying farmlands were submerged by rainwater.\n \n\n   \n  An image captured less than 24 hours after the floodwaters rushed in shows inundated farmlands and vegetation stripped from large swathes of agricultural land.\n \n\n   \n  On the opposite coast, Hurricane Melissa swept through Montego Bay, in Jamaica’s north. This satellite image captured in its aftermath shows extensive flooding throughout the city and large pools of water around storage facilities at the city’s main port.\n \n\n   \n  As the storm moved out to sea, it pulled debris and muddy water through the Barnett and Pye Rivers, seen at the center of the frame.

starting to rebel against the national redistricting push \n       \n  By Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  National political leaders are making frantic, last-ditch efforts in multiple states to  redraw more US House districts  ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  But their ambitions face big political and procedural obstacles and in some cases, open rebellion from state lawmakers pushing back against pressure from the top leaders in their own parties.\n \n\n   \n  Consider Kansas, where Republican lawmakers are trying to force a special session and join the wave of states undertaking once-rare, mid-decade redistricting to gain an edge in the 2026 congressional elections. GOP leaders this week were working to secure the signatures from two-thirds of lawmakers in both chambers needed to bypass the state’s Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and proceed. On the line: the US House seat currently held by four-term Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s terrible for democracy,” said Kansas state Rep. Mark Schreiber, one of the remaining Republican holdouts, in an interview with CNN. “It’s fairly simple: Redistricting was meant to accommodate changes in the population, based on the decennial census, and that’s it.”\n \n\n   \n  “This mid-cycle redistricting is being done only for political purposes, in this case to maintain a Republican majority in the US House,” Schreiber added. “I don’t think that’s an appropriate use.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have faced resistance as they ramp up their redistricting campaign. In Maryland, for instance, a top Democratic lawmaker has balked at taking up map-drawing, warning it will only escalate the ongoing redistricting arms race and help Republicans in the end. National Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections. If Democrats gain three seats next year, they will win the House and obtain the power to block parts of President Donald Trump’s agenda. But Republicans have more opportunities than Democrats do to shape the election outcome through congressional mapmaking.\n \n\n   \n  So far, GOP lawmakers have redrawn seats in three states – Texas, Missouri and North Carolina – to add a  total of seven potential seats  to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the Democrats’ push\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the political arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to undertake redistricting and create five additional GOP-friendly seats. Next week, California voters will decide whether to counter that and  approve five additional Democratic-friendly seats , representing the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state.\n \n\n   \n  The states now eyeing new maps represent “the third-tier opportunities for redistricting,” said Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of Inside Elections, an independent political newsletter. But, he said, “in order to squeeze an advantage, you have to go piecemeal once you get beyond the big hitters. For Democrats, especially, California is all they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia, a purple state where Democrats hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature, is potentially the biggest remaining redistricting prize for the party. Democrats currently hold six of the state’s 11 seats in the US House, and an aggressive map redraw could potentially give the party nine or 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  But it will take a monthslong effort to get there as lawmakers tackle multiple hurdles to bypass the redistricting process the state established five years ago. Under current law, the power to redistrict rests with a bipartisan redistricting commission created by voters through a constitutional amendment.\n \n\n   \n  First, Democrats must pass language to amend the state constitution before Tuesday’s elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Then, it must be approved again next year in a second legislative session before voters have their say in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Republicans have signaled that they intend to mount legal challenges to any action by the legislature, arguing that Democrats already have run afoul of a requirement to pass the proposed constitutional amendment before the election since early voting is underway.\n \n\n   \n  The US House’s top Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is working to persuade Illinois lawmakers to eke out an additional seat there, despite objections from the head of the state Senate’s Black caucus. In Jeffries’ home state of New York, a  new lawsuit  by a leading Democratic-aligned elections firm takes aim at the sole Republican-held seat in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting with Jeffries this week, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said in a statement that “all options must remain on the table to protect our democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  But at least one Democrat in the state – state Sen. Willie Preston, who heads the Black caucus in his chamber – has opposed it, arguing the new map risks diluting Black political power in the state. Preston is running for a US House seat now held by Rep. Robin Kelly. Kelly is running for an open US Senate seat to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.\n \n\n   \n  “Black Democrats have given our all to our party - the answer to fighting back against Trump’s efforts to crush Black political power cannot be diluting Black political power,” Preston said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  In deep-blue Maryland, the state Senate President William Ferguson has publicly opposed map-drawing targeting the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation. But other Democrats, including Jeffries, insisted Wednesday that redistricting remains a viable option in the state.\n \n\n   \n    Rare GOP resistance to Trump\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, the most immediate battleground is Indiana, where GOP Gov. Mike Braun has announced a special legislative session starting next week to tackle a redistricting plan that could possibly yield two more seats for his party – although it’s uncertain that the plan has enough support among Republicans in the state Senate majority to succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Some Indiana Republicans have been among those resisting Trump’s moves, despite significant lobbying by the president and two visits to the state by Vice President JD Vance. Braun, a staunch Trump ally, has called legislators back to the statehouse to start working on a redraw next week.\n \n\n   \n  But on the same day that Braun announced the legislative session, Molly Swigart, a spokeswoman for the top Republican in the state Senate, said there still were not enough Republican votes to support redistricting in that chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Wednesday for an update, Swigart   responded: “I do not have anything new to share.”\n \n\n   \n  Prominent Republicans in the state, including former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, have opposed the redistricting. Under the current map, the GOP holds seven of the state’s nine US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent Washington Post column , Daniels said the current map is fair and urged Republicans in the Hoosier State to continue to resist. “Someone has to lead in climbing out of this mudhole,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “We generally pride ourselves in doing what’s right, not what’s easy,” Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and former Indiana lawmaker, told CNN. “We take our time. We weigh things.”\n \n\n   \n  In another Republican-controlled state, Louisiana lawmakers this week took steps that could give their party an edge next year. Legislators voted to delay the state’s 2026 primary elections by a month to give them more time to draw new congressional lines if the US Supreme Court decides a redistricting case in the state’s favor.\n \n\n   \n    ‘An incredible Pandora’s box’\n \n\n   \n  While Republicans have structural advantages that allow them to rack up more seats through redistricting than Democrats can, Rubashkin of Inside Elections said the final outcome of the ongoing redistricting battle is unclear, particularly if next year becomes a wave election for Democrats, akin to 2018 midterm elections when the party gained more than 40 House seats during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “If the partisan, national environment is favorable enough to one party or the other, you cannot redistrict your way into the majority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, Rubashkin added, the redistricting push now underway likely has changed US politics, by opening “an incredible Pandora’s box … that will persist long after this election cycle. I don’t see what will stop states that have the capacity from simply redrawing every two years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/shutdown-snap-trump-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:12:00-04:00","title":"Trump returns to confront deepening duel of pain as shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As President Donald Trump returns from an Asia tour, the nation faces a deepening government shutdown, now the worst domestic political crisis of his second term.

  \n  President Donald Trump had his fun, with red carpet welcomes, impromptu dances, the  gift of a golden crown  and a yet another  Nobel Peace Prize nomination .\n \n\n   \n  But the trophies from  his Asia tour  won’t count for much when he arrives home Thursday just as the monthlong government shutdown takes its bitterest turn yet amid the worst domestic political crisis of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  His return and a confluence of suddenly harsher  consequences for millions of Americans  mean the next few days may represent the only way out of the increasingly damaging impasse before the run-up to Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pretending that everything is OK,” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their mortgages and other obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/abby-zwerner-teacher-shooting-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:55:00-04:00","title":"Trial Underway in $40 Million Lawsuit Filed by Teacher Shot by 6-Year-Old Student","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A civil trial is underway in a $40 million lawsuit filed by former Virginia elementary teacher Abby Zwerner, who was shot in her classroom by a 6-year-old student in January 2023.

a former Virginia elementary school teacher who was shot in her classroom by a 6-year-old student saw emotional testimony Wednesday from her sister along with descriptions of the injuries.\n \n\n   \n   Abby Zwerner , who taught first grade at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, is suing a former assistant principal for $40 million, saying she ignored multiple warnings the boy had a gun in the hours before the January 2023 shooting. Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest as she sat at a reading table.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the key developments from Day 2 of the trial, which is set to continue Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit accuses former school administrator Ebony Parker of failing to act after four people went to her with  concerns  the student brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s attorney, Diane Toscano, said in opening statements Parker made “bad decisions and choices that day.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker had the authority but failed to search the student, remove him from the classroom and call law enforcement, Toscano added.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting occurred on the first day after the student had returned from a suspension for slamming Zwerner’s phone two days earlier, Toscano said. It sent shock waves through the community and the country, with many wondering  how a child so young could get access to a gun  and shoot his teacher.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner  spent nearly two weeks in the hospital , required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand.\n \n\n   \n  “No one could have imagined that a 6-year old, first-grade student would bring a firearm into a school,” Parker’s attorney, Daniel Hogan, told jurors. “You will be able to judge for yourself whether or not this was foreseeable. That’s the heart of this case.”\n \n\n   \n  Hogan said that decision-making in a public school setting is “cooperative” and “collaborative.” He also warned of hindsight bias and “Monday-morning quarterbacking.”\n \n\n   \n  “The law knows that it is fundamentally unfair to judge another person’s decisions based on stuff that came up after the fact,” Hogan said. “The law requires you to examine people’s decisions at the time they make them.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the district’s superintendent and the school principal.\n \n\n   \n  Parker faces a  separate criminal trial  next month on  eight counts  of felony child neglect — one for “each of the eight bullets that endangered all the students” in Zwerner’s classroom, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Criminal charges against school officials following a school shooting are quite rare, experts say. Each of the counts is punishable by up to five years in prison upon a conviction.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was sentenced to a total of nearly four years in prison for  felony child neglect  and  federal weapons charges .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/national-guard-dc-extension-february-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: National Guard orders in DC extended through February 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, has been extended through February 2026, defying earlier expectations that it would end in November.

They added that McGee had frequently “pushed back” against Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine on issues ranging from Russia and Ukraine to military operations in the Caribbean. The sources noted that McGee was nominated by former President Joe Biden nearly a year ago for a promotion to serve as director of the Joint Staff but was never renominated by the current administration.\n \n\n   \n  McGee’s primary responsibility in the role was to advise Caine on long-term military strategy including weighing the risks of potential actions and planning for crisis contingencies.\n \n\n   \n  “He has had a target on his back for a while now,” one of the sources said of McGee. Two other sources said there were discussions internally as far back as the spring about pushing out McGee.\n \n\n   \n  Caine and Hegseth also got frustrated with McGee at times because they believed he moved too slowly, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some in the Office of the Secretary of Defense saw McGee as too close to the “old guard” of the Pentagon, particularly former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  Gen. Mark Milley  and former Secretary of Defense  Lloyd Austin , one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  McGee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that “General McGee is retiring, and the war department is grateful for his service.” He denied CNN reporting that Hegseth and McGee had clashed.\n \n\n   \n  “Lt Gen. JP McGee will retire after nearly three years of outstanding leadership and service on the Joint Staff. We are grateful for his 35 years of honorable and dedicated service to the Nation,” a Joint Staff spokesperson told CNN. “We owe him a great debt for his service and it is regrettable anonymous sources would put the focus anywhere else.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth has pushed out more than a dozen senior military officials since taking office in January, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown, the Chief of Naval Operations, the directors of the National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, and the top uniformed lawyers for the Army and Air Force.\n \n\n   \n  All were suspected of being insufficiently aligned with Hegseth’s agenda, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senior military officials, including the former director of the Joint Staff Lt. Gen. Doug Sims and the commander of US Southern Command Adm. Alvin Holsey, have been allowed to retire, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Holsey offered to resign amid stark disagreements with Hegseth and Caine over the legality of the US military’s strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean, CNN has reported. Like with McGee, Hegseth had been frustrated that Holsey tended to move too slowly and saw him as an obstacle, according to sources. Holsey announced on October 16 that he would be retiring in December, just one year into the job.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/shutdown-talks-thune-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:17:00-04:00","title":"Rank-and-file senators engage in ‘shadow negotiation’ in search for shutdown end","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late October 2025, a group of rank-and-file Republican and Democratic senators engaged in 'shadow negotiations' behind the scenes to resolve a 29-day government shutdown.

One of their goals is to resolve the impasse on health care and reopen the government for the next few weeks. They are also hoping to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments, including the US Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps, through next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the private conversations that are going on are trying to create like a shadow negotiation, so that we have some clarity about what we need to vote on,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, one of those involved in the conversations, told CNN on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But these senators still face an uphill climb to get their warring parties on the same page. Their task has been made more complicated by GOP leaders’ fierce commitment not to negotiate with Democrats on health care until Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his members agree to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune appeared to suggest on Wednesday that he would have a conversation with those involved in the negotiations. Asked if he would personally engage with centrist Democrats involved in the talks, Thune told CNN: “I think that will happen pretty soon.”\n \n\n   \n  But his office later told CNN that he remains unwilling to discuss any Obamacare policy changes until the government is open. And Thune stressed he could not guarantee any resolution to Democrats: “I’ve offered up a process. I can’t guarantee an outcome or result,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the emerging talks are a fresh sign of optimism inside a gloomy Capitol building. Finally, after weeks of total gridlock with half of Congress not even present in Washington, there appears to be some movement. The push comes as members of both parties brace for worsening effects of the shutdown, including the lapse of food stamps for the first time in the program’s history starting this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds suggested that — if party leaders agreed — the Senate could vote as early as next week on full-year spending bills that would allow Democrats to move on past the current funding fight and pivot to longer-term spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re focused on - Is there a way for our Democratic colleagues to save face and perhaps not vote directly to a continuing resolution?” Rounds said, referring to the same stopgap bill that Democrats have blocked more than a dozen times. Instead, he said, Republicans would put the bipartisan, full-year spending bills on the floor “as a way around the continuing resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once that’s moving, maybe then we’ll look at a continuing resolution,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers have faced increased pressure to reopen the government this week with  crucial safety net programs  – including federal food assistance for more than 40 million people – at risk of shuttering in the coming days. Thune’s remarks come hours after he and numerous other senators voiced a rare sense of optimism that there could be a way out of the 29-day shutdown. Still, neither side has made any commitments publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ticked up significantly and hopefully that’ll be a precursor of things to come,” Thune told reporters earlier in the day when asked about the status of talks with rank-and-file Democrats. “But yeah, there’s a lot of higher level of conversation.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, Thune said, are not involved in the negotiating. Asked whether he thought there would be enough moderate Democrats in the mix to reach a deal that would reopen the government, he expressed optimism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a possibility that could happen. So, let’s just hope that the conversations continue,” he said, noting he’s “being kept briefed and read-into most of those conversations. I’m hoping something here very soon will be fruitful.”\n \n\n   \n  One Democrat involved in the talks, who requested anonymity to speak on the discussions, told CNN the conversations Thune cited are real. The Democrat would not elaborate on whether they were focused solely on resolving the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies or if other matters – such as the White House’s recent moves to flout Congress’ spending power through “rescissions” – were also involved.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the talks could offer a way out of the shutdown, the Democrat would only say: “Maybe.”\n \n\n   \n  One component of the ongoing talks – how to win support in the Senate for full-year appropriations bills that would prevent another shutdown cliff in the coming weeks. Two other Democrats involved in the discussions suggested to CNN that they are interested in those long-term bills as part of an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about whether emerging talks involved full year spending bills, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters said he didn’t “want to get into specifics but clearly that would be nice.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, told CNN that “it’s accurate to say we’re pushing for full-year appropriations bills because that’s what we should be doing,” when asked whether the party was pursuing them as a way out of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, who has been involved in the talks, declined to confirm Thune’s assessment that they are making progress, but said, “I think there have been good discussions. That’s all I’m going to tell you about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and has been perhaps the most vocal Republican calling for bipartisan talks, told reporters Wednesday that she was “encouraged” by the direction of talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there are, have been enough of the pieces that have been talked through that if, if somebody can just diagram out how it all comes together and present that — Yes, I do believe it’s possible to kind of come together quickly,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no great magic in how we get out of this. It’s the same stuff we’ve been talking about for months,” added Murkowski.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, said that he did not think that Republicans had offered anything new in the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  “There have been, there are occasional talks between Democrats and Republicans on this issue, but our Republican colleagues don’t seem to be offering anything different than what their leadership has had so far we hope that will change,” the New York Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t want to pit health care and food. They do, we think you can have both.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/analysis-gaza-ceasefire-israel-strikes-new-normal-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-04:00","title":"Gaza’s new normal is a truce without peace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ceasefire in Gaza, brokered by the United States and effective since October 10, 2025, remains fragile and unstable despite both Hamas and Israel recommitting to it after violent escalations.

\nUpdated: \n        7:00 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Anyone who looked at the situation in Gaza  on Tuesday  might reasonably have concluded that the ceasefire had collapsed.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli forces in Gaza came under grenade and sniper fire in Rafah, according to the military, killing an Israeli soldier. In retaliation, Israel unleashed punishing strikes across Gaza that killed more than 100 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n \n\n   \n  The US-brokered ceasefire looked like it had disintegrated. But by Wednesday morning, both Hamas and Israel had announced they were once again committed to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  It was the second violent escalation since the  ceasefire  took effect on October 10. But, just like the fighting that occurred nine days later, when two Israeli soldiers and at least 36 Palestinians were killed, it was short, ending within a matter of hours.\n \n\n   \n  Gaza’s new normal seems to be a ceasefire that is both fragile and durable. A truce that holds in general but can vanish in an instant, only to be restored within hours or days.\n \n\n   \n  Until the next escalation.\n \n\n   \n  This situation between all-out conflict and a comprehensive peace provides no closure: Palestinians will be in constant fear of the next wave of deadly strikes, while Israel will teeter perpetually on the brink of war.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week the ceasefire was “not going to be a linear journey.” It would have “ups and downs” and “twists and turns,” he said. Vice President JD Vance said yesterday there would be “little skirmishes here and there.” And yet both were optimistic about the ceasefire holding.\n \n\n   \n  The deal was imposed in large part by the sheer willpower of US President Donald Trump, who reined in Israel, while mediators pressured Hamas to accept. It will take continued US interest to keep the deal intact, especially during the next phase, which requires the creation of an international force for Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas, among other difficult tasks.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire’s fragility is a function of the chasm between what the agreement has so far accomplished and what it has yet to achieve. The fighting has largely stopped. Hamas has turned over the living hostages and more than half of the deceased. Israel has pulled back to the yellow line that demarcates the first withdrawal position inside Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But in the current limbo between the nearly complete first phase of the agreement and the far more difficult second phase, which requires a more complete withdrawal and an end to the war, Israeli forces occupy more than half of Gaza’s territory.\n \n\n   \n  According to Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, that territory includes isolated Hamas cells trapped in tunnels and outside the militant organization’s command and control. With limited resources and no connection to Hamas’ remaining leadership, each cell is “a catastrophe in the making,” Shehada says.\n \n\n   \n  “The closer those IDF vehicles come to a tunnel or to a hideout to those disconnected, isolated militants or the more they run out of food, the higher the chances that they emerge in battle with Israeli soldiers,” Shehada told CNN. “They would rather die in combat than die of starvation or wait for the IDF to find them.”\n \n\n   \n  After the first major violation of the ceasefire on October 19, Hamas issued a statement saying that “contact with the remnants of our groups” in areas like Rafah had “been cut off since the resumption of hostilities in March.” It is these “remnants” that Shehada says are ticking “time bombs.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hamas doesn’t even know how many are there that are still alive,” said Shehada.\n \n\n   \n  Israel and Hamas have engaged in short, sharp escalations many times prior to this war. In 2018 and 2019, the two exchanged fire in rounds of hostilities that would frequently end within 48 hours. But now these escalations are almost exclusively in one direction, with Israel unleashing its firepower on Gaza against a depleted Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire started, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the vast majority during two days of escalation on October 19 and 28. Three Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza during the same period.\n \n\n   \n  Yoav Limor, military and defense analyst for the right-wing Israel Hayom newspaper, says more conflict is inevitable, and it will take US involvement to keep the deal from falling apart.\n \n\n   \n  “Hamas will remain Hamas: it will grow stronger and continue to carry out attacks. Anyone who believes it has changed does not understand the movement or the nature of the region,” said Limor. “That is why Washington must push forward and advance the next phase of the ceasefire deal and work to edge Hamas out of power. Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate.”\n \n\n   \n  The US has sent a parade of its top officials to monitor the ceasefire and begin to create the mechanisms needed for the next phase of the deal, including humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of Gaza. It is a tremendous expense of political capital, but it has signaled to Israel – and to the region – that the White House remains engaged as all the details are still being worked out. The US is determined to keep the process moving forward, even if progress is incremental.\n \n\n   \n  In the short-term, Limor said, “it is likely that the ceasefire will hold this familiar patten of violence and response.” Israel is preparing for an election year during which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be wary of resuming a total war. Hamas is also looking for a  hudna , or period of calm, in which it can recuperate and rebuild, he said.\n \n\n   \n  To break this pattern of a ceasefire marred by violent escalations – and prevent the emerging new normal – requires major progress on some of the 20-point plan’s most difficult conditions, including the disarmament of Hamas and creating new governance in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  At a press conference on Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Hamas was willing to cede power in Gaza, even as he acknowledged that Doha was “trying to push them all in order to get to a point where they acknowledge that they need to disarm.”\n \n\n   \n  He said Hamas needs to be ready to move to the next stage of the deal. “We need to make sure the Palestinians are safe and the Israelis are safe … creating a political horizon for the Palestinian people and creating a Palestinian agency that will be able to be the sole holder of arms.”\n \n\n   \n  If that cannot be done, Israelis and Palestinians will remain in limbo, trapped in a short-term truce without peace that offers no long-term prospect for a solution.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/kat-abughazaleh-chicago-ice-protests","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"18:55:00-05:00","title":"Democratic Congressional Candidate Kat Abughazaleh Indicted Over Role in ICE Protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh has been indicted for conspiring to impede a federal ICE agent during a protest in suburban Chicago on September 26, 2025.

DC, were placed on leave after describing the January 6, 2021   attack at the US Capitol as stemming from a “mob of rioters”  in a sentencing memo  Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The two prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, were notified of their suspension hours after they submitted a sentencing request for Taylor Taranto, the person said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump pardoned Taranto for charges related to his participation in January 6, but the Washington man still faces gun charges stemming from his arrest in the summer of 2023, when he was  detained nearby President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, home .\n \n\n   \n  When describing Taranto’s history, prosecutors wrote that, “On January 6, 2021, thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol while a joint session of Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.”\n \n\n   \n  The original sentencing memo, dated Tuesday, was removed from the court docket Wednesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  A  new sentencing memo  was posted by different prosecutors late Wednesday that removed all references to January 6 or the Trump social media post that Taranto reposted, which included an alleged address for President Barack Obama, where Taranto was arrested the next day.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  They asked the judge to sentence him to 27 months behind bars. That same punishment is still being requested by prosecutors in the new memo.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June, 2023 in Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and other’s homes.\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia and White wrote in Tuesday’s memo that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by a federal judge of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  The move to place federal prosecutors on leave follows a list of other firings in US Attorney’s offices.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration fired the top national security prosecutor in the nearby US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia,  Michael Ben’Ary,  earlier this month after a social media post by a  right-wing activist and writer falsely tied  him to  the case of FBI Director James Comey .\n \n\n   \n  The former US Attorney of the same Eastern District, Erik Siebert, resigned in September after mounting pressure to bring charges against  New York Attorney General Letitia James , and was replaced by a White House advisor who lacked prosecutorial experience.\n \n\n   \n  Another prosecutor in the Alexandria, Beth Yusi, was  dismissed earlier this month  after drafting a memo outlining why prosecutors believed there was not enough evidence to bring charges against James. People familiar with her termination told CNN she was fired after mishandling FBI documents containing James’s personal information.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/china/zion-church-crackdown-ezra-jin-trump-xi-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-20:00","title":"Grace Drexel Hopes Trump Can Free Her Dad Detained in China for Leading a Church","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Grace Drexel, daughter of Pastor Ezra Jin Mingri, is advocating for U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene during his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to secure the release of her father and other members of the underground Zion Church, which was targeted in a major crackdown in October 2025.

China for leading a church. She hopes Trump can free him in meeting with Xi \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, and CNN staff\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Grace Jin Drexel couldn’t contact her father on October 10, she tried not to panic. She had just heard that one of the pastors of his underground Christian church in  China  had been detained by authorities; maybe he was busy sorting out the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Then her fears were confirmed. Her father, Ezra Jin Mingri, and dozens of other members of Zion Church had been swept up in a mass crackdown across various congregations and Chinese cities – the largest suppression since  a similar wave of arrests in 2018. \n \n\n   \n  Chinese authorities have long seen Christianity as an unwelcome foreign influence and a threat to government control, experts say – and this crackdown sends a particularly stark message, targeting a well-known church that has been shut down once before.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family, all American citizens living in the US while Jin resided in China, hope a major diplomatic meeting this week might change that.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, US President Donald Trump is  meeting  Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. While trade is expected to dominate the conversation, there are growing calls for Trump to raise the issue of the crackdown and Jin’s detention.\n \n\n   \n  The summit presents “a very unique timing,” said Drexel, who works as a staffer in the US Senate. “We think that the Trump administration’s prioritization of Americans in this scenario also could be helpful for my father as well, to bring a family member of an American citizen home to be with us in the US and safe,” she told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not publicly commented on the issue, and it’s not clear whether it will be on the agenda on Thursday. Tensions remain high between the US and China, which reached a  framework agreement on trade  this week ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, after a series of escalatory tariffs imposed on each other.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family see this as a rare window of opportunity before Jin’s potential indictment for illegally disseminating information online – which, Drexel said, would make his release much harder to negotiate.\n \n\n   \n  She and Jin have some powerful backers, including Secretary of State  Marco Rubio  and members of the  Congressional-Executive Commission on China. \n \n\n   \n  “We must make it clear to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) that the persecution of Christians and other people of faith must stop, and that the United States will use every tool, diplomatic and economic, to hold Chinese Communist officials accountable,” Sen. Ted Cruz said in a video shared by the Hudson Institute think tank, where Drexel’s husband works as a fellow.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, when asked about Rubio’s call for the pastors’ release, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “The Chinese government manages religious affairs in accordance with the law, protecting citizens’ freedom of religious belief and normal religious activities. We firmly oppose the US interfering in China’s internal affairs under the guise of so-called religious issues.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the foreign affairs office in Beihai, where Jin is detained, and to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau for comment.\n \n\n   \n    A string of crackdowns\n \n\n   \n  This crackdown is the latest in a long history of religious suppression in China. Religious practice is legal but tightly controlled and surveilled by the government, which registers “official” state-sanctioned churches.\n \n\n   \n  The government only recognizes five faiths: Chinese Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism and Taoism. Other local spiritual and religious movements have been subject to harsh crackdowns over the years. But that hasn’t stopped communities from creating their own underground, non-registered churches known as “house churches.”\n \n\n   \n  One 44-year-old Christian in Beijing told CNN she’d attended several “house churches,” and had seen plainclothes police officers entering and asking everyone to register themselves.\n \n\n   \n  During previous crackdowns, “when brothers and sisters were arrested, we would all donate money and send someone to visit them in jail and buy them food and clothes,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Zion Church is one such “house church” that the 44-year-old recalled attending in previous years. Jin founded Zion Church in 2007 in Beijing while his family was still living in China; it gradually became one of the largest churches in Beijing, Drexel said.\n \n\n   \n  By 2011, Jin was speaking out about crackdowns on other congregations, in the hopes underground churches might become legally recognized. “We are very aware of what we are doing,” he said in 2011, when he granted CNN rare access to film inside his church. “And we are ready to pay the price.”\n \n\n   \n  That price came in 2018. Drexel described a “pressure campaign” that year, with the government installing facial recognition cameras in the lobby of the church’s building after Jin refused to install them inside the church itself.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to appease the authorities, Jin and his family moved to the US – and when the harassment toward church members in Beijing continued, Jin decided to return to China later that year while his family stayed behind.\n \n\n   \n  That was the last time most of the family saw Jin. The crackdown came soon after; Zion Church was shut down, and Jin was barred from leaving the country. In Chengdu, more than 100 worshipers from a different church were detained, and its pastor, Wang Yi, was jailed for nine years for “inciting subversion of state power.”\n \n\n   \n  Drexel visited her father in 2019 – and she, too, was prevented from leaving China for 11 months, derailing her plans to attend law school. She was eventually allowed to return to the US but hasn’t seen her father since.\n \n\n   \n  After 2018, Jin transformed Zion Church into a semi-virtual network, uploading sermons online and encouraging members around the country to gather and watch sessions together. When the pandemic hit, Zion was quick to adapt to Zoom – and the church’s membership exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the CCP’s own policy of locking people up inside their house, and there was nothing to do for people, a lot of people went to church (online), and it was the only place where you could interact with people,” Drexel said, referring to China’s stringent zero-Covid and lockdown policies at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The church became a national organization that now reaches 10,000 people each day, Drexel said. But there were also signs that it was once again under threat; authorities were watching Jin’s movements closely, and even blocked him from traveling to other cities within China. Church members reported an uptick in harassment and intimidation.\n \n\n   \n  A fellow Zion pastor asked Jin earlier this month: “What if this is the big thing, that they arrest everyone? What would happen?”\n \n\n   \n  “My dad did not hesitate one moment, and was not scared,” Drexel said. “He just said immediately, ‘Hallelujah, the gospel will spread further.’”\n \n\n   \n    Why now?\n \n\n   \n  The Zion pastors and church leaders arrested in October are now being kept in two detention centers in the southern city of Beihai, according to Drexel.\n \n\n   \n  Though a few have since been released, close to two dozen remain detained, she said.\n \n\n   \n  All the detainees are “innocent Christians,” the church said in a statement on October 12. “Their only ‘offense’ is worshiping God peacefully, preaching the Gospel faithfully, shepherding their flock, and serving their neighbors. These acts of faith are protected under both the Constitution of China and international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t just happen to Zion, said Drexel – other underground churches have been targeted, too, including Bitter Winter and Early Rain Covenant Church.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees’ families are deeply worried, she said. Some are elderly with health problems, while others have young children at home. Her father, Jin, has severe diabetes – and while he’s now being provided generic medication, he hasn’t been able to receive the prescription issued by his doctor, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And in a rare development that Drexel credits to the international attention on their case, most of the detainees have been granted legal representation.\n \n\n   \n  Jin’s lawyer said he appears in “relatively good spirits,” said Drexel – he even joked that the bad food in detention was good for controlling his diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  But the stakes are high under China’s opaque judicial system, which legal observers say has a conviction rate around 99%. Wang Yi, the pastor arrested in 2018, is still in prison today.\n \n\n   \n  Drexel is still trying to understand why the CCP under Xi – whose grip on power has tightened since 2018 – is so threatened by “this small group of Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  One theory, she said, points to China’s ongoing economic hardships. Wary of growing public discontent, the government may “try to clamp down on everything, including freedom of speech and other civil and society organizations,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Fenggang Yang, a professor of sociology and director of the Center on Religion and the Global East at Purdue University, partially agreed. While he’s not convinced it has to do with the current economic situation, he emphasized that the churches pose a deep ideological threat to Xi, who has tightened religious regulations since taking office and increasingly emphasized the need to “Sinicize” religions.\n \n\n   \n  “The Chinese authorities always considered Christianity as one of the institutions that pose the greatest challenge – for (starting a) color revolution, for changing people’s attitudes towards the government,” Yang said.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees don’t seem to be a particularly high priority for either Trump or Xi ahead of their meeting, he added.\n \n\n   \n  As the world watches for signs of easing US-China tensions out of their leaders’ high-stakes talks, Drexel has a much simpler wish: she just wants her dad back.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to emphasize that my dad went back to China because he had a deep love for China and Chinese people,” she said. “We want to be able to keep being faithful to our God, as well as to serve our community and serve China.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/investigation-into-crash-of-small-jet-owned-by-motley-crues-vince-neil-prompts-urgent-ntsb-recommendation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"18:04:00Z","title":"Investigation into crash of small jet owned by Mötley Crüe’s Vince Neil prompts urgent NTSB recommendation","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The crash of Vince Neil’s Learjet 35A at Scottsdale Airport in February 2025, which killed the captain and injured several others, revealed a critical defect in the landing gear—specifically, a pin not being fully inserted during installation.

at this point that congressional Republicans are loathe to vote against President Donald Trump. Fealty to Trump has become the animating principle in the party – so much so that GOP lawmakers have willfully relegated themselves to second-class citizens in Washington as they’ve steadily ceded their powers and prerogatives to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But all of that makes it even more striking when they decide to actually stand up for themselves, for once.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s now happened twice just this week.\n \n\n   \n  Enough Senate Republicans voted against Trump’s tariffs on Brazil and Canada so that a majority of the chamber has now expressed its opposition to both. They did so even after the White House  mobilized Vice President JD Vance  to try to prevent the rebukes.\n \n\n   \n  So when have Republicans in Congress actually been willing to vote against Trump? It’s most often happened with foreign policy.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s run through the big examples.\n \n\n   \n    The tariffs\n \n\n   \n  These were not large-scale GOP defections, but they were large enough that they enabled the  GOP-controlled chamber to rebuke the president.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, four GOP senators – Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – voted to terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration to impose tariffs on Canada. That meant the measure passed with 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined them to  make it five Republicans voting against Trump’s tariffs on Brazil . The overall vote was 52-48, against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  (Tillis has raised concerns about Trump’s tariffs before. He said he voted against the Brazil tariffs, specifically, because they appeared to be related to Brazil’s prosecution of Trump-allied former President Jair Bolsonaro rather than actual trade disputes.)\n \n\n   \n  Then on Wednesday, the same four GOP senators voted against the Canada tariffs again.\n \n\n   \n  It’s highly unlikely the House will ever vote on terminating these tariffs. In fact, the GOP-controlled House actually took action earlier this year  to prevent such votes . And these senators could go much further if they wanted to in trying to force the issue.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s significant that a majority of the GOP-controlled Senate is rebuking Trump on his tariffs, and it certainly undercuts his supposed mandate on the issue.\n \n\n   \n    2017: The Russia sanctions\n \n\n   \n  This was perhaps the first big congressional rebuke of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  During the early portions of the Russia investigation, Congress  passed new sanctions against Russia  that the Trump White House explicitly opposed. The legislation  also gave Congress additional powers to block Trump from easing existing Russia sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The measure passed almost unanimously in both GOP-controlled chambers – 98-2 in the Senate and 419-3 in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ultimately signed the legislation – likely knowing Congress could simply override his veto – while claiming it contained “a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.”\n \n\n   \n    2018: Ending US involvement in Yemen\n \n\n   \n  The Senate  voted 56-41  in late 2018 to end US support for the Saudi Arabia-led war in Yemen. The move came shortly after Trump signaled a solid relationship with the Saudis despite their murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Seven Senate Republicans voted in favor.\n \n\n   \n    2019: No NATO withdrawal\n \n\n   \n  With Trump occasionally flirting with a withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in his first term, the Democratic-controlled House in early 2019 passed legislation to make that more difficult.\n \n\n   \n  It  voted 357-22  to prohibit funds from being used to withdraw from the alliance.\n \n\n   \n    2019: The Syria rebukes\n \n\n   \n  Few Trump moves have alienated congressional Republicans likes the ones he made in Syria in 2019. And they led to separate rebukes in both the Senate and the House.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump moved to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan, the GOP-controlled Senate passed nonbinding amendments expressing its opposition. One amendment stated that the move “could allow terrorists to regroup, destabilize critical regions, and create vacuums that could be filled by Iran or Russia to the detriment of United States interests and our allies.”\n \n\n   \n  It passed 68-23. A similar amendment later passed 70-26, with 43 Senate Republicans voting in favor.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, then the second-ranking Senate Republican, said lawmakers felt the need to vote that way after the White House disregarded their privately expressed concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the year, Trump’s controversial decision to withdraw from northeast Syria led many Republicans to rebuke him for effectively allowing Turkey to slaughter US-allied Kurdish forces there.\n \n\n   \n  The Democrat-led House  voted 354-60  for a resolution stating that the withdrawal was “beneficial to adversaries of the United States government, including Syria, Iran, and Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  House Republicans voted for it more than 2-to-1, with 129 votes in favor and 60 against.\n \n\n   \n    2019: Other Middle East rebukes\n \n\n   \n  Congress also rebuked Trump’s posture  on other Middle East issues , including arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  That legislation passed in both chambers with the support of 16 House Republicans and seven Senate Republicans, before  Trump ultimately vetoed it .\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Jan. 6 impeachment\n \n\n   \n  It seems like a long time ago now, and the votes came at a time when many Republicans probably thought Trump’s political career was over.\n \n\n   \n  But the votes to impeach and convict Trump after January 6, 2021, remain some of the most historic bipartisan rebukes of a president ever.\n \n\n   \n  The 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach made that the  most bipartisan impeachment vote ever . And the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict was by far the  most members of a president’s party to ever vote that way .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/science/antarctica-weddell-sea-fish-nests","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"17:42:00Z","title":"Antarctic expedition to find Endurance shipwreck made surprising seafloor discovery","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a 2019 expedition to the Weddell Sea in Antarctica, researchers aboard the SA Agulhas II vessel discovered striking geometric patterns in fish nests formed by yellowfin notie (Lindbergichthys nudifrons) on the exposed seafloor.

 5:42 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  During an expedition to search for a famed shipwreck, researchers discovered something unexpected: striking geometric patterns on the floor of Antarctica’s western Weddell Sea created by fish.\n \n\n   \n  The seafloor had once been obscured beneath a thick ice shelf, but that changed in July 2017 when the massive  A68 iceberg  calved from the Larsen C Ice Shelf. The iceberg measured 2,239 square miles (5,800 square kilometers) — about the size of Delaware.\n \n\n   \n  Seizing an opportunity to study the previously hidden seafloor, researchers organized the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019 with two goals in mind: exploring the biology of the western Weddell Sea and searching for the wreckage of the HMS Endurance, which became trapped and  ultimately ripped apart by ice  in 1915.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers set sail in January 2019 for a 49-day expedition aboard the South African polar research vessel SA Agulhas II. Ironically, the expedition experienced extreme sea ice conditions similar to what Endurance faced more than a century earlier, preventing the team from conducting a search for the wreck.\n \n\n   \n  “The sea ice in particular was a challenge as at the time there was a bottleneck and a build of sea ice around that area — we were heading directly towards this, playing chicken with icebergs as we went,” said Dr. Michelle Taylor, senior lecturer in the School of Life Sciences at the UK’s University of Essex. Taylor is the coauthor of a new study published Wednesday in the journal  Frontiers  about what the expedition uncovered.\n \n\n   \n  Despite not finding the wreckage, the expedition captured invaluable underwater footage of marine life that inhabits the frigid depths of the Weddell Sea. The research vessel’s remotely operated underwater vehicle, nicknamed Lassie, spied a series of nests arranged in distinct shapes sprawling across the seafloor.\n \n\n   \n  “Over a thousand maintained nests within the areas studied goes to show that exploration of our world is still underway, with constant new findings,” lead study author Russ Connelly, postgraduate researcher in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Essex, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The discovery  showcases the diversity of life that exists in a place experiencing rapid climate change — which is why scientists are petitioning for the Weddell Sea’s fragile ecosystem to be protected by law.\n \n\n   \n  (The HMS Endurance shipwreck was ultimately  discovered during a 2022 expedition .)\n \n\n   \n    A geometric neighborhood\n \n\n   \n  As Lassie passed over the Weddell seafloor, large dimples appeared in the sand. The round spots seemed neat compared with their surroundings, clear of the layers of decomposing plankton spotted elsewhere on the seafloor.\n \n\n   \n  “This was the first time we have seen this area of seafloor, so there is always a realm of mystery to be expected,” Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  When scientists looked at the video footage that Lassie took, they noticed fish and fish larvae within the dimples. A closer look revealed the fish to be a species of rockcod called Lindbergichthys nudifrons, otherwise known as the yellowfin notie. The fish are found from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia in the Atlantic section of the  Southern Ocean , Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  “These species are extremophiles; they thrive in high-pressure and cold-water environments,” Connelly said. “They build small, circular nests in the fine sediment, and then the males guard the eggs for around 4 months. Their main threat comes from predators on the seafloor, like brittle stars and predatory worms, which try to eat the eggs.”\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also noticed that the 1,036 active nests, located across five sites on the seafloor, showcased six different patterns.\n \n\n   \n  There were clusters of nests  found close together or overlapping, and crescents of nests arranged in a curved line, like a crescent moon. Other nests were evenly spaced in a straight line, arranged in an oval shape with even spacing around the perimeter or following a distinct U-shape.\n \n\n   \n  There were also individual, isolated nests, which were typically larger than any that were arranged in a specific shape, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The finding marks the first time that complex patterns have been observed in yellowfin notie nests.\n \n\n   \n  Clusters were the most common arrangement, representing more than 42% of the nests, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  The team believes the patterns represent a strategy for survival against predators. For those living in cluster patterns, the fish at the center receive the most protection from predators. The researchers think this arrangement represents the  “selfish herd” theory , “where individuals reduce their domain of danger by putting other individuals between themselves and an approaching predator,” the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  Previous research has shown that yellowfin notie males will defend territories up to 9.8 inches (25 centimeters) away from their nests, which would mean their neighbors are also protected within the cluster arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  “In the absence of refuge, they can group together to form greater levels of protection,” Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  The fish are likely protecting against ribbon worms, or Parborlasia corrugata, a type of nemertean, observed living in the vicinity. The ribbon worms detect chemical signals from their environment to find food.\n \n\n   \n  “(The clusters) could create a confusing sensory environment for the nemertean, making it more difficult to detect and target a single nest, a crucial adaptive strategy during the long incubation period (for the eggs),” the authors wrote in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the isolated nests on the outskirts of the fish communities are thought to belong to larger, stronger members of the species capable of defending their own nests.\n \n\n   \n    Protecting a vulnerable place\n \n\n   \n  The ice-covered Weddell Sea is a challenging place to study, but it’s home to a diverse community of fish, brittle stars, sponges, cephalopods, marine birds and mammals.\n \n\n   \n  Another expedition to the Weddell Sea in 2021 observed a vast colony of icefish, or Neopagetopsis ionah, with  see-through skulls and transparent blood .\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Autun Purser, a senior researcher in deep-sea ecology and technology at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, led the 2021 icefish research. While he did not participate in the new research, Purser said he believes both studies benefited from underwater camera systems that can spot patterns within extensive fish nests.\n \n\n   \n  “With mobile camera systems, we can now investigate larger structures and areas of seafloor in studies than was possible in the past,” Purser said.\n \n\n   \n  Return trips to the Weddell Sea have confirmed that such nesting behaviors are more abundant within the icy ecosystem, he added.\n \n\n   \n  He also said he suspects that species within the environment, such as the icefish and the yellowfin notie, benefit from rocks dropped by icebergs as they drift and melt. In the new study, the authors noted that 14.9% of the active nests had pebbles within or around them.\n \n\n   \n  “(The rocks) are ideal to lay eggs on as they allow good oxygenation of the eggs, helping to prevent rotting on the seafloor, whilst also providing a barrier to animals living within the muds to eating the eggs,” Purser noted. “The soft sediments make a ridge wall around these eggs, furthering defense. … It is just an idea, but I like it.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors believe the new research provides crucial evidence of breeding habitats that strengthens the idea of the  Weddell Sea Marine Protected Area , proposed by the  Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources .\n \n\n   \n  “If successfully designated as (a marine protected area), it would mean these vulnerable marine ecosystems are protected,” Connelly said. “It is incredibly important to explore and study these unique environments before we lose something we never knew we had.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/morocco-charged-over-2400-gen-z-protests-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:45:00Z","title":"Morocco charges more than 2,400 people over Gen Z protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Morocco has launched a sweeping crackdown, charging over 2,400 people in connection with youth-led Gen Z 212 protests, which began as a response to perceived government neglect of public services in favor of hosting sporting events.

FDA to streamline approvals for generic biological drugs in latest move targeting health costs \n       \n  By Deidre McPhillips, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:53 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Food and Drug Administration will take steps to streamline the development of generic versions of complex biological drugs, the agency announced Wednesday. The changes are meant to accelerate approvals of cheaper alternatives to medications that treat a wide range of illnesses, leading to increased market competition and lower drug costs for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Biologic drugs are developed using living sources such as bacteria, yeast and animal cells, which inherently creates  more variation  and makes manufacturing more complex than for chemically derived drugs. Biologics have a special pathway to FDA approval, and  biosimilars  — alternatives to the brand name products — have long been treated differently than other generic drugs.\n \n\n   \n  As part of Wednesday’s announcement, the FDA released new  draft guidance  that proposes allowing companies to scale back on the studies and trials needed to prove that a biosimilar product is similar enough to an existing FDA-approved product.\n \n\n   \n  “Biosimilars are often far more affordable to patients and have the promise to significantly lower health care costs in America,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a statement. “By streamlining the biosimilar development process and helping advance interchangeability, we can achieve massive cost reductions for advanced treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and rare disorders affecting millions of Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Biologic medications account for just 5% of prescriptions in the US but more than half of total drug spending, according to the FDA. The agency has  approved only 76 biosimilars  as of early October, it says, and only about 1 in 10 biologic drugs that will lose patent protection in the next decade currently has a biosimilar in development.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed changes will help drug companies cut the time needed to bring a biosimilar to market in half and can slash development costs by $100 million, Makary said at a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “The fastest-growing area of health care spending in the United States is drug spending, and the fastest area of drug spending increases is with this new class of medicines called biologics,” he said. “Lower prices for drug development means lower R&D costs and lower drug prices for everyday Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  The first biosimilar approval in the US happened in 2015. In analyzing data from the decade since, the FDA says that clinical efficacy studies that directly compare a biosimilar to its reference product to confirm that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy “add little scientific value compared with analytical testing.”\n \n\n   \n  The new guidance “reduces this unnecessary resource-intensive requirement for developers to conduct comparative human clinical studies,” which can take years and cost tens of millions of dollars, the agency said. Instead, it allows drug developers “to rely instead on analytical testing to demonstrate product differences.”\n \n\n   \n  Humira is an injectable biologic drug used to treat several autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, and has been one of the top-selling medications since it was approved by the FDA in 2002. Ten biosimilars for Humira have been approved since 2016, but the first one just became available in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “The fundamental problem in health care is that we have non-competitive markets,” Makary said. “When you have that gap, it allows a longer period of no competition. So we want to see more competition, and we want to see more innovation.”\n \n\n   \n  In June, Truveta Research analyzed prescription trends for nearly 67,000 people taking Humira. It found that between January 2023 and April 2025, about 13% of them had evidence of switching to a biosimilar. But among those who switched, about 13% had evidence of switching back to Humira.\n \n\n   \n  “This means for every 100 people on bio-originator Humira, 13 switched to a biosimilar, and 2 switched to a biosimilar and then switched back to bio-originator Humira,” Truveta wrote in a  research blog post. \n \n\n   \n  The switch to biosimilars “may reflect changes in insurer policies, growing trust among providers and patients in biosimilars, or broader shifts in the drug market,” Truveta researchers wrote, but “initial switches may not always be sustained despite lower cost.”\n \n\n   \n  “Notably, nearly 40% of patients who returned to bio-originator Humira did so within 30 days of initiating a biosimilar, suggesting early dissatisfaction [or] adverse reactions. Given that many patients switched back before completing a typical Humira dispense, this pattern may also reflect fear or uncertainty about switching to a biosimilar,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Biosimilars are not exact copies of reference drugs like other generic drugs, and there’s an added layer of approval needed for a biosimilar to be considered “interchangeable” — a classification that allows pharmacists to substitute it without consulting a prescriber.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said Wednesday that it also plans to remove regulatory barriers — generally recommending against “switching studies” — required for biosimilars to receive this classification.\n \n\n   \n  “Science continues to evolve, and the FDA remains committed to advancing common-sense policies that further promote efficient and effective biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar development, without compromising safety and effectiveness,” Dr. George Tidmarsh, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA’s new guidance for biosimilars could start to make an impact quickly, said John Murphy, president and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group for generic and biosimilar drugmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you will start to see clinical development and investment capital allocation decisions happen fairly quickly,” he said. Drug development will still take time, but there could be meaningful signals of change in pipeline strategies made within the next three to six months.\n \n\n   \n  Lower costs for biosimilar development could also encourage drugmakers to broaden their scope to include biologic products with smaller patient markets, Murphy said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, experts say there are additional challenges to ensure that insurance plans and other health care economics allow for investment into biosimilars and create competition as intended.\n \n\n   \n  “We welcome the administration’s focus on increasing biosimilar access and affordability,” Alex Schriver, senior vice president of public affairs for PhRMA, a trade group representing pharmaceutical companies, said in a statement. “Policymakers must fix the misaligned incentives and business practices by middlemen who block biosimilars and profit off medicines at the expense of patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement is among several steps by the Trump administration to lower drug costs, including an executive order calling for drugmakers to offer drugs to US patients with the lowest, or “ Most Favored Nation ,” price and the creation of a “ TrumpRx ” direct-to-consumer website for certain drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said in a  fact sheet  that costly drugs can lead to people skipping doses and abandoning treatment, and many people face insurance coverage gaps and high deductibles.\n \n\n   \n  “With today’s action, the FDA aims to help more companies bring affordable, high-quality biosimilars to market and reduce costs for the American people,” the agency said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/economy/fed-october-rate-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00-04:00","title":"Fed Chair Powell Says Don’t Count on December Rate Cut Amid Data Gaps and Tariff Inflation Concerns","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to a range of 3.75%–4% in October 2025, marking the second rate cut this year, amid concerns about a weak job market and inflation.

one from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who backed a larger, half-point cut; and another from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.\n \n\n   \n  It is the first time since 2019 that there were dueling dissents — both calling for easier and tighter policy — underscoring the heated debate among officials over how President Donald Trump’s sweeping policies on trade, immigration and spending are affecting the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  To make matters more complicated, it was also the first time officials have set monetary policy while lacking an entire month of crucial government employment figures in the modern era.\n \n\n   \n  Central bankers began to lower rates last month after data through August showed employers were adding jobs at the weakest pace since 2010. Major companies such as Amazon and Target have recently announced tens of thousands of layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The problem: A prolonged government shutdown could stand in the way of further rate cuts, especially with some officials such as Schmid concerned about persistent inflation pressures in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n    Powell on the Fed flying blind\n \n\n   \n  Powell made it clear that the Fed doesn’t have the full picture of the economy’s health without government data.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s latest policy statement noted that “more recent indicators” were “consistent” with earlier data, before the shutdown, that showed weak hiring and slightly higher unemployment.  Powell said as much when taking reporters’ questions.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s just no story over the last four weeks, it’s kind of stable,” he said. “You don’t see anything that says that the job market, or really any part of the economy, is making a significant deterioration.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from payroll software provider ADP released this week showed that hiring picked up in September, but remained weak. And while there have been prominent layoff announcements in recent weeks, that doesn’t immediately translate to higher unemployment. Workers who’ve been laid off sometimes receive generous severance packages.\n \n\n   \n  Powell mentioned that private data cannot replace government figures, which are widely known as the “gold standard” of measuring the world’s largest economy. And the persistent absence of those figures could put future rate cuts at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n    Powell on the lingering question of tariff inflation\n \n\n   \n  The inflation situation also remains murky, Powell said.\n \n\n   \n  So far, inflation hasn’t surged due to new tariffs that have gone into effect, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, largely thanks to businesses managing higher costs without passing the buck to consumers.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed chief said that officials expect “that there will be some additional increased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the production chain and, finally, get to consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  Economists widely expect tariff inflation to pick up as well, especially if Trump makes good on his recent tariff threats.\n \n\n   \n  The September CPI, which was released last week despite the shutdown, for Social Security’s cost-of-living adjustment, was cooler than economists had predicted, but it showed persistent price pressures that could worsen because of Trump’s tariffs. Trump is meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping late Wednesday US time for a wide-ranging discussion in South Korea, which will likely include a potential US-China trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  Powell reiterated that there’s a “reasonable” expectation that tariff inflation may be short lived, which helped pave the way for September’s rate cut. But that would also remain unclear if the October CPI, which is scheduled for November 13, isn’t released because the shutdown persisted. Fed officials normally look to the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, widely known as their preferred inflation measure, but that figure also hasn’t been released due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Powell said once the tariffs have kicked in, the hope is that “they stop generating inflation,” reflecting a one-off effect.\n \n\n   \n  “This is how we believe and hope that it will work out,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate decision, policymakers announced the end of a three-year process to shrink the size of their enormous portfolio by December 1.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s portfolio, or balance sheet, reached about $9 trillion in mid-2022, but is now around $6.6 trillion after a careful effort to reverse the stimulus it introduced into the economy during the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic.

contributed to him having “claustrophobia for several years.”\n \n\n   \n  In order to get a mold of Nealon’s face, the makeup artists had to cover him in thick plaster that left him unable to breathe through anything other than two straws that were stuck into his nostrils. He called it a “life mask… or a death mask.”\n \n\n   \n  “I never thought it’d be a problem. And (then) it starts to get warm. And it’s hardening and you’re thinking, ‘Oh my God, all that’s open is my nostrils.

I started getting it more and more,” he explained. “It became almost agoraphobic (for me).

If I need to get home – it’s so backed up!” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The “Weeds” actor then explained that he went on to work through his issues over the course of a couple of years, and that “it doesn’t bother me anymore.”\n \n\n   \n  Nealon was last seen on screen in “ Happy Gilmore 2 .” He’s currently on a standup comedy tour.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/sonya-massey-verdict-deputy-guilty","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:40:00Z","title":"Illinois Deputy Found Guilty of Murder in the Shooting of Sonya Massey, a Black Woman Who Called 911 Asking for Help","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Illinois sheriff’s deputy, Sean Grayson, was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey, a Black woman who called 911 to report a suspected prowler.

    \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A jury on Wednesday convicted an Illinois sheriff’s deputy of second-degree murder, a lesser charge, in the shooting death of  Sonya Massey , a Black woman who called 911 to report a suspected prowler.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Grayson could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison or even probation. The jury did not convict him of first-degree murder, a crime that carries a sentence of 45 years to life.\n \n\n   \n  “While we believe Grayson’s actions deserved a first-degree conviction, today’s verdict is still a measure of justice for Sonya Massey,” Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said after the seven-day trial.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and another deputy arrived at Massey’s home in Springfield, Illinois, early on the morning of July 6, 2024, after she reported a prowler. He  shot the 36-year-old woman  after confronting her about how she was handling a pot of hot water she had removed from her stove.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and his attorneys argued that he feared Massey would scald him with the hot water.\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of  Black people in their homes , and prompted a change in  Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, 31, was charged with first-degree murder, but the jury was given the option of considering second-degree murder, which can apply when a defendant faces a “serious provocation” or believes their action is justified even if that belief is unreasonable. He is scheduled to be sentenced on January 29.\n \n\n   \n  State’s Attorney John Milhiser declined to comment as he left the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n   Body camera video  recorded by the other Sangamon County Sheriff’s deputy on the scene that morning, Dawson Farley, was a key part of the prosecution’s case. It showed Massey, who struggled with mental health issues, telling the officers, “Don’t hurt me,” and repeating, “Please God.”\n \n\n   \n  When the deputies entered the house, Grayson saw the pot on the stove and ordered Massey to move it. Massey jumped up to retrieve the pot and she and Grayson joked about how he said he was backing off from the “hot, steaming water.” Massey then replied, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Grayson and Farley drew their pistols and yelled at Massey to put the pot down. Grayson told investigators he thought her  “rebuke” meant she intended to kill him  and, in the following commotion, fired three shots, striking Massey just below the eye.\n \n\n   \n  Farley testified that Massey didn’t say or do anything that  caused him to view her as a threat . But under cross-examination, he acknowledged that he initially reported to investigators that he feared for his safety because of the hot water. Farley did not fire his weapon and was not charged.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, who was subsequently fired, testified in his own defense and was the first witness called by his attorneys. He told jurors he noticed the bottom of the pot was red and he believed Massey planned to throw the water at him. He said Massey’s words felt like a threat and that he drew his gun because officers are trained to use force to get compliance.\n \n\n   \n  “She done. You can go get it, but that’s a head shot,” Grayson told Farley after the shooting. “There’s nothing you can do, man.”\n \n\n   \n  Grayson relented moments later and went to get his medical kit while Farley found dish towels to apply pressure to the head wound. When Grayson returned, Farley told him his help wasn’t necessary, so he threw his kit on the floor and said, “I’m not even gonna waste my med stuff then.”\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s death also forced the early retirement of the sheriff who hired Grayson and generated a  U.S. Justice Department inquiry . The federal probe was resolved with Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department’s agreement to fortify training, particularly de-escalation practices; develop a program in which mental health professionals can respond to emergency calls; and to generate data on use-of-force incidents.\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s family settled a lawsuit against the county for  $10 million  and state lawmakers changed  Illinois law to require fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/supreme-court-chicago-national-guard-trump-briefs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:50:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Wants More Time and Information Before Deciding if Trump Can Send National Guard to Chicago","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has requested additional briefing and information before ruling on whether President Donald Trump can legally deploy the National Guard to Chicago to protect federal property and officers, specifically in response to protests at an ICE facility.

Instead, the justices appear to be debating one of the administration’s more nuanced justifications for the deployment.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we can’t know for sure, the order certainly seems like a bad sign for President Trump,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “There would be no need for the Supreme Court to ask the parties to address this question if five justices had already agreed to vote for the federal government on one of the other two possible grounds.”\n \n\n   \n  The order comes as multiple courts have been reviewing deployments to other cities – most notably, Portland, Oregon. In that case, the full 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said this week that it will re-review a decision in Trump’s favor.\n \n\n   \n  The call for additional written arguments is almost certainly a response to a  brief submitted  in the case by a Georgetown University Law Center professor, Martin Lederman, who suggested the law Trump is relying on to deploy the Guard to the Chicago area doesn’t apply to civilian law enforcement agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Rather, Lederman argued, the National Guard can only be called forth under that law to augment regular military forces. In its order Wednesday, the Supreme Court asked the Department of Justice and officials in Illinois to address that very issue in a series of new briefs due through mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has argued that calling up the guard is necessary to confront protesters at an ICE facility outside Chicago that he has claimed are engaged in “coordinated, violent opposition to the enforcement of federal law.” He has relied on a federal law that allows a president to take that action if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the litigation, Trump has argued that the protestors are impeding ICE operations. Therefore, he has claimed, ICE has been unable to execute federal immigration laws.\n \n\n   \n  But Lederman dropped a new twist into the case with a brief earlier this month: When the law refers to “regular forces,” he said, it meant the regular military, not civilian law enforcement agencies like ICE.\n \n\n   \n  “There can hardly be any question that the term ‘the regular forces’ in the 1908 Act…referred to the standing, professional military forces, who were commonly known as ‘Regulars,’” Lederman wrote. “The effect of the law was to prescribe the National Guard as the ‘second line of defense, as a supplement to the regular army.’”\n \n\n   \n  Now, both the Trump administration and local officials in Illinois will file a series of briefs debating that issue.\n \n\n   \n  In the Chicago case, Trump federalized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard earlier this month to “protect officers and federal property” outside of Chicago. Another 400 federalized members of the Texas National Guard were also deployed to the state. The administration said those guard members would serve “solely in a protective capacity” and would not engage in law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812.\n \n\n   \n   The Supreme Court rejected Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/safety-net-programs-at-risk-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:39:00-04:00","title":"These four crucial safety net programs are in danger as the government shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing government shutdown, which began on October 1, 2025, is threatening several key U.S. social safety net programs, including SNAP (food stamps), Head Start, LIHEAP (home energy assistance), and WIC.

The two sides  continue to throw barbs  at one another, while a growing number of their constituents panic over losing their much-needed federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    Food stamps\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture says it does not have the money to provide  food stamps  to nearly 42 million Americans next month amid the government shutdown. If the benefits are indeed halted, it would be the first time such a stoppage has taken place.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, is expected to provide about $8 billion in assistance in November. The agency has a contingency fund, which contains between $5 billion and $6 billion, but Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins maintains that it cannot be used to cover next month’s benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and advocates disagree, arguing that the money should be shifted to fund November’s benefits. A coalition of 25 Democratic-run states  sued  the Trump administration on Tuesday, claiming that the agency cannot suspend benefits indefinitely and refuse to spend available funds to provide assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Some states are allocating more money for emergency nutrition assistance to their residents in need, while Virginia is setting up an alternative food benefit program. But in most cases, the efforts only cover a small fraction of the missed payments.\n \n\n   \n  The potential pause in food stamp benefits has also put a lot of pressure on food banks and pantries, which are already stretched thin from rising prices and increased need.\n \n\n   \n    Head Start\n \n\n   \n  Starting on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families are at risk of losing access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households, according to the National Head Start Association.\n \n\n   \n  Some 140 programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will miss their federal funding, which was set to be paid either on October 1 or November 1, if the government shutdown continues.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, there are about 1,600 Head Start programs in the US, but they obtain federal grants at different times of the year so most are not yet affected by the shutdown. They serve a total of a little more than 750,000 children and receive just over $12 billion in funding annually.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the programs that haven’t received their federal funds could have to temporarily close their doors, said Tommy Sheridan, the association’s deputy director. But others — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n    Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program\n \n\n   \n  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start. The aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  Most states are continuing to take applications, though they are warning residents that the grants are paused until the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  Those most at risk are people in cold weather states who heat their homes with heating oil or propane, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That’s because a lot of states have rules that prevent electric and natural gas companies from cutting off service to delinquent customers during the winter, but those protections don’t apply to firms that deliver fuel.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Wolfe expects many states to try to use their own funds to help any vulnerable households until the LIHEAP grants are processed, though he is concerned that states could be tapped out since they may also have to provide more emergency food aid during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, even when the government reopens, it’s expected to take weeks for the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute the LIHEAP funds to states. And the process could take even longer this year since  HHS laid off its LIHEAP team  during its major reorganization in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  LIHEAP received about $4 billion in funding in the last fiscal year. Similar appropriations were working their way through Congress before the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Once the government reopens, the Administration for Children and Families, a division of HHS, will “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” an HHS spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    WIC\n \n\n   \n  WIC continued operating in October thanks to a  $300 million infusion  from the Trump administration, which tapped leftover tariff revenue that typically supports child nutrition programs.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children depend on WIC, formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.\n \n\n   \n  But whether it can provide benefits for November is unclear. The USDA told CNN on Monday that it would use tariff revenue to support WIC for the  “foreseeable future.”  But the National WIC Association told CNN on Wednesday that state agencies have not been informed of additional federal support.\n \n\n   \n  Some state agencies have announced they have enough money to keep their programs operating into November.\n \n\n   \n  Washington’s Department of Health said it can maintain food benefits and a reduced administrative team through mid- to late-November, for instance. In New Hampshire, food benefits will continue at least until November 7, but WIC services may end at several locations on Saturday if the shutdown continues.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/xi-trump-meeting-farmers-bailout","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00Z","title":"'All will be forgiven': Farmers and lawmakers eye Trump-Xi meeting with a bailout hanging in the balance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has managed to unlock over $3 billion in emergency aid for US farmers by reopening 2,100 USDA county offices through a legal maneuver involving a Depression-era fund.

We had to find the money,” a USDA official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The maneuver unlocked more than $3 billion in emergency aid and regular program assistance that had already been approved by Congress, money that will be used for things like crop insurance and disaster assistance made to farmers across the country.\n \n\n   \n  But while the agency was able to get that money out the door, it’s unclear whether farmers will also be helped with a much larger relief package.\n \n\n   \n  Trump officials have debated for months whether to move forward with a  bailout package to help farmers  who have been hit by President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. Discussions have centered on a package of $10 billion to $14 billion, if not higher.\n \n\n   \n  But the  government shutdown  complicated things, raising questions over whether a farm bailout will materialize at all.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown has totally affected this whole process because a lot of the people who were charged with deciding this are furloughed,” a White House official told CNN. “Now the administration, through Treasury and Ag, are reassessing its options.”\n \n\n   \n  The president has also not yet decided on how he would like to proceed, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tariffs prompted China to stop buying US soybeans in May, leaving farmers across the country sitting on billions in unsold crops and some questioning the policies of a president many of them voted for.\n \n\n   \n  Dave Murphy, founder of United We Eat, a farmer advocacy group aligned with Robert F. Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement, said that Trump’s decision to bail out Argentina has soured farmers even more.\n \n\n   \n  “There are farmers that are livid, that have voted for Trump three times,” Murphy told CNN. “If the Trump administration is promising $20 billion, perhaps $40 (billion) for Argentina, he can’t leave farmers behind on this, which is an entirely administration-created nightmare, right, because of the tariffs.”\n \n\n   \n  Now some Trump officials are hoping that a bigger bailout may not be necessary if the president’s sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping results in a deal to lower tariffs and loosen up the trade war. \n \n\n   \n  “We hope we don’t have to use (a bailout). We want China to buy the soybeans, so maybe we don’t have to do a program,” the USDA official said.\n \n\n   \n  In advance of the meeting, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced  a framework agreement  that could prompt Beijing to start buying “a substantial amount” of US soybeans again. China purchased roughly half of US soybean exports last year, according to USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, ahead of the Trump-Xi talks, Rollins  said on X  that China had made its first soybean purchase since May, a sign that the impasse could be easing.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in major farming states have been frustrated by Trump’s whiplash on tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “If he can actually pull off a big trade deal with China that involves the sale of soybeans, all will be forgiven,” Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters Monday, while adding  that he was “exasperated”  by Trump’s latest missive  ending trade talks with and increasing tariffs  on Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The lingering farm bailout is just one of the issues facing Rollins as she navigates the fallout from Trump’s tariffs and the government shutdown. She’s still dealing with the backlash from Trump’s jab at American beef producers last week and the president’s  call to buy Argentinian beef  — after already  bailing out the country itself  with $20 billion.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a group of Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration after the Agriculture Department said  it could not legally pay  $8 billion in food stamp benefits for November with the government shut down.\n \n\n   \n    A candid text message\n \n\n   \n  Soybeans have been the largest US agricultural export, valued at more than $24 billion in 2024, according to USDA data. China purchased about half of those exports last year but has not bought any US soybeans since May.\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself has gotten involved in the discussions over how to best help the struggling soybean industry, in part because Rollins has forced the issue not only with him, but also with Bessent.\n \n\n   \n  A viral  photo of Bessent’s phone captured by the Associated Press  last month showed a text on Bessent’s phone from a contact named “BR,” presumed to be Rollins. Her messages illustrated the deep concerns within the Trump administration over the soybean industry’s woes. It came as the Treasury Department was preparing to send Argentina a $20 billion lifeline — something that  farmers had criticized  as money that should be flowing to them.\n \n\n   \n  “This gives China more leverage on us,” the message said, because Argentina lowered its prices to sell soybeans to China.\n \n\n   \n  Rollins told reporters at the White House earlier this month that she is in “constant communication” with the White House and partners across the government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been blaming China for the pain US soybean farmers are facing, while floating tariff revenue as a way to pay for a bailout. But as a potential meeting with Xi grew closer in recent days, he became more optimistic about coming to an agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ll make a deal,” Trump said in the Oval Office last week, saying he thought an agreement was possible on China’s rare earth materials as well as on soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  Rollins and Bessent work closely on a series of issues because of the nature of their portfolios. When it comes to the farmer bailout, however, their competing interests have at times led them to clash, two White House officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Brooke is solely concerned about farmers and ranchers. Bessent is more concerned about consumers,” one of the officials said.\n \n\n   \n    Shutdown puts bailout plans on hold\n \n\n   \n  White House officials said that a farmer bailout likely would have been announced by now if not for the government shutdown. One official argued the shutdown has not only delayed a relief package, but also changed which mechanism the administration might use to offer aid.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the shutdown, administration officials said, a larger bailout package had been all but decided on. The plan was to use revenues generated from Trump’s tariff policies, as well as money from a little-known USDA fund, to pay for it. However, several of the federal employees tasked with planning and executing the bailout were furloughed during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Administration and congressional sources said that the mechanism for a farm bailout could depend on the size of the package. It’s possible that funds could be tapped through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era program that allows the government to help make up losses for farmers.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration also might need Congress to sign off on directing tariff money toward specific programs or to approve bailout funds in a spending bill.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re just really not sure what approach Congress and the administration are taking,” said Lesly Weber McNitt, president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown makes it harder to have those conversations. “There are a lot of people who are involved in this type of program construction and implementation who are furloughed,” McNitt said. “It’s just really murky right now.”\n \n\n   \n  USDA earlier this month rejected a bipartisan request to brief the House and Senate Agriculture committees on the shutdown, opting instead to brief only Republican members, according to two congressional staffers. Staffers were hopeful that potential relief programs would be discussed in the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Joe Glauber, a former chief economist at USDA in the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said it’s always a challenge to strike a balance of designing assistance packages that help different types of farmers in an equitable way, so that one crop like soybeans doesn’t get more than another.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s still very fluid here,” said Glauber, now a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. “One thing I learned about any farm bailout or farm payments in general — it’s very hard to get them back.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A triple whammy’ hitting farmers\n \n\n   \n  Farm associations have been hesitant to assign a dollar figure to how much relief the industry needs. Some figures floated in congressional discussions have included $20 billion to $30 billion for growers of major commodity crops, such as soybeans, corn and wheat. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has discussed a package in the  $10 billion to $14 billion range .\n \n\n   \n  Not even the higher estimates of aid, if approved, would recoup losses. The growers of nine of the biggest row crops were already projected to lose up to $45 billion this year because of soaring production costs and low crop prices, according to Shawn Arita, an economist at North Dakota State University’s Agricultural Risk Policy Center.\n \n\n   \n  Now there is “a triple whammy” of production costs, low prices, and the trade conflict, which goes well beyond the soybean tussle with China, Arita said.\n \n\n   \n  Many farmers who grow both crops planted more corn this season, resulting in a record 16.8 billion bushels of corn this year.\n \n\n   \n  That is roughly 2 billion extra bushels with no buyers.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to be a major pile of corn with nowhere to go, and that depresses prices,” said McNitt.\n \n\n   \n  Many farmers say they’d rather sell their crops than receive bailouts but argue that it would make sense to use tariff money to help those impacted.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t take money out of the budget. … The tariffs cause some more issues. But why not use the tariff revenues to help get us through this time?” said Bob Worth, a former president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association.\n \n\n   \n  “We were putting all our eggs in one basket, and that basket was China,” added Worth, who has been farming more than five decades. “And China does what China wants to do. You can’t stop it.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s René Marsh and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/americas/brazil-police-raid-rio-de-janeiro-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"13:41:00-20:00","title":"Largest ever police raid in Rio de Janeiro leaves at least 132 dead, public defender’s office says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive police raid in Rio de Janeiro’s Alemão favela on October 29, 2025, resulted in at least 132 deaths, including four police officers, and triggered international condemnation.

Its name, Portuguese for “Red Command,” is a reference to its origins as a leftist prisoners’ organization formed during the military dictatorship that ruled over Brazil until 1985.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Red Command has become a massive, transnational criminal group, involved in drug trafficking and extortion.

But the true extent of the damage in the hardest-hit communities may take days to uncover, as rescue workers and families struggle to reach them.\n \n\n   \n  Three days before landfall, Hurricane Melissa underwent two periods of rapid intensification as it traversed ocean water that were about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than average for this time of year.\n \n\n   \n  Human-caused climate change made such hot water far more likely,  according to the research group Climate Central .\n \n\n   \n  And as it moved through those water, Hurricane Melissa’s maximum sustained winds doubled from 70 mph — a tropical storm — on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane just 24 hours later.\n \n\n   \n  Then from Sunday afternoon through Monday afternoon its peak winds spiked again, going from 140 mph to 175 mph. It then intensified further overnight Monday into Tuesday morning during its final approach to the Jamaican coast.\n \n\n   \n  This type of hurricane behavior is becoming more common. “We’ve seen a notable uptick in the rates of explosive intensification,” with winds increasing by at least 60 mph in 24 hours across most ocean basins, during the past four decades or more, said Steve Bowen, chief scientist at Gallagher Re. It’s what scientists have been predicting, he said: Hotter oceans are going to support “top-tier intensity” hurricanes.\n \n\n   \n  “In short, nature continues to reaffirm the basic laws of thermodynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  Kerry Emanuel, a veteran hurricane researcher at MIT, said we are now seeing evidence of greater human-caused influences on these massive storms.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the third Category 5 tropical cyclone in the Atlantic this year, and the other two also went through periods of rapid intensification,” he told CNN in an email. “Taken together, this season might be said to be consistent with what we have been saying for some time,” he said, which is that: “The proportion of global tropical cyclones reaching high intensity is increasing, as is the incidence of rapidly intensifying storms.”\n \n\n   \n  This season has been “fairly normal” in terms of the number of Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes, Emanuel noted, which is also in line with studies showing that a warming world is unlikely to feature more tropical cyclones per season.\n \n\n   \n  But other research indicates that as the climate warms in response to human-caused pollution, tropical storms and hurricanes are capable of dumping heavier rainfall. This is because warmer air can carry greater amounts of moisture, and warming seas also allow for the evaporation of greater amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere, giving hurricanes more energy.\n \n\n   \n  Ocean temperatures are a primary driver of hurricane strength, Emanuel said. Melissa reached its so-called maximum potential intensity — a metric he devised for determining how strong a storm can theoretically get if it were able to take full advantage of such environmental drivers.\n \n\n   \n  Very few storms reach this point due to inhibiting factors such as strong winds in the upper atmosphere. Melissa managed to do this despite the fact that the maximum potential intensity metric itself was above average for its location in the Caribbean at this time of year, Emanuel said. This mainly reflects the hotter ocean temperatures.\n \n\n   \n  “This storm just pretty much did all of the things you wouldn’t want a storm to do,” said Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at UCLA. He said the reaching of its maximum potential intensity is especially noteworthy, and that the rapid intensification and other observed storm characteristics bear clear climate change fingerprints.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Kossin, a former scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who has conducted multiple studies on hurricanes and climate change, says connecting the dots between Hurricane Melissa and global warming, broadly, is relatively straightforward.\n \n\n   \n  “The very warm water almost certainly has a human fingerprint on it and there is no question that this warm water played a key role in Melissa’s intensity and intensification rate,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts also pointed to the storm’s rapid intensification while located in an ocean basin with unusually hot sea surface temperatures, and hot water extending to deep depths as well, as human-caused factors that helped lead to this disaster.\n \n\n   \n  However, not all aspects of the storm can be so easily attributed to climate change, including its slow movement.  Despite observations of a  trend toward slower-moving storms  in the Atlantic and other ocean basins in recent years, the causal connection is not as well established, Kossin said.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe the most important thing to understand about hurricanes in the warming world is that not all of them will be able to take advantage of the raised ceiling from ocean warming, but some of them will, and this one did,” Swain said.\n \n\n   \n  “And when we have situations like this, where it happens near or over a populated area that is susceptible to major effects, that the subsequent devastation will have been made worse, significantly worse, by climate change.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/middleeast/israel-military-strikes-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"Deadliest day in Gaza since ceasefire as Israel launches wave of strikes, accusing Hamas of breaching truce","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 29, 2025, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes in Gaza, killing at least 104 people — including 46 children and 20 women — marking the deadliest day since the ceasefire agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump.

strikes, accusing Hamas of breaching truce \n       \n  By Abeer Salman, Jeremy Diamond and Oren Liebermann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:54 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 104 people, including dozens of children, the enclave’s health authorities said on Wednesday, marking the deadliest day since the beginning of the ceasefire championed by US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes came Tuesday night after Israel accused Hamas of killing a soldier and staging the discovery of a deceased hostage.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the military to carry out “immediate, powerful strikes in the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a short statement. The US was notified of the decision to carry out strikes in Gaza, a US official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Wednesday it will resume the ceasefire but will continue to “respond forcefully to any violation.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas denounced what it called the “criminal bombardment” by Israel, which it said violated the ceasefire agreement. It also denied attacking Israeli soldiers and reaffirmed its commitment to the truce.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said later that it had “conducted a precise strike in the area of Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip targeting a terrorist infrastructure site where weapons and aerial means were stored, intended to be used for the execution of an imminent terror attack against IDF soldiers and the State of Israel” on Wednesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  The statement added that soldiers in the Southern Command “remain deployed in accordance with the ceasefire agreement and will continue to operate to remove any immediate threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At least 104 people were killed in the strikes across Gaza overnight Tuesday, according to the Ministry of Health in the battered enclave. These include at least 46 children and 20 women, the ministry said. UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the killing of civilians and “all actions that undermine the ceasefire and endanger civilian lives,” his spokesperson said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The director of Al-Shifa Hospital described the health and humanitarian situation as “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are no medicines or medical supplies to treat the wounded and the sick.” Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military named the soldier killed as Master Sergeant Yona Efraim Feldbaum, aged 37, from the settlement of Zayit Raanan in the occupied West Bank. A member of the Combat Engineering Corps in the Gaza Division, Feldbaum died durning combat in southern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.\n \n\n   \n  A military official said Hamas had attacked Israeli troops east of the so-called yellow line, which separates Israeli-occupied Gaza from the remainder of the territory. The troops, in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, had come under RPG and sniper fire, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said it was his understanding that “they killed an Israeli soldier,” without naming Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  “So the Israelis hit back,” he told reporters on Air Force One on his way to South Korea, speaking before the reports of dozens of casualties from the Israeli strikes had emerged.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing’s going to jeopardize” the ceasefire, he added, repeating threats that Hamas would be “terminated.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Tuesday, Netanyahu’s office  said  that Hamas was in “clear violation” of the Gaza ceasefire agreement after returning remains to Israel that did not belong to any of the 13 hostages still unaccounted for in the enclave.\n \n\n   \n  An Israeli official told CNN that among the options being considered are expanding the so-called yellow line – Israel’s withdrawal line in Gaza – reoccupying additional territory, or retaking the Netzarim corridor, which cuts across Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Another Israeli source told CNN that any response would be coordinated with the US, adding that Israel was also considering restricting the flow of humanitarian aid, but Washington opposes such a step.\n \n\n   \n    Israel says Hamas staged discovery\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military also released a drone video on Tuesday that it said shows Hamas operatives burying a white cloth containing a body in Gaza City and then staging its discovery in front of the Red Cross.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearly 15-minute clip, three men are seen dragging a white shroud into a bulldozed plot of land near a building and covering the shroud with dirt. After the shroud is completely covered, a bulldozer scoops up the dirt and drops it into a nearby pile. Moments later, Red Cross officials arrive on the scene as the shroud containing the body is pulled from the dirt. With the Red Cross standing nearby, the video shows the white cloth being buried and uncovered once again as someone with a cell phone appears to take a video of the scene.\n \n\n   \n  The military said the video showed that Hamas “is attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies” of the remaining deceased hostages. CNN cannot independently verify the video or the identities of the individuals in it.\n \n\n   \n  The Red Cross said that its team was “not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones,” the Red Cross said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The organization said that it had agreed to operate as an intermediary “in good faith” and noted that the situation in Gaza is “exceedingly challenging to work in.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment on the video.\n \n\n   \n    Hamas postpones hostage handover\n \n\n   \n  Soon after Netanyahu said Israel would carry out new strikes in Gaza, the armed wing of Hamas announced it would postpone the handover of a hostage’s body that was recovered in southern Gaza on Tuesday due to Israel’s “violations.”\n \n\n   \n  The militant group also warned that any Israeli escalation would “hinder search and excavation operations and the retrieval of bodies” of the deceased Israeli hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas had been set to transfer remains of a deceased hostage to Israel via the Red Cross on Tuesday. The group said the body had been pulled from a tunnel in Khan Younis.\n \n\n   \n  A second body was unearthed in Nuseirat in central Gaza from the rubble of a building where Israel had carried out a rescue operation in June 2024. The operation rescued three Israeli hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas said at the time that other hostages had been killed during the Israeli operation, which both Israel and the US denied. But CNN has geolocated footage from the recovery of the body that shows it is the same building where the rescue occurred, raising fresh questions about whether Israeli hostages were killed during the mission. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said more than 270 Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured as a result of the rescue operation.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas returned partial remains to Israel Monday that did not belong to any of the 13 hostages still unaccounted for in the enclave. Israel identified the remains as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 and recovered during an Israeli military operation in Gaza in November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war on Hamas after the October 7, 2023, terror attacks in which the militant group and its allies killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 hostages to Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  In the two years since, more than 68,000 Palestinians have been killed and over 170,000 injured in the enclave, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.\n \n\n   \n  Thousands of Palestinians are believed to be buried under the rubble.\n \n\n   \n  Israel  approved  the ceasefire on October 9, 2025. The agreement included several conditions, including the release of all Israeli hostages both living and dead, and the withdrawal of some Israeli troops from Gaza. As of Tuesday, Hamas had returned only 15 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages who remained in Gaza at the time the ceasefire was signed.\n \n\n   \n   Ibrahim Dahman, Mohammad Al Sawalhi, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Eugenia Yosef contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/white-house-ballroom-east-wing-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:22:00-20:22","title":"The White House ballroom saga could be worse for Trump than he realizes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s decision to demolish the East Wing of the White House and replace it with a 90,000-square-foot privately funded ballroom has sparked widespread public disapproval, with a 2-to-1 margin of disapproval across multiple surveys.

\nUpdated: \n        12:22 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom saga last week followed a familiar Trump-era arc: A bunch of the president’s critics sounded the alarm about his latest provocation – in this case, the sudden and surprising demolition of the East Wing – and a bunch of other people questioned what the big deal was.\n \n\n   \n  He’s just building a ballroom, after all. And the White House kind of needed a ballroom!\n \n\n   \n  “Of all the reasons to criticize President Trump, this must count as the silliest,” the often-Trump-skeptical  National Review wrote .\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “ a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere .”\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump’s handling of the East Wing and the ballroom.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he’s done in this second term. And it’s not just those  who dislike Trump that are objecting.\n \n\n   \n  A new  Yahoo News-YouGov poll  is the first quality survey to dig into the ballroom saga in depth.\n \n\n   \n  It shows Americans disapproved of Trump’s demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump’s supporters aren’t defending him too hard.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, just 55% of Republicans approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That’s compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.\n \n\n   \n  Just 18% of Americans strongly approved of Trump’s handling of the situation, compared to 46% who strongly disapproved. And those strongly disapproving included a majority of independents: 52%.\n \n\n   \n  So this  does  appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.\n \n\n   \n  None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump’s overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they’re seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.\n \n\n   \n  An important question from there is why people disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  Is it just because they don’t really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “ won’t interfere with the current building ,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)\n \n\n   \n  All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.\n \n\n   \n  While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).\n \n\n   \n  That’s a little counter intuitive.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don’t like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.\n \n\n   \n  What that might suggest: People don’t really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He’s  gilded the interior of the White House . He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they’ve ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts  like a golden crown from South Korea .\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this. A  Pew Research Center poll  conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family.\n \n\n   \n  A  CBS News-YouGov poll  around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn’t focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it doesn’t seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that’s exactly what he was doing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/ukraine-car-bomb-veniamin-mazzherin-death-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"13:07:00-04:00","title":"Ukraine says it killed Russian officer in Siberia using car bomb","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine claims it assassinated Russian military officer Veniamin Mazzherin, deputy commander of a military police unit in Kemerovo, Siberia, using a remotely detonated car bomb.

according to Ukrainian Defense Intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian Guard special unit he helped lead was allegedly involved in “war crimes and genocide against the Ukrainian people” in Kyiv during

on NATO’s eastern flank, as the Pentagon works to shift its focus away from Europe and toward homeland defense and Latin America, US and European officials said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The US is sending home the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division back to Kentucky and will not be replacing the unit after its scheduled rotation out of Eastern Europe, according to US Army Europe and Africa. The redeployment comes as eastern flank NATO countries have faced a spike in threats from Russia in recent weeks, including multiple drone incursions in Polish airspace and repeated violations of Lithuanian airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The Army said the reduction in troops is part of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s “deliberate process to ensure a balanced U.S. military force posture.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an American withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to NATO and Article 5,” the Army press release said. “Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility. Our NATO allies are meeting President Trump’s call to take primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe. This force posture adjustment will not change the security environment in Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Ministry of Defense said in a separate statement that it had “been informed about the withdrawal of some of the American troops deployed on NATO’s Eastern Flank, as part of the process of reassessing the global posture of US military forces.” The ministry added that “approximately one thousand American soldiers will remain deployed on our national territory.”\n \n\n   \n  “The downsizing of the U.S. forces is an effect of the new priorities of the presidential administration,” the Romanian defense statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The US troops will be pulled from Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base on the Black Sea, just across from Crimea which remains under de facto Russian control.\n \n\n   \n  The withdrawal of some troops sparked rare GOP backlash to Pentagon decision making, with Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Republican Rep. Mike Rogers saying in a joint statement that the move “sends the wrong signal to Russia at the very moment President Trump is applying pressure to force Vladimir Putin to come to the table to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed Services committee, said they “strongly oppose,” the decision and called it “concerning that Congress was not consulted in advance of this decision.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are seeking clarification from the Pentagon on how it plans to mitigate the impact of this decision on NATO’s deterrence and defense posture and whether they coordinated with Allies to minimize these consequences,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  The US still has more troops deployed in Europe than it did before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, NATO officials told CNN. But NATO defense planners are watching closely to see whether the US moves to further downsize its presence there, since that would likely require that NATO reconsider how allied troops are deployed across the continent, one of the officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/boeing-china-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00-10:29","title":"Boeing Reports Massive Loss but Hopes for Historic China Jet Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Boeing reported a massive $5 billion core operating loss in Q3 2025, with total cumulative losses since 2019 reaching $47.2 billion, largely due to a $4.9 billion charge from delayed 777X deliveries.

Boeing has sold only 49 jets to China since 2018, with 14 going to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific and virtually all of the the rest made up of freighter aircrafts or sales to Chinese leasing companies, not the airlines themselves.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a small fraction of more than 1,000 Boeing jet sales to Chinese customers in the ten years before 2018.\n \n\n   \n  China is one of the world’s key markets for commercial airline sales given its booming air travel growth. Boeing’s own estimates are that the Chinese fleet of passenger planes is due to double in the next 20 years, with Chinese airlines predicted to buy 9,000 jets.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a market Boeing can’t afford to lose to its perpetual rival, Airbus.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been happy to trumpet sales of Boeing jets to other countries since returning to office, including from  Qatar  and Uzbekistan. So disclosing a large order for Chinese planes as a  trade deal with China  is announced would keep with past practice.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly the administration and the president are doing a great job with helping us book orders in the market,” Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said on CNBC Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about a possible  US-Chinese trade deal , Ortberg said that it’s “important to us.”\n \n\n   \n  “And we’re very hopeful that if we have positive trade negotiations, that will come with some more business with us,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Some plane orders might not be “new”\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say it’s possible that many of the “new” orders from China were booked by Boeing over the last nine years, but not announced due to trade tensions and the Chinese government trying to put leverage on the US government.\n \n\n   \n  Of the roughly 6,000 jets that Boeing has in its backlog, more than 850 are to “unidentified customers.” More than 600 additional jets have been sold to leasing companies that could be buying them on behalf of Chinese customers.\n \n\n   \n  But even if some of the orders announced as part of the deal were quietly booked already, well over half will likely be new jet orders, Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst for Bank of America, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    “Caught in the crossfire”\n \n\n   \n  Many of Boeing’s problems can be traced back to the company’s own mistakes, such as two 737 Max crashes tied to a design flaw that killed a total of 346 people.\n \n\n   \n  But Boeing’s problems in China don’t really stem from safety concerns, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s 100% politics,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t some sort of internal screw up,” said Epstein. “They’re just caught in the crossfire.”\n \n\n   \n  But even if Boeing announces a mega deal with China is announced, it still has other problems to deal with.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday it reported a much bigger than expected core operating loss in the third quarter of $5 billion, bringing cumulative losses since the 737 Max grounding in 2019 to $47.2 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that latest loss was due to a $4.9 billion charge due to another delay in the start of deliveries for the 777X, its next generation widebody jet that it now said won’t be ready until 2027.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/tech/nvidia-5-trillion-valuation-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:58:00-04:00","title":"The world’s most valuable company just blew through an unprecedented milestone","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nvidia has become the world’s first company to reach a $5 trillion market valuation, marking a historic milestone in global technology and finance.

It took Nvidia about 13 months to go from $3 trillion to $4 trillion in valuation.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s shares ( NVDA ) rose 3% after the market opened on Wednesday.

injury has plagued MLB for most of the last century, but a new phenomenon is emerging \n       \n  By Jamie Barton, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:02 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Kade Durnin knew right away that something was badly wrong.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s unlike any other feeling that you’ve probably ever had, in terms of arm pain,” the 19-year-old college pitcher says in an interview with  CNN Sports . “It feels like you got hit in the funny bone – it’s just not very funny.”\n \n\n   \n  Durnin was training his arm when he felt a pop. Before long, a doctor was delivering the news that no pitcher wants to hear: He had torn his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL).\n \n\n   \n  It is an injury which has plagued  Major League Baseball  for the best part of the  last century . The ligament in your elbow which connects the bone in your upper arm to the one in your forearm – and is only about as strong as “a piece of celery” – tears, leaving you unable to throw and facing a very lengthy spell on the sidelines.\n \n\n   \n  This season, the likes of  Gerrit Cole , Corbin Burnes and Shane Bieber have all had  Tommy John surgery  – the most popular procedure to repair a torn UCL – while Japanese superstar  Shohei Ohtani  made his long-awaited  return to the mound  after almost 22 months away following the second elbow surgery of his career.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Christopher Ahmad, Tommy John expert and head team physician for the  New York Yankees , has performed the surgery on some of the biggest names in baseball. But he has also been privy to the other side of the story.\n \n\n   \n  “The alarms are going off on how devastating this problem is to the youngest players,” he says in an interview with  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  “When I first started doing Tommy John surgery about 25 years ago, the population who I was operating on who needed the surgery were essentially very high-level players – they were college prospects destined to be professional, or professional players.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, the population who needs the surgery most are kids.”\n \n\n   \n  Of the 10-15 Tommy John surgeries that he performs every week, Ahmad estimates that between eight and 10 are on high school children, with some even still in middle school.\n \n\n   \n  Such a high number of young players going under the knife is a relatively new phenomenon. In 2005, four players selected in the top 10 rounds of the amateur draft had already had Tommy John surgery earlier in their college or high school careers. By 2025, that figure had increased ninefold to 36.\n \n\n   \n  But why?\n \n\n   \n    Need for speed\n \n\n   \n  One issue is that, simply, young pitchers are throwing faster than they ever have before.\n \n\n   \n  “The big problem now is performance. It’s the desire and the hunt for velocity,” says Ahmad.\n \n\n   \n  With thousands of aspiring college and professional players across the US, and an increased emphasis on pitch speed in the professional game, one surefire way to get noticed is to put the biggest number on the radar gun.\n \n\n   \n  “The chase in velocity is really impacting these kids,” says Frank Alexander, the athletic trainer who works with Ahmad’s patients during their recovery phase, in an interview with CNN Sports. “Everybody’s chasing triple digits, and these kids just want to keep up with the Joneses.”\n \n\n   \n  That chase has created a burgeoning industry of “velocity enhancement programs” and special techniques designed to get young players throwing fast.\n \n\n   \n  In Durnin’s case, that technique was pulldowns, a drill where pitchers take a running start to try and throw as hard as they possibly can.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a training technique popularized by Driveline,” he explains. “There’s a lot of mixed feelings upon it because it does have a tendency to cause injuries.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Driveline for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “I was doing pulldowns, I was trying to break the facility record (of 101 mph). I did not break the record, and I got hurt doing so,” Durnin adds with a wry smile.\n \n\n   \n  “It does seem a bit reckless. If you’re watching you’re like ‘Well, this seems like something wrong can happen.’ But obviously you can get injured doing many things. I don’t think pulldowns are bad. I don’t think pulldowns are going to injure you 100%. I think just with all training methods, you’re toeing the line between excellence and energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Baseball is such big business nowadays that players are willing to put their own health on the line more than ever before if it means a shot at earning truly life-changing money.\n \n\n   \n  The chance – however slim – of bringing in Ohtani or Juan Soto money ($700 million and $765 million, respectively), is one that many are happy to take the risk for.\n \n\n   \n  “I had some draft interest. I had met with probably around half of the teams via Zoom or in-person meetings. And so that was a big gold mine. Along with every other baseball player, you want to get drafted and pursue a professional career,” Durnin explains.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to get yourself in those conversations and be able to get drafted and get paid what we want to get paid, you have to be the top .001%. And in order to be that top .001%, you have to have a skillset – and that’s throwing hard, that’s throwing really good pitches. In order to do that, you have to train, and if you’re not willing to train really hard and push the limits, someone else is, and that person will take your spot.”\n \n\n   \n  Alex Hoffman was even younger – just 15 – when he tore his UCL. Like many teenagers, he was playing two different positions.\n \n\n   \n  “I was definitely overworked and I definitely wasn’t taking care of myself as much as I should,” Hoffman, now 17, says in an interview with CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “I was catching and pitching. So that was a lot of stress on the arm, constantly throwing the ball back or throwing the ball to the catcher. My arm never really had a break. So, ultimately, I believe that it was just that my arm couldn’t keep up and it broke down.”\n \n\n   \n  No one asked Hoffman to play both positions. No one asked Durnin to try and break the facility’s velocity record. Both – understandably eager to play and impress – took it on themselves to stretch their bodies to the point where their elbows could not take any more.\n \n\n   \n  But, in the 10 years he has worked with Ahmad, Alexander has seen plenty of instances when coaches and scouts  have  directly pushed their young athletes too far.\n \n\n   \n  “One kid that we had was in high school when he had Tommy John surgery, and his pre-surgery velocity was in the low 90s,” he remembers.\n \n\n   \n  “He was talking to the college that he was being recruited by, he had a verbal commitment with them, and it was going to the year that he could sign his National Letter of Intent. So he was rehabbing, he was 10 months post-op, and the coaches are like, ‘You need to be throwing low 90s.’\n \n\n   \n  “And I remember vividly the conversation with him, mom and dad in the room, and I’m like ‘Whoa, this is a rehabbing elbow. This isn’t a healthy elbow. That’s an unrealistic goal for you at 10 months post-op.’”\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, in his chase to keep hold of that non-binding verbal commitment, the young pitcher broke down again.\n \n\n   \n  “He was chasing that velocity … he’s knocking on the door of being completely cleared, getting ready to be back and play. And he said his elbow started bothering him again,” Alexander says. “Later, we came to find out that the school actually pulled the scholarship.”\n \n\n   \n  While not every case is that extreme, the mismanagement of young players is rampant in the US – one 2021  study  found that 90% of youth teams it surveyed were violating Pitch Smart guidelines, which stipulate pitch counts and rest times for young pitchers.\n \n\n   \n  “Coaches have to win at the college level, even at the high school level, so they’ll abuse players more often than we would like to see,” explains Ahmad. “We would like to see parents and coaches protecting kids. They actually need to win also for their job security.”\n \n\n   \n    Mental scars\n \n\n   \n  When, in 1974, Dr. Frank Jobe took a tendon from Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tommy John’s forearm and tied it through the bones in his elbow, Jobe estimated the chances his patient would pitch again at one in 100.\n \n\n   \n  John, though, went on to pitch in three World Series and three more All-Star games. The surgery, frankly, was and is a miracle.\n \n\n   \n  These days, there are success stories all across baseball. Ohtani sent the Dodgers to this year’s World Series with a win and 10 strikeouts – not to mention  three home runs  – against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 4 of the NLCS.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, both Durnin and Hoffman are delighted they went under the knife, and both are now back on the diamond and making the next steps in their promising careers.\n \n\n   \n  Such is the publicized success of the surgery, many players treat it as a foregone conclusion that they will have to take a year out of their careers at some point.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s now a culture and an appreciation that Tommy John surgery is kind of part of the game. I often call it the Tommy John generation,” says Ahmad. “Everybody just has this feeling that it’s inevitable.”\n \n\n   \n  On the other side of the  World Series  matchup, Bieber has returned to the elite level even quicker than Ohtani, starting two games and winning one as the Toronto Blue Jays’ snatched the ALCS from the Seattle Mariners despite only coming back to play in late August.\n \n\n   \n   Game 4 of the World Series  on October 28 – where the Blue Jays drew even with the Dodgers at two games apiece – even saw Bieber face off against Ohtani in an all-Tommy John pitching contest which simply would not have been possible without the incredible advancements the surgery has allowed.\n \n\n   \n  Nowadays, many view a UCL injury as a significant bump in the road rather than a career-ending injury. But not everyone is as fortunate as John, Durnin and Hoffman.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a misperception about how good the operation is,” explains Ahmad. “With surgery, from a performance perspective, we’ll have a very high chance of getting back to baseball. But your performance may not be the same.”\n \n\n   \n  On top of that, the general prevalence of UCL injuries appears to be making MLB teams think far more carefully about whether to select pitchers in the draft.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of all available pitchers selected in the first three rounds dropped from 73% in 2014 to 38% in 2025, which is perhaps unsurprising when you consider that a 2021  study  found that 70% of pitchers entering the draft had abnormal findings on MRI scans of their elbow.\n \n\n   \n  “I do have a role with the Yankees where I help identify risk factors for potential players: amateur players in the draft, professional players who are free agents, etc. And part of that evaluation is what their future potential for injury is,” says Ahmad.\n \n\n   \n  “So many clubs now are being a little more cautious about how they use their draft picks when there’s injury potential and they’re going to lose that draft pick to surgery and time away from baseball.”\n \n\n   \n  The risks of injury and subsequent surgery can extend beyond a sporting context. In 2021, college pitcher Sang Ho Baek  died  following complications from Tommy John surgery shortly after his freshman season.\n \n\n   \n  While instances like Baek’s are thankfully extremely rare, the psychological impact of a UCL injury can often be devastating to young players. Alexander recalls giving the bad news to one prospect.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re telling him: ‘Your UCL is torn,’” he remembers. “And this kid, he had such a visceral reaction, he actually started rocking back and forth on the examining table, and he’s like ‘No, it’s not. It’s not. It can’t be.’ And he was being talked about getting drafted even out of high school, so his world just came crashing down around him.”\n \n\n   \n  For many players, the extended period spent away from the field can be just as difficult as the moment they find out about their injury.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a year-long recovery and, during that year-long recovery, it’s hard to be away from the game,” says Ahmad, who is in the process of setting up what he calls a “Tommy John support group” for recovering players. “They lose their identity. The fear of failure starts to creep in.”\n \n\n   \n  “Every day is constant mental warfare,” Durnin reflects on his rehab. “You have two sides. One side is telling you that you’re never gonna get back, and that these guys are so far ahead of you that you’re always going to be chasing them. And the other side is like ‘Hey, you can do it, you know it, you’re fine.’”\n \n\n   \n  The mental anguish experienced by these young men is often even more serious than what the likes of Durnin went through – a recent  study  conducted by Alexander and Ahmad, among others, concluded that nearly 30% of baseball players who sustained a UCL injury qualified for a probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n \n\n   \n  “There were players that had symptoms that could lead to future immune system compromise,” Alexander comments. “So what they’re experiencing is real.”\n \n\n   \n  In the past, MLB has been receptive to rule changes to protect the safety of its athletes – just ask anyone running from third base who no longer has to barrel through the catcher in order to touch home.\n \n\n   \n  The problem with pitching, however, is any adjustment would result in a profound change to the sport.\n \n\n   \n  “There may come a time when we design rules around baseball that say you can only throw so many pitches,” says Ahmad. “There may come a time when we say, if you throw too hard, that’s illegal – you can’t throw 102 miles an hour. I’m being a little silly because I don’t think that’s ever going to really happen.”\n \n\n   \n  The Yankees physician points to the possibility of six-man rotations to aid rest and recovery.\n \n\n   \n  But teams will always look for players who can throw hard and often. Fans like them. Teammates like them. Coaches and scouts like them.\n \n\n   \n  “What we celebrate for performance is also exactly what puts you at risk for needing the surgery,” Ahmad explains.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the essential problem in baseball: what makes you better also makes you injured.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/entertainment/elijah-wood-lord-of-the-rings-set-wedding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:37:00-12:37","title":"Elijah Wood returns to Hobbiton and crashes a wedding","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elijah Wood, the actor best known for his role as Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s 'The Lord of the Rings' film trilogy, unexpectedly appeared at a Middle-earth-themed wedding taking place at the Hobbiton set in New Zealand's Waikato region.

Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration’s  crackdown on illegal immigration  often looks like a car crash.\n \n\n   \n  Literally.\n \n\n   \n  There have been car crashes between federal agents and suspects trying to flee. There have been alleged “rammings” involving pro-immigrant activists. There have been dramatic traffic stops featuring smashed windows and law enforcement shootings. Even the standoffs outside ICE facilities have focused on tense moments around the arrival or departure of federal vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  These incidents, many captured on video, have provided some of the most dramatic visuals of the immigration crackdown this year.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re the most highly visible, and I think they’re so unusual that it shocks the psyche to see federal agents making administrative warrant arrests and using potential deadly force tactics,” said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the  Council on Criminal Justice , a nonpartisan think tank.\n \n\n   \n  The crashes show federal law enforcement’s use of aggressive tactics in busy city streets, such as dangerous “PIT” maneuvers, unmarked cars and masked officers, law enforcement and immigration   experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The collisions also reflect the desperate fear of the immigration targets, who, in some cases, have tried to flee when faced with the potential end of their freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “Often people in their cars get scared and they try to drive away, knowing that stopping and talking to ICE might end up in a severe violation of their constitutional rights and arrest and detention,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the  American Immigration Council , a pro-immigration nonprofit group.\n \n\n   \n  “This kind of interaction on the streets – using traffic stops, people fearful when ICE or federal agents are following them – leads to the kinds of accidents and crashes that we’re starting to see in the news.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE Assistant Director of Public Affairs Emily Covington issued a statement to CNN on Monday about the “concerning increase in vehicular attacks” in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “Attacks against ICE law enforcement have increased by 1000% since last year, and aggressors are now purposefully running into officers, boxing in law enforcement vehicles, running ICE law enforcement off the roads, and ramming their cars into law enforcement vehicles. This isn’t just the criminal alien targets doing this, but also bystanders who are obstructing and attacking us.\n \n\n   \n  “Encouraging these attacks has tragically resulted in serious bodily injury and hospitalizations thanks to the demonization of and flagrant disregard for ICE officers who work around the clock to arrest and remove public safety and national security threats from America’s streets, following the laws passed by Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement: “Anyone who intentionally rams law enforcement with their vehicle will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law—that’s a promise.”\n \n\n   \n    Vehicles used as arrest tactic\n \n\n   \n  Some of these car crashes have been initiated by federal agents and show a willingness to use  aggressive and potentially dangerous tactics .\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago on October 14, US Border Patrol agents  pursued and crashed into a vehicle  as part of an immigration enforcement operation, leading to an angry response from community residents.\n \n\n   \n  The incident unfolded when a white SUV hit the side of a red SUV, sending it backward through the intersection before it   crashed into another vehicle, video captured by a nearby resident showed. What appeared to be federal agents can then be seen exiting the white vehicle and chasing two people.\n \n\n   \n  The red SUV was driven by a person in the country illegally who rammed a Border Patrol vehicle before trying to flee the scene, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN. Agents used “an authorized precision immobilization technique (PIT) maneuver,” which forces a vehicle to spin out and stop, said DHS.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents eventually arrested the two individuals, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  “The PIT maneuver, a standard law enforcement technique used by law enforcement agencies across the country, is a specific tactic to defuse a dangerous pursuit situation,” McLaughlin told CNN. “CBP used the PIT maneuver once in Chicago — and it was to  stop a pursuit and dangerous situation  after two individuals tried to kill Border Patrol law enforcement officers.”\n \n\n   \n  A PIT maneuver is considered a use of deadly force and is justifiable in certain situations, depending on the suspect’s risk to the public, the risk to the officer and the potential collateral damage of a crash, according to Jerry Robinette, a former special agent in charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a series of factors that agents have to take into account before they even become involved in a high-risk pursuit,” he said. “When you’re involved in a high-risk pursuit, one of your main responsibilities is the general public, along with yourself and the violator.”\n \n\n   \n  Video of an October 16 crash in  Oxnard, California , also shows federal agents performing what appears to be an intentional crash.\n \n\n   \n  Video of the incident shows a dark gray truck driving in circles with an unmarked beige SUV closely following him around. Once the truck begins driving straight, the beige SUV speeds up and slams into the truck’s back-left side. It is not immediately clear what happened before the video starts.\n \n\n   \n  Leo Martinez, the driver of the truck, is a US citizen and an  immigration rights volunteer . He told CNN’s Erin Burnett last week he is one of multiple volunteers who have been patrolling neighborhoods in Ventura County to document ICE detentions and was shocked when the SUV he says was driven by federal agents drove into his truck.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez told CNN he was temporarily detained and then released from custody pending charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security responded to the incident in a statement, calling it a “targeted enforcement operation.”\n \n\n   \n    Crashes and traffic stops have led to shootings\n \n\n   \n  Traffic stops and car chases have long been considered some of the most dangerous of law enforcement   activities, and indeed some of these crashes have led to injuries and death.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, an  ICE officer fatally shot a man  who DHS said resisted arrest and dragged the officer during a vehicle stop in a Chicago suburb, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant, according to DHS. The officer, who was not immediately identified, was released from the hospital after suffering injuries, an ICE spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  In another incident, Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old US citizen, was  shot five times  by a US Customs and Border Protection agent after her vehicle and a federal law enforcement vehicle collided on October 4 in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  A federal criminal complaint accuses Martinez of ramming her car into the federal vehicle, and a DHS official referred to her as a “domestic terrorist.” However, her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows the federal agent swerved into her vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez has pleaded not guilty to a charge of assaulting, resisting, and impeding officers.\n \n\n   \n  In Los Angeles earlier this week, a federal marshal and an undocumented immigrant were injured after an agent’s weapon discharged during an immigration enforcement operation, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors allege  Carlitos Ricardo Parias , a TikTok influencer, rammed law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to dislodge his car during an immigration arrest. Authorities said Parias is a 44-year-old Mexican national living illegally in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Parias has been charged with assault on a federal officer, according to a  statement  from the US Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very pacifist man. He’s very calm,” his lawyer Carlos Jurado told  CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS . “A lot of the police officers here know him. They know that he’s very respectful.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators believe gunfire erupted after an ICE officer confronted the suspect’s vehicle and smashed a window with their service weapon, a law enforcement source said. While attempting to grab the suspect, authorities believe the agent’s weapon discharged, striking both the suspect and a deputy US marshal. They are both expected to recover, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the mistrust of immigration enforcement can be dangerous for both suspects and officers, said Johnson, the senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice.\n \n\n   \n  “People are afraid,” he said. “If you’re afraid and you don’t trust the authorities – fight, flight or fear. Those responses to fear can get you killed or get officers hurt.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/health/hand-food-mouth-disease-coxsackie-virus-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-04:00","title":"Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease on the Rise in Mid-Atlantic: Symptoms, Spread, and Prevention","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hand, foot and mouth disease is on the rise in the mid-Atlantic region, with a notable increase in emergency department visits in September 2025, particularly among children under age 5.

The  Virginia Department of Health  is also reporting significant increases in emergency department and urgent care visits for hand, foot and mouth disease. Compared with previous years, in Virginia and  West Virginia , there has been a notable increase in reported outbreaks, with schools and day care centers accounting for the majority of outbreaks.\n \n\n   \n  What is hand, foot and mouth disease, and what causes it? How is it spread? What are the symptoms, and how long do they last? Can adults also get it? How is it diagnosed and treated? Should parents keep children home from school or day care when they have it? What steps can families take to help prevent infection?\n \n\n   \n  To help us answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is hand, foot and mouth disease? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  Hand, foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious  viral illness  that primarily affects infants and young children. It’s caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. It is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease, which affects farm animals like cattle, sheep, pigs and goats and does not infect humans.\n \n\n   \n  Hand, foot and mouth disease gets its name from the small blister-like sores it causes on the hands and feet and inside the mouth. While the illness can be uncomfortable, it is generally mild and resolves on its own.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is it spread, and who is most at risk? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads very easily through close personal contact and contaminated surfaces. A person can become infected after being exposed to droplets released when someone with the illness coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread through touching an infected person, such as during hugging, kissing, or sharing cups and utensils. The virus is present in stool as well, so changing diapers or helping a sick child in the bathroom can lead to infection if hands aren’t washed thoroughly.\n \n\n   \n  It can also spread when someone touches objects or surfaces like toys or doorknobs that have the virus on them, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. Rarely, people can become infected by swallowing contaminated recreational water, such as from a pool that hasn’t been properly treated.\n \n\n   \n  Young children are most at risk because their immune systems are still developing, and they are more likely to struggle with personal hygiene and share toys and have close contact with others.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What are the symptoms, and how long do they last?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:   The first sign  of the disease is usually a fever, followed by a sore throat and a general feeling of being unwell. These flu-like symptoms typically start three to five days after catching the virus. A day or two later, small painful spots can develop inside the mouth, often on the tongue, gums or inner cheeks. These spots can turn into tiny blisters or ulcers, making it uncomfortable for children to eat or drink.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, a rash can appear on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the buttocks, legs or arms. The rash may look like flat red spots or small bumps that can form blisters, but it typically doesn’t itch. Some children have the mouth sores without the rash, while others have the rash without any sores.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are mild and clear up on their own in about a week to 10 days. During that time, it’s important to keep children well hydrated, since mouth pain can make them less willing to drink fluids.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Can adults also get it?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes, although it’s much more common in young children. Because most people are first exposed during childhood, adults often have some immunity. Still, anyone who hasn’t been infected before or whose immune system is weakened  can catch it  through close contact with someone who is sick.\n \n\n   \n  When teenagers or adults do get hand, foot and mouth disease, symptoms are usually mild or may not appear at all. Some adults may have only a sore throat or mild rash without the typical mouth sores or blisters. However, they can still spread the virus to others, including young children.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is hand, foot and mouth disease diagnosed and treated?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Health care providers usually diagnose the disease based on the characteristic symptoms and recent exposure to other sick children. A physical exam is typically enough to confirm the diagnosis. In rare cases, if the illness looks unusual or severe, the clinician may collect a throat swab or stool sample to test for the specific virus.\n \n\n   \n  There is no specific medicine that cures hand, foot and mouth disease. Because it’s caused by a virus, antibiotics do not help. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can reduce fever and mouth pain, and cool, soft foods or cold drinks can make eating and drinking more comfortable.\n \n\n   \n  Staying hydrated is the most important part of care, since mouth sores can make swallowing painful and dehydration can develop quickly in young children. Most cases clear up on their own without complications, but parents should contact a doctor if a child cannot keep fluids down, has a high fever lasting more than a few days or seems unusually drowsy or irritable.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Should parents keep children home from school or day care?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Because hand, foot and mouth disease tends to be mild, children don’t need to stay home for the entire illness. The guidance from the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  is that they can return to school or day care once they no longer have a fever, feel well enough to take part in normal activities, and can manage any mouth sores without excessive drooling.\n \n\n   \n  Parents should also check with their school or day care, since specific policies may vary. The CDC cautions that in some situations, such as during an outbreak, the local health department may ask families to keep affected children home temporarily to help limit further spread.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there steps families can take to help prevent infection? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes. Regular and thorough handwashing is one of the most effective protective measures.

  8:18 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As a breastfeeding mom of a toddler – and with another child on the way – Gabrielle knows how vital it is to get the right nutrients, with her body serving both her children in different capacities.\n \n\n   \n  But the 21-year-old mother is worried about what the coming weeks will look like for her family as the  second-longest  government shutdown in US history threatens their access to a  critical food assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle, who asked CNN to use only her first name due to the perceived stigma around needing assistance, is on﻿e of the 42 million Americans who rely on the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP , the formal name for food stamps. But with SNAP benefits set to halt in the next few days, Gabrielle finds herself stretching her family’s limited finances in order to fill her refrigerator.\n \n\n   \n  “SNAP benefits are a must right now,” she said, adding her fiancé’s workload has been slow and she’s currently out of work herself.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in online forums usually reserved for finding handyman recommendations and lost pets, or buying and selling gently used belongings, neighbors are stepping up for one another as “grocery buddies,” creating a patchwork solution for vulnerable families across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how it works: Neighbors post on social media in community groups or public forums about their willingness to be a “grocery buddy” and help a family at risk of losing SNAP benefits. The poster asks those interested to send them a private message. Together, they find a grocery solution that makes sense for both parties.\n \n\n   \n  Assistance may look different for each pairing: In some cases, “grocery buddies” do the shopping, while in others, they accompany one another to the supermarket and shop together. Some “grocery buddies” provide their counterparts gift cards, giving them agency and control in a time of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the grassroots effort has spread, as messages offering and seeking assistance are cut, copied and pasted throughout communities big and small, connecting neighbors and finding those in need tangible help.\n \n\n   \n  This week, faced with the prospect of losing SNAP assistance and the stress of the holidays around the corner, Gabrielle, a West Virginia resident, reluctantly raised her hand in a community Facebook group.\n \n\n   \n  “I kind of almost didn’t want to comment because I knew other people were going to see it,” Gabrielle said, adding she didn’t want to be judged based on her situation.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, she decided it was worth a shot if it meant helping her family.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s what I would want done for me’\n \n\n   \n  A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, SNAP provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of  $188 per person , as of May. But amid the government shutdown, the US Department of Agriculture has said it  doesn’t have the funds  to pay $8 billion in food stamp benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  When beneficiaries will feel the impact varies, since states typically provide the benefits on a rolling basis during the month. Some will miss their payments as soon as Saturday, while others won’t be hit until later in November.\n \n\n   \n  There aren’t many good alternatives: While Americans can turn to food pantries and other food assistance programs, recent years have seen these groups under pressure from rising food prices and increased need.\n \n\n   \n  “Now more than ever, community aid is going to be very important,” Micah Iverson, a resident of Hatteras Island, North Carolina, told CNN. “At the end of the day, we’re all on the same team here.”\n \n\n   \n  Iverson posted on Sunday about his desire to serve as a “grocery buddy” for someone in his tight-knit community. He was floored by the responses of people in need, he said, but also the willingness of others to help further his cause and donate additional funds.\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor of Iverson’s reached out to him on Facebook and connected him with his grocery buddy, a single mother of four. After a few messages were exchanged, the 31-year-old went to his local Food Lion and ticked away at the items on the mom’s grocery list.\n \n\n   \n  To pay, Iverson said he used a $300 gift card he won during office trivia, turning it into a fridge full of food.\n \n\n   \n  Later that evening, within hours of his initial post, Iverson was dropping off a trunk full of groceries to the mom after she got off work, he said. Upon meeting, the strangers – now friends – “hugged it out” as tears filled his eyes, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s what I would want done for me,” Iverson said, adding he and his husband plan on helping the same family﻿   as long as their own financial situation allows.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I encourage others to consider this if you can’\n \n\n   \n  Kristin Schmidt knows what it’s like to be hungry and on the receiving end of a wholesome meal. Now, she’s honored to be the one doing the giving.\n \n\n   \n  The minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Silver Spring, Maryland, told CNN she was inspired by a friend’s social media post looking for a “grocery buddy” and decided to do the same in a Facebook group for local moms.\n \n\n   \n  “If SNAP benefits run out in November, I would be happy to provide groceries for you and/or your family,” she wrote, adding, “I can only afford to take on one grocery buddy, but I encourage others to consider this if you can.”\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help from SNAP, according to the latest data from the US Department of Agriculture. That statistic haunted Schmidt, who said she would be unable to sleep at night if she didn’t do something to help.\n \n\n   \n  Her motivation “comes out of a deep, core belief in the preciousness of every single person,” she said, “and wanting to make sure that the people in my neighborhood have what they need – just as a basic human right.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few days, the mother of three was overwhelmed by the number of comments on her original post. And she said she was inundated with messages from other people wanting to offer help to their neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting and connecting in person, Schmidt said she plans to continue supporting her new “grocery buddy” – a disabled grandmother relying on SNAP to feed her grandson – through supermarket gift cards.\n \n\n   \n  “My community would be less if she didn’t get the support that she needs,” Schmidt said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Gabrielle hasn’t yet found a “grocery buddy” to help with her family’s immediate needs.\n \n\n   \n  But she remains hopeful – and grateful that, through another community Facebook post, she was connected with a neighbor who offered to cover her family’s Thanksgiving meal.\n \n\n   \n  For now, she said, that’s one less worry on her plate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/trump-xi-meeting-agenda-vis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Trump and Xi are set for a high-stakes summit.

\n        7:33 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If there’s anyone who knows what it takes to win, it’s  Michael Jordan .\n \n\n   \n  Arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan won six  NBA  championships and five MVP awards during his storied spell with the Chicago Bulls.\n \n\n   \n  But looking at today’s landscape, Jordan isn’t overjoyed by the current trend of players missing games in order to protect their bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on Tuesday’s segment of “MJ: Insights to Excellence” on NBC, Jordan was asked for his opinion on “load management,” which is when a healthy player strategically misses a game in order to avoid injuries or prevent fatigue.\n \n\n   \n  “Well, it shouldn’t be needed, first and foremost,” Jordan said. “I never wanted to miss a game because it was an opportunity to prove. It was something that I felt like the fans are there that watch me play. I want to impress that guy way up on top who probably worked his (butt) off to get a ticket or to get money to buy the ticket.”\n \n\n   \n  Jordan highlighted his iconic “ Flu Game ” in the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz as an example of him going to extreme lengths to ensure he was on the court.\n \n\n   \n  Despite suffering apparent flu-like symptoms the night before and during the game, Jordan – through sheer strength of will and determination – scored 38 points to help his Chicago Bulls win 90-88 in Game 5 and put his Bulls one game away from the NBA title.\n \n\n   \n  “I was going to find a way to get out there, even if I was a decoy,” the 62-year-old said. “Well, once I got out there, you never know how – pushing yourself – you never know what happens, right?\n \n\n   \n  “Next thing you know, the emotions, the situation, the need of the team.

They swept us. They were better than us last year. We didn’t make it tough on them. It was very easy. As a leader of this team, I remember. I don’t forget things.”\n \n\n   \n  Milwaukee’s fourth quarter comeback came after a scary moment for the Knicks when Brunson appeared to injure his groin when scrambling for a loose ball.\n \n\n   \n  He remained in the game but moved gingerly and, just seconds later, he fell backwards in clear pain, causing a turnover which Antetokounmpo turned into a dunk at the other end to level the score.\n \n\n   \n  Brunson played out the loss, but his injury status is uncertain.\n \n\n   \n    Warriors beat Clippers with defensive masterclass\n \n\n   \n  The Golden State Warriors have begun the new season strongly and kept it rolling with a convincing 98-79 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n \n\n   \n  The Warriors leaned on their stifling defense for the victory, holding the Clippers to 36.6% shooting from the floor and 18.2% from beyond the arc; Draymond Green had three steals and Steph Curry had two.\n \n\n   \n  With that defensive structure providing a platform, Golden State’s stars performed on the offensive end, with Jimmy Butler pouring in 21 points and Curry adding 19.\n \n\n   \n  “Challenging every shot, keeping them off the free throw line,” Butler said of the team’s defensive effort. “It always helps to make shots so we can get back in transition.\n \n\n   \n  “Guys are confident, happy, playing some great basketball.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday, the Warriors had lost their last seven games to the Clippers. They improve to 4-1 with the win while the Clippers fall to 2-2.\n \n\n   \n  In the victory, Butler surpassed the 16,000-point mark in the NBA, doing so in his 15th season in the league.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/obamacare-premiums-increase-2026-coverage","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:46:00-04:00","title":"Obamacare enrollees get first look at 2026 prices as premiums soar","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Obamacare enrollees are being confronted with a dramatic rise in health insurance premiums and a looming loss of enhanced subsidies, which could drive millions out of coverage.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Premiums for Affordable Care Act coverage will skyrocket 26%, on average, next year, according to a KFF analysis released Tuesday evening, just days before open enrollment starts on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  The price hike is one of the largest jumps since Obamacare plans debuted more than a decade ago — and it doesn’t factor in the  expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Consumers in the 30 states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, can now get a preview of what they’ll pay for 2026 coverage. The site opened for so-called window shopping on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The monthly premium for the benchmark plan on healthcare.gov will soar 30%, on average, according to the KFF analysis, which is based on data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In states that run their own exchanges, the benchmark plan premium will rise by an average of 17%.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s not all the bad news: The actual amount enrollees pay in 2026 will be far, far higher because the enhanced premium subsidies will disappear. Their monthly payments are expected to more than double, according to a separate analysis from KFF, a health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  Those window shopping on healthcare.gov will get a full sense of the sticker shock, many for the first time. The premiums on the site reflect the lapse of the enhanced assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Still, most enrollees will be able to find 2026 plans on the federal exchange with premiums at or below $50 a month, after factoring in the original Obamacare subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and not expiring, according to a CMS fact sheet.\n \n\n   \n  But the impact of the expiring enhanced assistance is clear: Nearly 60% of enrollees signing up for 2026 coverage can find plans in that price range, compared to 83% of consumers in 2025 plans.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration frequently touted that four out of five enrollees on the federal exchange could find plans for $10 or less in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The CMS fact sheet, which is the agency’s first release on 2026 open enrollment, did not mention the increase in insurers’ premium rates.\n \n\n   \n    Fight over extending the subsidies\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the beefed-up subsidies is at the  center of the battle on Capitol Hill  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown, which began October 1. Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Renewing the subsidies would cost $350 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n \n\n   \n  While the enhanced subsidies, known as premium tax credits, don’t expire until the end of the year, the damage will be done well before that, say Democrats and ACA advocates. Once consumers see much higher premiums, they may not return to sign up for coverage — even if lawmakers renew the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The only time premiums on the federal exchange increased even more was in 2018, after President Donald Trump eliminated federal support for Obamacare subsidies that help people pay for their  out-of-pocket costs . Premiums shot up by 37% that year, reflecting insurers’ uncertainty about the future of the landmark health reform law in the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n    Paying at least double\n \n\n   \n  Several states that run their own Obamacare exchanges have announced that premiums will at least double next year if the enhanced subsidies lapse.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, premiums will soar to more than $2,780 annually — a jump of more than 174%, on average — because of the enhanced subsidies’ expiration and insurers’ rate hike of 16.6%, according to the state’s Department of Banking and Insurance. About 60,000 enrollees in Get Covered New Jersey will completely lose federal assistance in paying their premiums in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers will soon be shopping and comparing health plans, and without these enhanced tax credits, they will be confronted by startlingly higher prices for coverage,” Commissioner Justin Zimmerman said in a statement. “We are significantly concerned that many households will be forced to choose plans with lesser coverage or choose no coverage at all as a result.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, enrollees in Connect for Health Colorado will see premiums increase an average of 101% next year, the state’s Division of Insurance announced. Roughly 75,000 residents will lose access to health coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Without the enhanced subsidies, a family of four living in the Denver area with an annual income of about $128,000 would no longer qualify for premium assistance and would see their annual premium bill soar by $14,000 for the standard silver plan.\n \n\n   \n  But if the more generous assistance is extended, the average increase for enrollees would be 16%.\n \n\n   \n    Record enrollment\n \n\n   \n  The  enhanced subsidies,  which a Democratic Congress approved in 2021 and extended the following year, have helped drive Obamacare sign-ups to a  record 24 million  for this year.\n \n\n   \n  Around 17 million people signed up for 2025 coverage on healthcare.gov. Another roughly 7 million enrollees live in states that run their own exchanges.\n \n\n   \n  Many Republicans would be affected by the ending of the enhanced subsidies since they live in states that had the highest increases in signups, according to KFF.\n \n\n   \n  The more generous subsidies have enabled many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no or very low monthly premiums and broadened eligibility for assistance to many middle-class consumers.\n \n\n   \n  But the more generous aid also opened up the exchanges to  fraud , mainly by brokers and agents who sought to earn commissions by enrolling people in Obamacare policies or switching them to new ones without their knowledge or consent.\n \n\n   \n  If the subsidies expire, consumers are expected to flee the exchanges. About 4 million more people would be uninsured in 2034, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis — and that’s on top of the roughly  10 million more people  who will lack coverage due to the One Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/trump-says-clear-no-third-term-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:11:00-04:00","title":"Trump Says It’s ‘Pretty Clear’ He’s Not Allowed to Run for a Third Term","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has stated it is 'pretty clear' that the U.S. Constitution prevents him from running for a third term, citing constitutional limitations as a key reason.

How did we get here and what might come next? \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:28 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sudanese rebels have driven government forces from El Fasher, the last stronghold of the country’s regime in the western Darfur region, amid a brutal struggle for territory that has led to alleged genocide and contributed to one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has besieged El Fasher, its final major barrier to controlling Darfur. The RSF aims to establish a parallel government in the region. It has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for power since April 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Estimates suggest that  more than 150,000 people have died  due to the conflict, while an additional 14 million have been displaced from their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Sudan’s army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is also the de facto head of state, acknowledged the rebels’ capture of El Fasher. In a  broadcast  on Monday, he stated that his troops retreated from the city due to the destruction and systematic killing of civilians.\n \n\n   \n  Justin Lynch, a Sudan researcher and managing director of Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and conflict monitoring organization, told CNN that the RSF’s capture of El Fasher marks “the beginning of what we fear to be a massacre of civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Tom Fletcher, the United Nations humanitarian chief, hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped in El Fasher, lacking food and health care. He  reported  that escape routes have been blocked amid “intense shelling and ground assaults” that “have engulfed the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has  claimed it is committed  to protecting civilians in El Fasher and providing safe corridors for those seeking to leave.\n \n\n   \n  However, the  UN Human Rights Office said  it had received “multiple, alarming reports” of the RSF committing atrocities including summary executions of civilians, and videos showing dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead surrounded by RSF fighters.\n \n\n   \n  It also cited “indications of ethnic motivations for killings.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Jalale Getachew Birru, a senior analyst at the crisis-monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), there is a “high risk of ethnically targeted attacks, particularly against non-Arab groups.”\n \n\n   \n  Between April 2023 and mid-October 2025, her organization documented 390 incidents of violence against civilians in El Fasher and surrounding areas, resulting in over 1,300 reported fatalities, along with 180 attacks on internally displaced persons (IDPs) that caused at least 830 deaths.\n \n\n   \n  Ethnically motivated killings have been a feature of the conflict from its outset, particularly in Darfur. The region experienced some of its worst ethnic violence in 2023, with hundreds of individuals from non-Arab ethnic groups  massacred  by the RSF and forces linked to it.\n \n\n   \n    How did we get here?\n \n\n   \n  For the past 30 months, army leader al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads the RSF, have been fighting over control of Sudan.\n \n\n   \n  These two men, once allies and among the most powerful generals in the country, jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from power in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  They also played significant roles in a  subsequent coup in 2021  when al-Burhan seized control from Sudan’s transitional government.\n \n\n   \n  Both generals have faced Western sanctions due to their involvement in war crimes. However, Dagalo’s RSF, along with its allied Arab militias, has been  accused by the United States of committing genocide  during the ongoing civil war. This marks the second time in two decades that the US has declared genocide in Sudan.\n \n\n   \n  The US government said when making the declaration in January that the RSF had executed “direct attacks against civilians,” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, it said, they had “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” and “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Sudan’s military government has  accused the United Arab Emirates  of supplying weapons to the RSF, although the UAE has denied this.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the RSF?\n \n\n   \n  The RSF is a paramilitary group with an  estimated 100,000 fighters , approximately  half the size of the SAF .\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has a history tied to ethnically-driven violence.\n \n\n   \n  The group emerged from the Arab Janjaweed militia, which was responsible for the genocide in Darfur during the early 2000s. That resulted in an estimated 300,000 deaths.\n \n\n   \n  The recent killings in El Fasher and other areas of Darfur reflect a pattern of targeted violence similar to that seen during the earlier genocide.\n \n\n   \n  According to Lynch, the RSF’s takeover of El Fasher will “only mean more misery for civilians.”\n \n\n   \n    Why is El Fasher’s capture significant, and what might happen next?\n \n\n   \n  The RSF’s seizure of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, represents a significant turning point that allows the group to strengthen its hold on the broader Darfur region, according to Birru.\n \n\n   \n  It comes in the wake of the SAF  regaining control of the country’s capital , Khartoum, from the RSF earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Fighting is now expected to shift to the central and oil-rich Kordofan region, which borders Darfur, according to Birru.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF  announced  on Saturday it had taken Bara, a crucial transport hub in North Kordofan state that connects the strategic town to the rest of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “In Kordofan, the SAF and its allies are seeking to secure key routes connecting central Sudan to the Darfur region, while the RSF is working to consolidate control across both regions to rein in its alternative government in western Sudan,” Birru said.\n \n\n   \n  “The outcome of battles in El Fasher and Kordofan will likely determine the future trajectory of Sudan’s conflict and the country’s political future,” she added, amid a global push for a ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  International human rights lawyer Yonah Diamond told CNN that the international community must intervene as violence escalates in Sudan and civilian casualties increase in El Fasher, asking whether world leaders would allow the RSF “to commit another genocide in Darfur with impunity.”\n \n\n   \n  “The time for emergency action is right now – to end the bloodshed, open humanitarian corridors, and protect the people of El Fasher and what’s left of any global conscience,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/ubs-third-quarter-profits-soar-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:03:00-04:00","title":"Profits soar for UBS in third quarter, exceeding expectations","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"UBS reported a 74% surge in third-quarter net profit to $2.5 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations, driven by financial market volatility from global tariff turmoil and robust M&A activity.

But he passed up regular season games there this year. He also passed up once-frequent US trips elsewhere to see his team.\n \n\n   \n  Murray did go to see a league championship game in Seattle last week. But he skipped his usual hotel room and drove six hours roundtrip rather than spend the money in the United States.\n \n\n   \n    LA games cheaper for many Jays fans\n \n\n   \n  It was also cheaper for Murray to see a game in LA than in Toronto. The travel expenses were lower, and when he shopped for tickets in Toronto, there was a limited supply selling at two to three times face price.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles has a larger stadium, therefore more tickets, so Murray was able to get an upper deck ticket for face price.\n \n\n   \n  Other Canadian Jays fans at Monday night’s game also found the tickets more affordable than in Toronto.\n \n\n   \n  “We tried to get tickets over there (in Toronto),” said Jat Yassine, who is from Toronto and talked to CNN at the game Monday. “They were sold out very, very fast, and then any of the resale market (tickets) were almost double the price of LA.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from SeatGeek shows average ticket prices of nearly $1,400 in both stadiums as of Monday evening. But those averages were driven up by the most expensive seats. The least expensive seats sold on SeatGeek were closer to $400 in Toronto and $300 in Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  Shimon Sitzer, a Jays fan originally from Toronto who now lives and works in suburban New York, said he met other Jays fans from Canada at the game Monday who had been avoiding US travel but broke down to come to the game.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s actually some people I know would have maybe come if not for the situation with (President Donald) Trump,” he said. “But I met people at the game (from Canada) who said ‘We’re not here to support the United States or its president, we’re here to support our baseball team.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/iran-rebuilding-ballistic-weapons-program-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"10:31:00+00:00","title":"Western intelligence says Iran is rearming despite UN sanctions, with China’s help","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran appears to be actively rearming its ballistic missile program despite the reinstatement of UN sanctions via the snapback mechanism, with China allegedly playing a critical role in supplying the essential chemical sodium perchlorate. Multiple shipments of 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate have been tracked from Chinese ports to Iran’s Bandar Abbas, including via vessels like MV Basht, Barzin, Elyana, and Artavand, some of which used concealment tactics. These shipments follow a pattern of increased activity after Iran’s 12-day conflict with Israel, which damaged its missile stock. Although the UN bans the provision of materials that could support nuclear weapon delivery systems, sodium perchlorate is not explicitly named, allowing China to argue that the shipments fall outside direct prohibition.

10:31 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Following a similar route, the Barzin traveled from Gaolan on October 2 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 16, before leaving for China again on October 21.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/portland-federal-agents-admission-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"06:21:00-04:00","title":"Appeals Court to Reconsider Ruling That Allowed Trump to Deploy National Guard Troops to Portland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to reconsider its earlier decision blocking President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, following an en banc rehearing with 11 judges.

Bernie in a Monday  letter  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals filed in the court record.\n \n\n   \n  In Oregon, “115 (Federal Protective Service) officers have had to deploy to Portland” due to monthslong protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility there, an official with that agency – which provides security to government-owned properties – said earlier this month in an  affidavit  in support of a troop deployment.   \n \n\n   \n  “The continued deployment of FPS officers in response to the immigration protests stretches an already thin force beyond what is safe and effective,” Regional Deputy Director Robert Cantu said in the affidavit.   \n \n\n   \n  Those 115 officers amounted to “nearly a quarter of the agency’s entire FPS capacity,” Trump administration attorneys originally said.\n \n\n   \n  However, this “statement was incorrect,” Bernie acknowledged in the Monday letter, noting only about half that number were agents sent out to provide security.\n \n\n   \n  The admission calls into question a key part of the president’s justification for deploying the guard: “FPS, which is the regular security force charged with protecting the (ICE) Building, is stretched to the point of collapse,” the Trump administration argued in its original court  filing .\n \n\n   \n    Dissenting judge had questioned Trump administration details\n \n\n   \n  The conservative majority on the appeals panel in the Portland case criticized  Immergut , a Trump appointee, in its decision earlier this month for failing to take the administration’s claims about Portland security needs – specifically, the numbers Cantu cited – at his word.\n \n\n   \n  “Our colleague in dissent and the district court cannot summarily dismiss Director Cantu’s sworn and undisputed statements,” the majority  wrote  in an October 20 filing.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Trump administration says many of the 115 agents cited by Cantu were effectively double counted, with some deployed more than once. The actual number of FPS agents sent to Portland was 86, and only 65 were “inspectors” whose primary job is providing security, Bernie’s letter says.\n \n\n   \n  In her dissent, US Appeals Court Judge Susan Graber said she was unimpressed with Cantu’s affidavit, considering it vague.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not know why the government chose not to file a declaration describing the relevant details,” the Clinton appointee wrote in her October 20 dissent. “But it cannot submit an ambiguous assertion and then ask us to interpret that assertion in its favor.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, despite the erroneous filing, even the smaller number of agents shows “the surge of FPS personnel in response to violence and unrest is unsustainable” and Trump has justification to send in the National Guard, Bernie says in the Monday letter.\n \n\n   \n  “Although defendants regret any unintended ambiguity about the number of deployed FPS officers at any given time, there is no basis for concluding that any such ambiguity was the basis for the majority’s decision,” the attorney wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court stay this month did not rely solely on the number of agents. “The statute … does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider” in deciding whether ordinary agents cannot enforce federal law without military help, judges wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Oregon told court Trump administration’s math didn’t add up\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice only discovered the mistake after it was raised by attorneys for plaintiffs Oregon and Portland, Bernie’s Monday letter says.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs in their own  letter to the court  noted the numbers in Trump administration filings conflicted with each other, ultimately showing a maximum of 31 FPS officers in the field at any one time.\n \n\n   \n  “This Court must act swiftly to prevent defendants from attempting to benefit from their own material mistake to deploy military forces to peaceful civilian streets, contravening the rule of law and our nation’s history and traditions,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield wrote.\n \n\n   \n  For now, a separate restraining order from Immergut prevents National Guard troops from any state from being deployed in Portland. Following a hearing last week on the federal request to end that restraining order, the judge has not yet made a decision.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/adidas-us-sales-drop-tariffs-yeezys-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:54:00-04:00","title":"Adidas Sales in North America Drop Over Tariffs and End of Yeezys","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Adidas reported a 5% drop in North American sales in Q3 2025, primarily due to the end of the popular Yeezy line and a volatile global environment shaped by rising US tariffs.

Start of late charge in Baltimore? QB uncertainty in Minnesota? NFL Week 8 takeaways \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:39 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The theme of the 2025  NFL  season’s Week 8 was gnarly blowouts from pre-game favorites, with a sprinkling of shock results.\n \n\n   \n  There wasn’t a more surprising result than the New York Jets  getting their first win  of the season in a high-scoring affair against the Cincinnati Bengals, while the under-fire head coach of the Miami Dolphins, Mike McDaniel, also got a much-needed win on the road against the Atlanta Falcons.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the three main takeaways from  Week 8  of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Big names to be traded before deadline?\n \n\n   \n  All 32 teams have until November 4 to agree to trades to improve right now or acquire assets to bolster their future.\n \n\n   \n  One team that could be shipping off some of its star players is the New York Jets, who have reportedly been receiving calls for defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and running back Breece Hall.\n \n\n   \n  According to  NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport , it would take a “huge offer” for Williams to move from New York, but teams have enquired about the possibility of trading for the three-time Pro Bowler.\n \n\n   \n  Hall, who scored three touchdowns as the Jets got their first win of the season on Sunday, is more unlikely to be moved but has still received interest, per Rapoport.\n \n\n   \n  The 1-7 Tennessee Titans are also likely to be sellers ahead of the deadline, with the franchise  reportedly open  to trading away anyone aside from 2025 No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward and star DT Jeffery Simmons.\n \n\n   \n  One of the Super Bowl contending teams who could be active at the deadline is the  Buffalo Bills .\n \n\n   \n  The team’s run defense has been porous to start the season and could get worse following the torn bicep suffered by defensive tackle Ed Oliver; Bills head coach Sean McDermott  confirmed  Oliver would undergo surgery and will be out indefinitely.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo might look for help in the middle of their defensive line with Oliver absent, with Williams making a lot of sense to fill that gap.\n \n\n   \n  Whether it be Super Bowl-aspiring teams looking for that final piece to get them over the top or another trying to unload big contracts in return for draft picks, there could be plenty of action over the next week.\n \n\n   \n    Start of a late charge in Baltimore?\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a season to forget in Baltimore for many reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Injuries have plagued the roster at numerous key positions, including star quarterback Lamar Jackson, who has missed the last four weeks, and two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike, who suffered a season-ending neck injury in Week 2.\n \n\n   \n  And with the roster down to its bare bones, the Ravens have struggled, falling to 2-5 and their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.\n \n\n   \n  But in Week 8 – coming off a bye – they got back to winning ways.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore’s game against the Chicago Bears saw the return of full-back Patrick Ricard on offense – a key component in their usually-proficient running game – as well as star linebacker Roquan Smith and starting cornerback Chidobe Awuzie all taking to the field.\n \n\n   \n  With a more complete team, the Ravens looked much more like their usual selves, romping to a 30-16 victory in which every facet of the team shone.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens were still without Jackson on Sunday, despite some confusion around his availability as he looks to return from a lingering hamstring injury.\n \n\n   \n  The two-time NFL MVP was listed as a full participant in Friday’s practice before being ruled out of Sunday’s game; his practice participation grade was later changed to limited.\n \n\n   \n  After Sunday’s victory, head coach John Harbaugh said he was “hopeful” that his star QB would return for Baltimore’s Week 9 game against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “As a coach, you ask: ‘How is he doing?’ That’s about as much as you do,” Harbaugh told reporters. “‘How are we doing it? What do you think?’ … The coaches aren’t involved in statuses and whether guys play or not.

murder trial  of a sheriff’s deputy who shot Sonya Massey, a Black woman who had called 911 for help and was later killed in her home because of the way she was handling a pan of hot water.\n \n\n   \n  The nine-woman, three-man jury received the case Tuesday and deliberated for about 6 1/2 hours. Jurors must decide whether Sean Grayson, 31, is guilty of murder for fatally shooting Massey in Springfield.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and another deputy answered Massey’s emergency call reporting a prowler outside the 36-year-old woman’s home early on the morning of July 6, 2024. They entered the house and, spotting a pan of hot water on the stove, Grayson ordered it removed, according to the other deputy’s body camera video, which was key evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and Massey joked about how Grayson moved away as Massey moved the hot pan. Then, Massey said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” Grayson yelled at her to drop the pot and threatened to shoot her. Massey apologized and ducked behind a counter.\n \n\n   \n  “She makes it abundantly clear, ‘I want no part of this. Let this be done,’” Sangamon County First Assistant State’s Attorney Mary Beth Rodgers said in her closing argument.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Daniel Fultz beseeched the jury to decide how Grayson felt in the moment, “not to sit back 15 months later and say, ‘This is what I would have done.’”\n \n\n   \n  “It is true that she put the pot down. If it ended there, we wouldn’t be here today, but for reasons we’ll never know, she reacquired the pot, stood up and threw it in his direction,” Fultz said. “Only at that time did he fire his weapon.”\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of Black people in their homes. The accompanying publicity, protests and legal action over the incident prompted the judge to move the trial from Springfield, 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, to Peoria, an hour’s drive north of the capital city.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted of first-degree murder, Grayson faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison. The jury also has been given the option of considering second-degree murder, which applies when there is a “serious provocation” of the defendant or when defendants believe their actions are justified even though that belief is unreasonable.\n \n\n   \n  Second-degree murder is punishable by a term of four to 20 years or probation.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/fema-investigation-trump-dhs-probe-noem","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"FEMA Investigation Clears Agency, But Noem’s Probe Fuels Political Firestorm","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump criticized FEMA’s response to Hurricane Helene, falsely claiming that aid was politically targeted toward undocumented immigrants and Republican areas.

narrative. His DHS ordered a new probe that did \n       \n  By Gabe Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the final month of the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump put his critique of FEMA’s response to Hurricane Helene front and center, making  false claims  that funding was stolen for illegal migrants and the agency ignored requests for help.\n \n\n   \n  One particular claim had legs – that Republican residents were not getting the aid they needed because of their political affiliation.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation that began under then-President Joe Biden and carried over into the Trump administration ultimately cleared the Federal Emergency Management Agency, finding no evidence of a systemic effort to deny aid based on politics while singling out one supervisor’s actions as illegal and improper.\n \n\n   \n  But at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, leadership including Secretary Kristi Noem weren’t satisfied, three former senior FEMA officials told CNN. Within weeks, leaders ordered a new investigation that came to a much different conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Noem announced last week that the DHS probe found “for years, FEMA employees under the Biden Administration intentionally delayed much-needed aid to Americans suffering from natural disasters on purely political grounds.” She called it “textbook political discrimination” against Trump supporters.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation looked at whether FEMA workers who went door-to-door in disaster zones recorded any protected private information about survivors’ political views. It found roughly 100 field reports — a small fraction out of tens of thousands of cases during the Biden administration — where FEMA workers visiting homes mentioned campaign signs or made notes related to “political beliefs.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators flagged a few instances where canvasser notes mentioned “Trump” or “Biden,” but in most cases, workers were documenting gun signage, which also was categorized as political. The report does not show that disaster survivors were denied aid because of these notations, and sources say the gun notations were often made for safety reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Noem portrayed the findings as proof of FEMA’s “widespread” and “systematic” bias and said she would  refer the issue to the Justice Department for potential prosecution  —  her latest public attack on an agency she argues needs sweeping reforms or even abolition. Behind the scenes, insiders accuse DHS and Noem of stoking rumors and misinformation to help justify tearing FEMA down, as some argue it’s the Trump administration using disaster aid as a political weapon.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been looking to prove that narrative any way they can, and to me, this is just a fabricated way of advancing it when really it’s not factually there,” said one of several FEMA officials who asked not to be named for fear of retribution.\n \n\n   \n  “If we do something wrong, okay, hold us accountable,” the official added. “But don’t fabricate it because it meets your political narrative. That’s just bad government.”\n \n\n   \n    Two hurricanes and a political firestorm\n \n\n   \n  The political firestorm began last September after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Then-candidate  Trump accused FEMA  and the Biden administration of ignoring Republican areas and spending all its disaster aid on undocumented immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  FEMA workers soon faced threats and hostility in disaster zones, and some teams were  pulled from areas for safety . Weeks later, Hurricane Milton hit the Florida coast. FEMA teams, now stretched thin up and down the coast, reported widespread harassment fueled by Trump’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  In late October, FEMA field supervisor Marn’i Washington delivered a now  infamous directive  to her 11 staffers deployed in Florida: “Avoid homes advertising Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington told CNN at the time that her supervisors had issued the orders, citing concerns about abuse from Trump supporters. However, the investigation later determined that no such directive was given; it was Washington’s own interpretation of how to protect her team.\n \n\n   \n  FEMA leadership working under the Biden administration fired Washington and denounced her actions, deploying staff to the homes that may have been skipped. Then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell was called before Congress, where she condemned the directive as illegal and unacceptable, and said she’d already referred the case for further investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “I stand by the testimony I provided to Congress under oath. When the initial incident came to light, I immediately took decisive action and addressed the situation,” Criswell told CNN in a statement last week. “I remain confident that we responded appropriately to the information we had.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Florida’s attorney general  filed a lawsuit  alleging civil rights violations against FEMA and Criswell. To some, Washington’s actions were proof that Trump was right: FEMA is biased against Republicans.\n \n\n   \n    An investigation clears FEMA\n \n\n   \n  Over the next four months, FEMA’s Office of Professional Responsibility, Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Special Counsel investigated the incident and broader agency culture – a probe that carried into Trump’s term.\n \n\n   \n  Days after his inauguration, Trump visited western North Carolina and floated the idea of eliminating FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  In March, Trump’s acting FEMA administrator, Cameron Hamilton,  told lawmakers  that three additional staffers had been fired in connection with the Washington incident, primarily for poor supervision or misleading investigators, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Hamilton’s letter to Congress said investigators found “no evidence that this was a systemic problem, nor that it was directed by agency or field leadership.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, they found the opposite: that politics rarely came up in disaster zones.\n \n\n   \n  “Tens of thousands of records were screened and reviewed. We found there was no reasonable evidence to authenticate a statement that denial of aid or assistance occurred based upon political bias from FEMA leadership,” Hamilton told CNN this week. “These isolated incidents were awful and a breach of public trust, however I did not see evidence that they were systemic across the agency. I say this as a lifelong Republican and supporter of President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The probe formally  cleared Criswell and FEMA  in April, and Florida settled its lawsuit with no damages paid.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, agency leaders believed the case was closed and perhaps the findings would ease the anti-FEMA rhetoric from Trump and Noem. They were wrong.\n \n\n   \n    A second look at FEMA wrongdoing\n \n\n   \n  Roman Jankowski, the newly appointed head of DHS’s Privacy Office and an alum of the Heritage Foundation, launched a separate review weeks after the internal probe concluded and requested the data investigators had relied on, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Jankowski took a different approach, focusing on whether FEMA aid workers violated privacy laws by recording protected information — such as political beliefs — and whether that information could have been used to withhold disaster aid for political reasons. His review went beyond the initial investigation, which focused solely on the 2024 hurricane season, and examined data from the entirety of Biden’s four years in office.\n \n\n   \n  “He definitely made it clear that he suspected FEMA was involved in broad-scale wrongdoing,” said a senior FEMA official who spoke directly to Jankowski about the review. “You could tell he had already arrived at a conclusion that FEMA as an agency needed to be severely punished, which was evident in his tone and language.”\n \n\n   \n  Jankowski’s team released its report last week.\n \n\n   \n  The  22-page report  concludes FEMA canvassers going door-to-door repeatedly violated – or may have violated – privacy laws by collecting information on survivors’ political beliefs, and in a handful of cases, bypassed certain homes based on the details they noted.\n \n\n   \n  But more than a dozen current and former FEMA officials argue that the evidence does not support claims of a systemic problem. They point out canvassers referenced Trump just 15 times in their reports, and it remains unclear whether workers never returned to those homes.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a statistician, but when you’re looking at four years of data across tens of thousands of damaged homes, it doesn’t seem significant,” former FEMA chief of staff Michael Coen, who served under the Biden and Obama administrations, told CNN. “It doesn’t demonstrate that people were discriminated against in a systematic way.”\n \n\n   \n  FEMA officials say these freeform notes are primarily used to alert colleagues about field conditions, especially for safety, and were not surprised that most of the so-called “partisan” notes referenced gun signage.\n \n\n   \n  After Hurricane Helene, those safety worries reached a fever pitch. Trump’s relentless attacks on FEMA had sparked a wave of threats against the teams trying to help survivors in North Carolina, leaving workers on edge.\n \n\n   \n  “We were hearing that guys in trucks with guns were out looking for FEMA employees, and the teams were freaked out,” a former senior official deployed to North Carolina said. “Let’s have common sense. FEMA employees are not law enforcement officers. They’re not walking around with bulletproof vests. This idea that they’re just going to run into harm’s way to register somebody is ridiculous.”\n \n\n   \n  The report points to a few specific entries from canvassers who allegedly skipped homes, such as: “Survivor very anti govt anti Biden. Told me to tell Biden to go [f***] himself” and “…a lot of explicit political flags, posters, etc. ‘F*** Joe Biden’ ‘MAGA 2024’ ‘Joe Biden Sucks’ ‘Trump 2024.’ We do not recommend anyone visiting this location.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS raised concerns that such notes likely led FEMA teams not to return to the homes.\n \n\n   \n  But Noem has been more definitive in her claims about what the investigation found, saying the probe found “FEMA employees systematically refused to visit the houses of disaster survivors that displayed signs and flags they disagreed with, including those with campaign signs supporting President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s FEMA  ended door-to-door canvassing  earlier this year, largely because of safety concerns and the fact that most survivors now apply for FEMA assistance online or through call centers, not through canvassers.\n \n\n   \n  Several current and former senior FEMA officials acknowledged that some canvassers may have violated privacy laws and agreed that reviewing those cases would be appropriate. However, they cautioned that using this as evidence of an agencywide systemic effort to deny aid based on politics is unfounded.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether or not there was bias in note taking, that’s a highly subjective analysis, but we didn’t find it to be sufficient to conclude wide-spread impact,” Hamilton said this week of the first internal investigation.\n \n\n   \n    The next phase of Trump’s war on FEMA\n \n\n   \n  As Noem paints the agency as partisan and inept, the new FEMA Review Council is set to present recommendations for reforms in the coming weeks. Trump has vowed to start phasing out FEMA after hurricane season, though he hasn’t detailed what that will entail.\n \n\n   \n  From the outset, Noem positioned herself as Trump’s point person to fulfill his promise to dismantle FEMA. She now says the goal is to eliminate FEMA “as it exists today,” and she’s made clear that “cleaning house” and asserting control are central to that process.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s trying to drive this narrative of how woke, terrible and unaccountable FEMA is, which is why they need to abolish it,” one former top official said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, current and former FEMA officials say her attacks continue to erode public trust in the agency responsible for helping disaster survivors in their most vulnerable moments.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s dangerous,” said Coen, the former FEMA chief of staff. “The faith in FEMA has declined. When people lose their trust in the federal government in a time of need, they’re going to feel more helpless.”\n \n\n   \n  Some FEMA officials note the irony of these accusations, as Trump himself faces criticism for politicizing disaster aid —  repeatedly   posting  on  Truth   Social  about sending millions to states that supported him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week,  Trump announced  $2.5 million for Missouri after speaking with its Republican governor, despite FEMA recommending denial because the damage was below the agency’s threshold for federal aid to be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  “That request was dead and buried in our minds,” a senior FEMA official involved in the process told CNN. “Our damage assessments didn’t seem to indicate the recovery was beyond the State’s capacity. And believe me, we’re generally eager to help our state partners when it’s warranted.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration had previously  fast-tracked FEMA money to Missouri  while emergency funds for other states remained frozen.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, Democratic-led states like Maryland and Washington have been denied disaster aid by the president, even when their damage far exceeded FEMA’s threshold and approval was recommended.\n \n\n   \n  Noem has ramped up her rhetoric in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, she issued a press release announcing the firing of a FEMA staffer and an agency contractor for viewing sexually explicit content on government devices.\n \n\n   \n  “We are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended,” she wrote at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Since pledging to dismantle FEMA at the start of the administration, DHS leaders have subjected staff to polygraph tests, publicly fired employees, and placed dozens on administrative leave without warning or explanation. More than a quarter of FEMA’s full-time workforce has left through layoffs and buyouts, including dozens of senior leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, DHS has consolidated power at FEMA, filling leadership roles with political appointees and pushing out career experts who helped shape disaster response and recovery.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/australia/australia-cruise-passenger-lizard-island-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:42:00-04:42","title":"Elderly woman found dead on tropical island after cruise ship leaves without her","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An elderly woman in her 80s was found dead on Lizard Island, a tropical resort island off Queensland, after a luxury cruise ship, the Coral Adventurer, departed without her.

Now the US is flexing its military might \n       \n  By Katie Bo Lillis, Sean Lyngaas, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the final year of President Donald Trump’s first administration, the CIA carried out a clandestine cyberattack against the Venezuelan government, disabling the computer network used by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s intelligence service.\n \n\n   \n  The attack, described to CNN by four sources familiar with the operation, was perfectly successful.\n \n\n   \n  It was also a throwaway, those sources said — an effort by the CIA to satisfy the president’s ambitions to do something about Venezuela and avoid taking riskier, more direct action against Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  The previously unreported episode was one of a series of moves that national security officials took to placate Trump during his first term in office as he sought to oust Maduro, covert maneuvering that came to deeply frustrate the president and his team as the Venezuelan strong man remained stubbornly in power.\n \n\n   \n  It helps underscore the president’s public determination to take a maximalist approach toward Venezuela in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  Since the summer, the US has amassed a huge military force in the region, including roughly 10,000 troops, with an aircraft carrier now en route from Europe. The president has said in recent weeks that the US is considering direct strikes on Venezuelan territory, and that he has authorized the CIA to conduct covert activity there. A series of what the military termed “attack demonstration” flights off the Venezuelan coast by US bombers last week were an even more visible indicator of the US’ intentions.\n \n\n   \n  Although the administration has characterized the mission for all those military assets as a counternarcotics effort, the size and scope of the buildup has raised the specter of a possible regime-change operation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump during his first term routinely demanded that he be provided military options to pressure Maduro. But White House officials felt that they were given the runaround by Pentagon and intelligence leaders, whom multiple sources described as reluctant to initiate or escalate a conflict with Venezuela. In one meeting at the White House in 2019, a top Pentagon official reportedly  banged his fist on the table  in frustration after repeated demands from White House officials for more aggressive options.\n \n\n   \n  “In the first Trump administration, he said that all options are on the table,” said Jimmy Story, who was the top US diplomat to Venezuela from 2018 to 2023. “Many of the options are now at the front door.”\n \n\n   \n  The lesson Trump likely took from that earlier era — when a series of officials sought to temper the US policy towards Maduro — was that he would not be stymied this time, said one former senior administration official: “I told these guys I wanted the military option in 2018 and 2019, they didn’t give me one — I want a real one now,” this person said, summing up the president’s thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and CIA did not provide comment for this story ahead of publication when contacted by CNN. Cyber Command declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Get it done’\n \n\n   \n  Trump first requested military options to remove Maduro from power from his second national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, at a meeting at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, in 2017, according to a former White House official. He told the assembled press later that day: “I’m not going to rule out a military option for Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  He would return to the request more than once, as he pressed subsequent national security advisers to find a way to get rid of the Maduro regime and grew increasingly frustrated that it hadn’t happened.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it done,” Trump told his national security adviser John Bolton in August of 2019, meaning oust Maduro, Bolton wrote in his book. “This is the fifth time I’ve asked for it,” Trump continued.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials began to sense that senior leaders in both the Pentagon and the CIA were resistant to the idea of using force. They weren’t wrong, according to a former senior intelligence official and three former administration officials.\n \n\n   \n  Within the administration, CIA Director Gina Haspel was widely known to be opposed to using agency personnel to carry out covert operations against Maduro, those sources said, and at times resisted suggestions from the White House for proposed action. With pressure building from the White House for covert action, there was a lack of consensus at the CIA and at the Pentagon about what would be effective at pressuring Maduro to leave office. The CIA has a long history of interference in Latin American affairs during the Cold War, including failed regime changes, that has created greater reticence from agency leaders.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, the administration coalesced around a strategy to offer diplomatic and economic support to the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, officially recognizing him as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. More than 50 countries would eventually recognize Guaido as the country’s head of state.\n \n\n   \n  “The regime was shaky, and we thought that the opposition had a good chance,” one of the former senior administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  But that effort foundered as it became clear that Guaido had no practical means of actually assuming power in Venezuela.  No massive street protests arose, the military remained loyal to Maduro, and, after a failed coup attempt in the spring of 2019, Guaido remained a president without a government to run.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was “pissed,” according to the former White House official. In his mind, Guaido and the opposition “failed him,” that person and others said — but so had his own government, which had effectively backed a losing horse.\n \n\n   \n    Covert action\n \n\n   \n  The president lost his appetite for focusing on Venezuela during the second half of his second term, following the opposition’s failed coup, according to multiple former administration officials. But Trump had also adopted an even more hawkish view of Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  The desire increased among White House officials for using covert operations and cyberattacks to cause disruptions in Venezuela, and for collecting intelligence on the regime, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Cyber Command, the US military’s offensive and defensive cyber unit, conducted a cyberattack in the latter half of Trump’s first term to interrupt the satellite communications of the Wagner Group, Russian mercenaries who then reportedly had a presence in Venezuela, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military also considered setting up a special team, staffed with Coast Guard personnel, to focus on hacking drug traffickers and collecting intelligence to support US counter-narcotic efforts, according to the sources. The team would have had a heavy Venezuela focus, but concern about legal authorities and bureaucratic hurdles prevented the idea from turning to action.\n \n\n   \n  Other ideas never got off the ground. An administration official proposed knocking a hydroelectric dam in Venezuela offline with a cyberattack, one of the sources said, but the idea seemed half- baked and never made it to the desk of the Pentagon’s cyber operations planners.\n \n\n   \n  The hope was that aggressive covert action could cause enough discomfort and create sufficient disturbances that the military, which has played a critical role in keeping Maduro in power, would be convinced to switch sides and support the opposition, said the former White House official.\n \n\n   \n  But other officials criticized that strategy as lacking solid planning for the day after, the former White House official said — who added that history appears to be repeating itself\n \n\n   \n  “Opposition doesn’t have a plan. We don’t have a plan,” that person said. “Hope is not a plan.”\n \n\n   \n  There were signs that Trump might soften his approach to Venezuela in his second term, according to Story, the former diplomat. Special envoy Richard Grenell has met several times with Maduro to try to secure the release of US citizens wrongfully detained in the country, for example. But in recent months Trump ordered Grenell to stand down, and officials say the Venezuela portfolio is now largely being driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Venezuela hawk.\n \n\n   \n  “Then the hawks took over,” Story said, “so now it’s ‘maximum pressure’ to another level.”\n \n\n   \n  He declined to comment on any covert action.\n \n\n   \n  In the midst of the military buildup, the Trump administration has carried out a series of lethal military strikes against small, go-fast boats including some that have left Venezuelan ports. The Defense Department insists they are trafficking drugs, although it has provided no evidence and Venezuela is not a major producer or transit point for drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  What the administration’s end game is remains unclear. Some, like Story, say that they would be “very surprised” if the US ships in the Caribbean were not “deployed in some way” against the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a force capable of invading the country, but it could potentially be a force capable of doing highly sophisticated rendition of senior leadership in the country,” Story told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump, who rose to power in part through his criticism of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is also keenly aware of the political risks of backtracking on his noninterventionist bona fides. In the end, the former White House official said, the famously mercurial president could find any number of ways to declare “victory” in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “This is wag the dog,” this person said, “This is anything you want it to be.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/china/xi-trump-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:17:00-04:17","title":"Whatever the Xi-Trump meeting is a win for China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the significance of the upcoming face-to-face meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump, scheduled in South Korea, as a pivotal moment in which China seeks to assert its status as an equal global power.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a landmark meeting with Donald Trump expected this week is a moment to showcase something Beijing has long sought: China standing as an equal to the United States on the global stage.\n \n\n   \n  The US president’s trade war against China has challenged Xi’s drive for growth and innovation, but it’s also given Beijing the unintended gift of a bright spotlight under which to flex its economic strength.\n \n\n   \n  As much of the rest of the world scrambled to flatter Trump and negotiate down  global tariffs he unleashed this spring , China fought back with its own measures – until both sides were forced to the table for a truce.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, after US rules hit China’s access to American technology and targeted its shipping industry, Beijing fired back by announcing a  sweeping expansion of export controls  on critical rare earth minerals – a move that rattled Washington and pushed Trump to threaten to pile an additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides have appeared to climb down from that latest escalation following  eleventh-hour trade talks  between top negotiators this weekend in Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  Xi and Trump are now set to meet on the sidelines of an  international summit in South Korea  Thursday – their first face-to-face meeting of Trump’s second term, where they’re expected to agree to a framework for managing their economic ties.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear what each side has agreed to concede to get to that point – and this is just one touchstone in a complex and volatile competition between superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  But it will also be a moment where Xi is entering the room after cementing a new reality in US-China relations: China will negotiate, but it won’t be cowed.\n \n\n   \n    ‘China is very calm’\n \n\n   \n  All that doesn’t mean that the stakes aren’t high for Xi.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of the US and China working together on global threats as a “G2” of the world’s most powerful economies, Beijing sees a US that aims to hinder its rise with tariffs, high-tech export controls and political friction.\n \n\n   \n  Current US tariffs on Chinese goods – which stand at upwards of 50% on average – are putting pressure on the country’s already slowing economy, and those could more than double if the two leaders can’t find common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But as US officials tout Trump’s ability to “create leverage” to pressure China, over on Beijing’s half of the split-screen, China, too, sees success in its strategy.\n \n\n   \n  There, the common sense is that China is ready for this contest: it’s created natural leverage through its strategic dominance over the global rare earths supply chain; it’s diversified trade to become less dependent on the US market and it’s been pushing to accelerate innovation that would allow it to wean off American goods like high-end semi-conductors.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was “fully prepared” for how Trump might act toward China when he started his second term, according to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  “But from the US side, any tariff or any measures taken (by) the Chinese side has helped President Trump himself to learn the capacity of China is different from eight years ago … and he understands that what is changed – is the US is not the dominant power anymore,” Wang said.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing is also continuing its push to insulate itself from future shocks – including in its  upcoming five-year plan , which aims to deepen a top-down drive for tech and industrial self-sufficiency.\n \n\n   \n  “China is very calm in facing all these conflicts and difficulties set up by United States,” Wang Wen, dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies think tank at Renmin University in Beijing, told a gathering of reporters last week in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States is still a major partner, however, among China’s landscape, the US is losing its importance,” Wang added.\n \n\n   \n    Two strongmen\n \n\n   \n  Both sides gave positive signals after trade talks over the weekend, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting Beijing would defer its controls on rare earths, while the US would pull back its 100% tariff threat and extend an earlier tariff truce.\n \n\n   \n  But China has not made such statements, and there’s still a risk that the two strongmen can’t see eye to eye or a rogue comment throws off the delicate detente. And, as is often the case with Trump’s diplomacy, much may come down to the day-of chemistry between the two leaders, who last met in 2019. Such dynamics were on show Tuesday in Japan, where Trump hit it off with the country’s new conservative prime minister,  Sanae Takaishi , and promised that if Japan needed any favors the US would be there.\n \n\n   \n  In his Trump meeting, Xi’s top priorities will be aiming to see the US reduce tariffs and roll back export controls, analysts say. To make that happen, he may be willing to ease or defer China’s latest export controls on rare earths.\n \n\n   \n  China imposed those controls to “coerce the US to not put sweeping sanctions on China,” but rather to limit its sanctions to a “very few national security fields,” said Shanghai-based foreign affairs analyst Shen Dingli.\n \n\n   \n  Whether that works in practice will be put to the test Thursday in a meeting where Beijing is hoping Trump will treat Xi with the kind of respect and warmth for the Chinese leader that he’s professed in recent months and on the campaign trail.\n \n\n   \n  China’s top diplomat Wang Yi gave a subtle reminder of that in a call with his US counterpart Marco Rubio on Monday evening.\n \n\n   \n  Xi and Trump were “both world-class leaders, who have engaged with each other over a long period and with mutual respect,” Wang said, according to a readout. “Upholding the spirit of equality, respect, and mutual benefit,” he added, was a key condition for “moving the bilateral relationship forward.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/air-traffic-control-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"The future of air traffic control grows more uncertain as the federal government shutdown continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing federal government shutdown has severely impacted the U.S. air traffic control system by depriving controllers of pay while requiring them to show up for work.

grows more uncertain as the federal government shutdown continues \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The impact of the federal government shutdown on the air traffic control system in the United States could linger on well beyond the reopening of the government.\n \n\n   \n  From safety redundancies and modernization efforts to training future controllers and keeping the best staff, much of the work of the Federal Aviation Administration could see long term harms from the shutdown, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no question that the shutdown will only set us backwards,” said Erik Hansen, senior vice president and head of government relations for the US Travel Association. “The real risk is that it will do irreparable harm to our efforts to hire more air traffic controllers and to modernize air traffic control.”\n \n\n   \n  When the current staff of 14,000 air traffic controllers looked at their bank accounts on payday this week, there was nothing deposited.\n \n\n   \n  Controllers are required to show up for their job during the government shutdown but are not being paid. A zero-dollar paystub was processed for every controller on Tuesday, the first in the nearly 30-day shutdown period, with no clear end in sight.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been clear to air traffic controllers; they need to show up for work,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news conference Tuesday. “They do really important work for our country, and they need to show up. But I’m not going to lie to anybody to not say that they’re not feeling the stress.”\n \n\n   \n  Some controllers are left with no choice but to accumulate debt or make difficult financial decisions to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  “We make the impossible look possible every single day, but now with the shutdown, we’re making the impossible impossible for people to continue to live without money,” Nick Daniels, the president of the National Association of Air Traffic Controllers said this month. “Instead of focusing on the safety of the American flying public, they’re now focusing on what they can’t afford to pay.”\n \n\n   \n    Every day of the shutdown is ‘less safe’\n \n\n   \n  Transportation officials and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association have warned of the risks to the controller workforce if the shutdown persists. Many cite the struggles the financial strain can take on controller focus, which can hinder aviation safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Air traffic controllers are showing up to work, but we’re being put in a position that every day that this is less safe,” Daniels, said Tuesday. “I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, how do I pay my rent? Rent is due in a few days, how to put food on the table, how to put gas in my car just to show up to work. And those are levels of safety that are being reduced in the system, and the flying public doesn’t deserve that.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘They should never get off a night shift and then go wait tables’\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of the shutdown, the Department of Transportation and Duffy have said controllers were considering taking second jobs to make ends meet in the event of no pay. Duffy previously cited controllers talking about driving for rideshare companies like Uber or delivering food on DoorDash to pay bills.\n \n\n   \n  It’s something that Daniels, whose union represents nearly 20,000 controllers and other aviation workers, said should never happen.\n \n\n   \n  “(Controllers) should never work a side job,” Daniels said. “They should never get off a night shift and then go wait tables and then go move the commerce and people through this airspace.”\n \n\n   \n  That “pressure is real,” controller Joe Segretto, who handles flights approaching and departing New York, said Tuesday at a news conference at LaGuardia airport.\n \n\n   \n  “Somebody came to me and said… ‘I need your advice. What am I to do? Do I put gas in my car? Do I put food on the table We don’t have money for daycare. What do I do?’ I didn’t have the answers,” Segretto said.\n \n\n   \n  “Almost every controller… can’t make it without two paychecks,” Duffy said, noting the situation will only get worse.\n \n\n   \n    Short circuiting supercharged hiring and new technology\n \n\n   \n  The air traffic control system has been short thousands of controllers for years.   \n \n\n   \n  At the beginning of the year, Duffy announced plans to “supercharge” hiring at the FAA, which came with pay bumps and a streamlined hiring processes.\n \n\n   \n  In September, before the shutdown, the DOT said it met its hiring goals for the year by recruiting more than 2,000 people to combat the shortage. The FAA’s air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City was the “busiest” it has ever been,  an FAA official told CNN in July,  with roughly 800 to 1,000 more trainees in the pipeline than a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  But now, some long-sought after trainees are leaving to pursue careers with more financial stability.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an air traffic controller today and you’ve gone through the financial hardship of a shutdown, you’re going to be looking for potentially new career paths or other opportunities,” Hansen said.\n \n\n   \n  The funding to pay trainees is also beginning to run out, according to Duffy. Future controllers get stipends to make ends meet as they go through schooling.  If that stops, it “will be cataclysmic for them,” he said. “That money is about to run out, and we’re seeing several of our students drop out of the Academy.”\n \n\n   \n  The DOT also incentivized controllers approaching the mandatory retirement age of 56 to stay on the job earlier this year. A lump sum payment of 20% of the basic pay of a retirement eligible controller was promised for each year they continue to work.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to have a tougher hill to climb to get back to staffing levels that can not only keep the country safe, but keep air travel growing,” Hansen said. “We’re going to have a tougher hill to climb to modernize the system.”\n \n\n   \n  In May, the DOT announced it would replace decades old infrastructure by building an entirely new air traffic control system for $31.5 billion, but the shutdown could hurt that effort as well.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the DOT secured a $12.5 billion “down payment” in Congressional funding to take steps like replacing the decades-old copper wiring with fiberoptic lines.\n \n\n   \n  While that money is still available for the modernization efforts, the DOT has trouble spending some of it due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have the staff in place, because they’ve been furloughed, to actually execute the agreements or do the oversight that’s necessary by federal law for these projects,” Duffy said last week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/style/bruce-springsteen-movie-costume-design","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Dressing Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the making of the biopic 'Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,' which portrays Bruce Springsteen’s formative years and the creation of his seminal 'Nebraska' album in the early 1980s.

Dressing Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen \n       \n  By Nicole Mowbray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:22 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It is fall 1981 and a 31-year-old Bruce Springsteen has just wrapped a wildly successful tour for his latest album, “The River.” But instead of returning to the studio to produce new songs — as was the preference of his label Columbia Records — the musician retreated to a quiet house in Colts Neck, New Jersey, near where he grew up, to rest and recover.\n \n\n   \n  There, intentionally isolated, but unintentionally reliving childhood trauma and subsequent depression, Springsteen ended up self-recording 10 songs that would form his seminal low-fi album “Nebraska.”\n \n\n   \n  This definitive period in the rock star’s life is the background to “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” a new movie directed by filmmaker Scott Cooper, which stars “The Bear’s” Jeremy Allen White as a convincing Springsteen and Jeremy Strong, of “Succession” fame, portraying his longtime manager and friend Jon Landau.\n \n\n   \n  The stylish biopic charts the tumultuous times of Springsteen’s early life and their influence on his music. It doesn’t, however, shy away from examining the singer’s often painful oscillation between indefatigable global rock god and fragile human, and his search for authenticity and belonging when separated from his working class roots.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a dichotomy also conveyed through Springsteen’s clothing — his eminently familiar blue collar ‘Americana’ uniform of Levi’s jeans, leather jackets with the collar popped, plaid flannels, white tanks and boots, which the now 76-year-old can still be seen in today.\n \n\n   \n  In a video interview with CNN, the movie’s costume director Kasia Walicka Maimone (whose CV includes “The Gilded Age,” “Moonrise Kingdom,” and “Capote”) said that she and her team did a lot of prep before their first meeting with Springsteen, who was involved in the production.\n \n\n   \n  “Bruce was pretty involved and it was amazing to spend time with him because, of course, he’s a legend. Many of us on the movie were already big fans,” she said. “The way he can communicate emotion and tell stories that resonate is, to me, like religion. But there was definitely a moment to put the awe aside and say, ‘OK, now we have to become collaborators’.”\n \n\n   \n  But, said Maimone, Springsteen eminently respected the creative process. “What became clear even in the first conversation I had with Bruce was that, even though he was very well photographed at that specific time (1981-1982), there were pieces he loved more than others — his everyday wear was different to items that were used for photoshoots or concerts. We were continuously breaking through the levels of intimacy and discovering those super private moments and pieces that were significant, that meant a lot to him… Those are what we tried to reflect in the movie, so Bruce’s input was key.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, some of the garments White wears in the film are borrowed from Springsteen’s actual wardrobe, including a Triumph Motorcycles T-shirt and an original blue and white plaid shirt from the early 1980s that the star had often worn. “That was one of Bruce’s beloved pieces, and it was very delicate,” Maimone said. “We knew that it might shred during filming, not least because Jeremy Allen White and Bruce Springsteen are not the same size. But we all wanted so much to use it in an emotional scene with Bruce and his father, and Bruce felt that if the piece were to shred, that particular scene would be the most beautiful moment for it to go.”\n \n\n   \n    The personal is political\n \n\n   \n  Very few rock stars’ wardrobes stand the test of time. Even fewer keep that up over a 50-year career. Yet 45 years on from “Nebraska,” the one they call “The Boss” remains one of the world’s greatest music icons with an almost unchanged personal style, having sold more than 140 million records, winning 20 Grammy awards and earning a billion-dollar fortune along the way.\n \n\n   \n  Part of Springsteen’s visual legend comes from the fact that everything he wears — the denim, the leather jackets, the flannel shirts — is easily accessible to his fans. “Around that time (the early 1980s), Bruce Springsteen was universally appealing. Men wanted to be him and women wanted to date him,” said Patricia Mears, deputy director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, in a phone call. “He’s not consciously stylish, but he is authentically working class, which is where the bulk of his audience is from too. His clothing choices embody the image of a man who does ‘a proper day’s work,’ which is an idea that would appeal to his fanbase.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s a look also tied up in personal politics and patriotism — take, for instance, the worn Levis, faded baseball cap and overall red, white and blue theme on the cover of 1984’s “Born In The USA” album. Springsteen has also stayed true to his left-leaning roots despite global fame. “He supports workers, never comes across as being elitist and threads a very narrow channel of managing to still appeal to his working class base — many of whom have probably supported Donald Trump — without doing the same,” added Mears.\n \n\n   \n  Nancy Deihl, a fashion historian and chair of New York University’s art department, who grew up in New Jersey, said Springsteen and his style was known to her and her friends before he was known to the rest of the world. “I recall a multi-generational conversation held over a holiday dinner,” Deihl explained in a phone call. “The parents all said Bruce Springsteen’s clothes made him look so grubby. They were used to polished performers like Frank Sinatra or Tom Jones. They read his working class style — the bandanas, the jeans — as alternative, as his ‘having not tried hard enough’.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Deihl sees Springsteen’s workwear style as “a signifier of socio-economics; basic, usable items in fabrics such as denim and flannel,” she explained. “These associations not only echo the messaging of his music, they don’t date.”\n \n\n   \n    How he wears what he wears\n \n\n   \n  Springsteen was also a harbinger of the rise of workwear within fashion more broadly, said Mears. “Today, workwear is commonly repurposed as fashion — think Carhartt and Dickies — and performative hipsters channel that authenticity with, sometimes, limited success. But the way Springsteen did it is not hackneyed. His connection to American roots and American roots music authenticated him to dress in this way.”\n \n\n   \n  To create a believable image in the film, it was important for Maimone to channel how Springsteen wears clothes as much as source the correct garments themselves. “Bruce has fantastic style naturally, but he also gives clothes charisma,” she said. “He wore utilitarian workwear pieces in a very specific way — the super tight, high-waisted jeans, Cuban-heeled boots, leather jackets that fit exactly… Bruce’s proportions are perfectly balanced and he wears pieces with a level of ease and confidence. The same item on somebody else might look very different. My job was to capture that ease and confidence.”\n \n\n   \n  Maimone said she and the costuming team spent a long time with White when he was “absorbing” Springsteen, referencing old photographs, period vintage pieces they’d spent months sourcing and the insights from Springsteen himself.\n \n\n   \n  “Jeremy was becoming, you know, the channeler of Bruce Springsteen’s spirit,” said Maimone. “He did it so beautifully and he became him in the most phenomenal way. And it translated to the way he wore those pieces. We sometimes liken a movie’s clothing to another ‘skin,’ another level of the character. And Jeremy ‘absorbed’ the skin of Bruce Springsteen.”\n \n\n   \n  The man himself agrees. “Jeremy didn’t try to do any sort of impression. He simply inhabited my inner life,” said Springsteen in the movie’s notes. “The camera picked up on those complexities and that was essential in making the character completely believable. That’s where he’s performing his magic from, and he just did a beautiful job of it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/health/viral-infections-heart-disease-risk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Common viral infections like flu and shingles can raise your risk of heart attack and stroke, analysis finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Heart Association finds that viral infections—including influenza, COVID-19, HIV, hepatitis C, and shingles—significantly increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and coronary heart disease.

finds \n       \n  By Asuka Koda, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Covid-19 infections have been  strongly linked  with cardiovascular conditions   like heart disease and stroke, but new research shows that other viral infections such as influenza, HIV, hepatitis C and shingles can also increase the risk of heart problems and cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  The meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, reviewed 155 studies spanning decades and found that viral infections can raise the risk of heart disease both immediately after an infection and over the long term.\n \n\n   \n  People who caught the flu were up to six times more likely to have a heart attack in the month after the infection, and those who had Covid-19 had nearly twice the risk of developing heart disease or stroke compared with people who hadn’t been infected.\n \n\n   \n  “One way to prevent this is really vaccination,” said lead study author Dr. Kosuke Kawai, an adjunct professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Often, we get vaccinated to reduce the risk of influenza or other illness, but I think vaccines can provide additional benefit in terms of potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease.”\n \n\n   \n  The authors of the new research concluded that influenza and Covid-19 infections were associated with higher risk of acute cardiovascular events such as heart attacks. Chronic viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis C and shingles were associated with a long-­term increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.\n \n\n   \n  The new study also notes that cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, hepatitis A, human papillomavirus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and chikungunya have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but it says more research on the association is needed.\n \n\n   \n    How does a virus affect the heart?\n \n\n   \n  The new findings fit with what clinicians have long observed, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, many infections can do this,” he said. “Respiratory viruses increase cardiovascular risk in two ways”: indirectly, by triggering an overactive immune response that causes inflammation, leading to stress and blood clotting that affects the heart; or directly, when the virus can attack heart tissue itself.\n \n\n   \n  Most respiratory viruses, including Covid-19, flu and RSV, act through the indirect pathway, Roberts said, while enterovirus strains – related to the viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease – can directly infect the heart muscle.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the more severe the viral illness, the greater the risk of cardiovascular complications,” he said. These infections can also worsen existing heart problems like heart failure, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Kawai said it’s hard to quantify how likely it is for someone with a viral infection to develop cardiovascular disease, so everyone should take protective measures.\n \n\n   \n  “It also depends on the viral infection,” Kawai said. “It’s not just the patients who have underlying increased risk for cardiovascular disease that might be at greater risk, but those who are younger adults, or people who might not necessarily have some of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, are also at increased risk” after a viral infection.\n \n\n   \n    Prevention is key\n \n\n   \n  “Our study highlights the importance of integrated preventive measures, especially for adults with traditional risk factors for [cardiovascular disease]. Vaccines may play an important role in preventing the risk of CVD,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  They concluded that preventive measures such as vaccination and timely antiviral treatment could help reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, which remains the world’s leading cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  “Vaccines for many of these viruses exist and generally lessen the risk of cardiovascular events after infection, since the severe infection is more likely to be mild in a vaccinated individual,” Roberts said.\n \n\n   \n  In people who have a healthy immune system, vaccines are protective without causing cardiovascular disease because they typically contain a small amount of an inactivated virus or specific subunits from the pathogen, Kawai said. The inactivated virus does not trigger an overactive immune response that causes inflammation that affects the heart, nor is it able to attack heart tissues themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who is concerned about the risk of heart problems after an infection should talk with their doctor, Roberts advises.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-dames-moore-regan-rehnquist-roberts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"William Rehnquist, his clerk John Roberts and the Supreme Court precedent at the center of Trump’s tariffs case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is set to hear a high-stakes appeal from President Donald Trump over his tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China, which the administration claims are justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as a 'bargaining chip' to combat drug trafficking and trade deficits.

But when the Supreme Court hears his appeal next week, it may be influenced by a forceful dissenting opinion that highlighted a 1981 case from the Iranian hostage crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Justice John Roberts knows that case well. He helped produce it, as a 26-year-old law clerk to then-Justice William Rehnquist.\n \n\n   \n  Rehnquist wrote the opinion in  Dames & Moore v. Regan  during a hectic week that June – a “mad scramble,” Rehnquist told his fellow justices in a memo. He caught viral pneumonia in the middle of writing the opinion. Roberts himself was in the last frantic days of his clerkship and trying to study for an upcoming bar exam.\n \n\n   \n  The case tested financial aspects of a deal struck by President Jimmy Carter to use frozen Iranian assets as a “bargaining chip” to  win the release of 52 American hostages . Among the laws Carter invoked was the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump is now citing to justify certain tariffs, including on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China.\n \n\n   \n  The Constitution gives Congress the power to set tariffs, and while IEEPA, which was passed in 1977, has previously been used to impose economic penalties, it was never used for tariffs. The law authorizes the president to “regulate … importation” of goods to deal with a national emergency arising from an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the US.\n \n\n   \n  A seven-justice majority of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  rejected the Trump administration’s arguments  in August, finding that while IEEPA gives the president authority for many kinds of actions in response to a national emergency, the disputed tariffs exceed that authority.\n \n\n   \n  But dissenting Judge Richard Taranto, joined by three other judges, countered that the Supreme Court has recognized “broad authority” for the president within IEEPA’s power to “regulate.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto  highlighted the Dames & Moore case . “There, the Court held that IEEPA authorized the President to take action involving Iranian assets as leverage to solve a problem based on Iran’s holding of American hostages,” Taranto wrote. “The Supreme Court blessed the measure as a ‘bargaining chip to be used by the President when dealing with a hostile country.’ Similarly, here, the tariffs are to be a ‘bargaining chip’ to get Canada, Mexico, and China to take more action regarding the criminal trafficking identified in the executive orders.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has embraced Taranto’s arguments as part of its appeal to the Supreme Court defending the tariffs that have brought the US treasury billions of dollars but raised consumer prices and caused widespread economic upheaval.\n \n\n   \n    An urgent, end-of-term, case\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  Roberts, who declined CNN’s request for comment on this story, was just finishing his year-long clerkship in Rehnquist’s chambers when Dames & Moore v. Regan landed. (The justices typically hand down all their opinions for the session by the end of June.)\n \n\n   \n  Rehnquist, appointed in 1972 by President Richard Nixon, was serving as an associate justice at the time. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the chief justice spot; Roberts succeeded Rehnquist in 2005.\n \n\n   \n  The hostage deal negotiated by Carter and endorsed by his successor Reagan required court orders involving frozen Iranian assets to be nullified and transferred to an international tribunal. Dames & Moore, an engineering firm that had won an earlier judgment against Iran, brought a lawsuit against the US Department of Treasury when its judgment was voided as part of the deal. (Donald Regan was Treasury Secretary at the time.)\n \n\n   \n  A US district court dismissed the claim, and Dames & Moore petitioned the Supreme Court in early June 1981 to quickly resolve the matter, because the assets were set to be transferred in mid-July.\n \n\n   \n  When the Dames & Moore petition came in, the justices considered it in a private vote on June 11. Rehnquist, at this initial stage, wanted to reject it and let the US district court order favoring the government stand.\n \n\n   \n  But he and another justice who apparently felt the court was being “stampeded” were outvoted, according to materials reviewed by CNN from the archives of Rehnquist and other justices. The majority believed the court had an institutional obligation to swiftly resolve the case, and oral arguments were held on June 24 as the justices were already moving at a frenzied pace to finish writing their final opinions of the term.\n \n\n   \n  After two hours of courtroom arguments, the justices took their customary private vote and had immediate unanimity to affirm the lower court and uphold the deal. The nine, however, varied in their reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Chief Justice Warren Burger tapped Rehnquist, known for his speed and ability to juggle multiple demands, to craft the opinion for the court. Burger wrote to the others: “To ‘get the show on the road’ Bill Rehnquist has agreed to get an opinion in our hands by noon Sunday, next – if not before.”\n \n\n   \n  According to handwritten notes in his archive at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, Rehnquist broke down the various issues (IEEPA, the Hostage Act, relevant precedent) and detailed the sentiment of his colleagues by their initials. Working with Roberts and two other clerks, Rehnquist produced the first draft within two days and sent it around to the other justices that Friday.\n \n\n   \n  As happens in negotiations over any case, various justices wanted amendments. Rehnquist was accommodating but also mindful of the impending deadline, telling his colleagues in a note, “we are in something of a mad scramble right now, trying to tailor the opinion to the votes taken….”\n \n\n   \n  They finished the decision for public release on July 2. Reviewing the history of IEEPA and an earlier law it replaced, Rehnquist wrote that Carter had acted within the authority granted by Congress as he dealt with the Iranian financial claims.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the distinct nature of the case and the rushed consideration prompted Rehnquist to warn at the outset of the court’s opinion, “We attempt to lay down no general ‘guidelines’ covering other situations not involved here, and attempt to confine the opinion only to the very questions necessary to decision of the case.”\n \n\n   \n    What does Dames & Moore actually mean?\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  The interpretation of Dames & Moore is one of many questions before the current justices on their own expedited, but not as rushed, schedule. One consideration will be whether Trump’s move  violates a relatively new court doctrine  that dictates that when the president takes steps of vast “economic and political significance,” clear congressional authorization is required for those steps.\n \n\n   \n  On the core question of the breadth of IEEPA’s coverage, Trump’s legal team has drawn on Taranto’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “As Judge Taranto explained, ‘IEEPA embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm,’” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote, defending the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Regarding the national threat, Sauer said tariffs were imposed “to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stop the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders.”\n \n\n   \n  But the tariff challengers contend in their filings that the administration is misreading Dames & Moore.\n \n\n   \n  Michael McConnell, lead counsel for wine importer VOS Selections, tells the justices the case stands for the opposite of what the administration argues. He said it advises judges, in fact, to pay “close attention to the IEEPA’s text and established practice,” which would disallow “an unprecedented, worldwide tariff regime.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the many outside organizations siding with the challengers is a group of economists who say even if the IEEPA allowed for the imposition of tariffs, there is no real emergency to address.\n \n\n   \n  Trade deficits “have existed consistently over the past fifty years in the United States …” the  group writes . “They are thus not ‘unusual and extraordinary’ but rather ordinary and commonplace.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, but he is widely recognized as non-ideological on the specialized Federal Circuit court that resolves international trade, patent and trademark disputes.\n \n\n   \n  The judge is also known to many of the justices, having taken a similar path to the bench. Three years after Roberts clerked for Rehnquist, Taranto served in the chambers of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. Taranto also argued often before the high court, as an assistant US solicitor general and then as a lawyer in private practice before his 2013 appointment.\n \n\n   \n    One last test\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  Back on July 2, 1981, after Rehnquist and his clerks had finished the opinion, Justice William Brennan, the senior liberal, sent Rehnquist a note, with copies all around: “Congratulations again upon a truly splendid job. I’m happy to join.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Lewis Powell quickly began drafting a similar note of appreciation. Materials in his files show that Powell first addressed only the effort of Rehnquist: “I join in thanking and congratulating you on a super accomplishment.” Powell added a handwritten change to be typed up: “congratulating you –  and your Chambers  – on a super accomplishment … ”\n \n\n   \n  The finished decision was not without some personal cost. Rehnquist caught viral pneumonia and ended up in the emergency room just as he was finishing the opinion. He quickly recovered but faced other obstacles as he was trying to fly to Vermont for a scheduled family vacation.\n \n\n   \n  “Meanwhile,” Rehnquist wrote on July 2 to his fellow justices, “I find that I lost my wallet at the Bethesda Hospital Emergency Room on Sunday, and have become virtually a ’stateless’ person. Yesterday I got a temporary driver’s license, but that has to be converted into a regular duplicate by Monday or all of my driving will be illegal.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Roberts tried to catch up on his studies for the bar exam that month and prepare for a job in the Reagan administration beginning in August.\n \n\n   \n  His study partner for the District of Columbia bar exam happened to be a fellow clerk, from the Brennan chambers that term: McConnell, now the lead counsel suing Trump over the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Both men  passed .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/sport/ncaa-delays-athlete-gambling-rule-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-04:00","title":"NCAA Delays Rule Change Permitting College Athletes to Bet on Professional Sports","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA has delayed its rule change that would allow college athletes and athletic staff to place bets on professional sports, postponing the effective date from November 1 to November 22.

spoken with Trump about ‘the constrictions of the Constitution’ on a third term \n       \n  By Veronica Stracqualursi, Annie Grayer, Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday said he has spoken with Donald Trump about the possibility of the president seeking a third-term but that he sees no path for it as any change to the US Constitution would be well after Trump has left office.\n \n\n   \n  “Well, there’s the 22nd Amendment,” Johnson, who is a constitutional lawyer, said in response to a question about his comfort-level with the president floating a 2028 bid.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a great run. But I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about, the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The president, he said, is trolling members of the other party when he talks publicly about the topic.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that’s ever been produced. And he has a good time with that, trolling the Democrats, whose hair is on fire about the very prospect,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican leader’s acknowledgment that he and Trump have discussed issues surrounding a third-term adds credence to warnings from the president’s opponents that he is seriously flirting with upending the Constitution. But Johnson’s quickly throwing cold water on the suggestion underscores how little support Trump would have if he actually tried to move forward with it.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said he had spoken with Trump Tuesday morning while the president is overseas in Japan, but he did not specify when the pair had discussed the Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Amending the Constitution, he noted, would be a lengthy and arduous process, saying, “I don’t see a way to amend the Constitution, because it takes about 10 years to do that, as you all know, to allow all the states to ratify … what two-thirds of the House, three-fourth of the states would approve. So I don’t, I don’t see the path for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Monday  continued to entertain  the idea of running for a third term, telling reporters that he’d “love to do it,” while also floating the possibility of a Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio pairing in 2028. But he did rule out one proposed end-run around the Constitution, saying it would be “too cute” for him to run as vice president in order to later ascend back into the White House after the elected president resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the people wouldn’t like that because it’s too cute. It’s not — it wouldn’t be right,” he said, although he tried to reserve the legal right to do it.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to South Korea Wednesday morning local time, Trump said, “Based on what I read, I guess I’m not allowed to run, so we’ll see what happens.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump added: “I would say that if you read it, [the Constitution] it’s pretty clear, I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad. But we have a lot of great people.”\n \n\n   \n  At the White House, Trump has joked about running for a third term and  Trump 2028 hats  are on display in a room near the Oval Office. Recently, Trump posted images of the ’28 hats on the Resolute Desk when the House and Senate minority leaders, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, came to the Oval Office. But some people close to the president say that inside the administration, a third term is not viewed as something he is seriously considering or planning to do.\n \n\n   \n  The idea of running for a third term is “like catnip” for the media and Democrats, Trump’s allies argue, ginning up the type of attention the president enjoys, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  That attention intensified last week when The Economist published an interview with Steve Bannon, a MAGA influencer and former Trump adviser, who claimed “there is a plan” for Trump to run for a third term. Bannon is notably far less close to the president and his team than he was during Trump’s first term, and some White House officials viewed his comments as an attempt to draw attention to himself. But the seemingly outlandish ideas of Trump and people in his orbit sometimes find their way to reality.\n \n\n   \n  The sources insisted Trump isn’t actually plotting a 2028 campaign. That is not only because it would take a Constitutional amendment to make it legal, but the president is also aware of his age and cares deeply about his legacy. People close to him argue he never wants to be viewed like former President Joe Biden, whose age and health became a fixture of his presidency. If Trump were to take office again for a third term, he would be 82 years old.\n \n\n   \n  “He said publicly he’s not gonna do a third term. Anytime it comes up, it’s Trump being Trump. He’s going to do the ‘Many people would love that!’ thing,” a person close to Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  They also argued the president doesn’t like to point out that he only has three years left, trying to swat away any talk of him being a lame duck president.\n \n\n   \n  The person close to the president argued that not only is Trump “not seriously thinking about 2028, no one is seriously thinking about it right now,” including people that Trump has hinted could succeed him, like Vance and Rubio.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s something we all expect to play more of a role come the midterms,” they said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/trump-military-speech-japan-hegseth-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Why Trump’s growing politicization of the military could backfire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is increasingly politicizing the U.S. military, using platforms such as the USS George Washington and Fort Bragg to deliver partisan speeches and propose deploying National Guard and active-duty troops into U.S. cities for immigration and crime enforcement.

Not much in the mind of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The commander in chief used a speech on the USS George Washington, moored in Japan Tuesday, to  revive 2020 election falsehoods  and to campaign for his constitutionally questionable plan to send troops into US cities.\n \n\n   \n  Once, such political activity using the military as a backdrop would have provoked shock back home. But Trump has infringed so many customs of the presidency that it came as no surprise.\n \n\n   \n  The president recently had service members cheering a  deeply partisan speech  at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, that troubled many former senior officers. He staged a  parade through Washington  to mark the  Army’s 250th anniversary  — which coincided with his birthday. He rambled in a speech before top brass flown from around the globe in Virginia last month. The generals and admirals were also treated to an anti-“woke” screed from  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth . Most notoriously, in his first term, Trump enlisted Gen. Mark Milley to march with him after demonstrators were cleared from outside the White House. The then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  apologized for being pulled into domestic politics  and landed on Trump’s forever enemies list.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made a spectacular entrance Tuesday before hundreds of sailors and service personnel, descending on a huge elevator with military jets as a backdrop. His speech on the USS George Washington was a classic weave. He claimed to have dreamed of being an admiral and indulged his obsession about the best way to power catapults that carriers use to launch their warplanes into the sky.\n \n\n   \n  But he also touched on fiercely political issues in front of nonpartisan officers and enlisted personnel, previewing an expansion of his effort to  send troops into US cities  in a constitutionally questionable  crime and immigration purge .\n \n\n   \n  “We have cities that are troubled. We can’t have cities that are troubled and we are sending in our National Guard,” Trump said. “And if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard because we’re going to have safe cities. We’re not going to have people killed in our cities. And whether people like that or not, that’s what we’re doing,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  The timing of his threat to use American troops against Americans was jarring. It came two days before he’s due to meet in South Korea with President Xi Jinping, head of the Chinese Communist Party, which turned its military on its own people to break up the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plans bear no comparison to that historic outrage. But the symbolism of his efforts to use the military to bolster his own strongman image is clear.\n \n\n   \n    The military isn’t immune from politics — but tries to avoid them\n \n\n   \n  So far in his second term, Trump has deployed the National Guard to protect federal facilities in Los Angeles; Chicago; and Portland, Oregon, triggering multiple court cases and challenging laws that prevent the deployment of troops on US soil in a law enforcement capacity. He has used reserve troops to back crime crackdowns in Memphis, Tennessee, and Washington, DC. Last week, the president shelved a plan to send troops into San Francisco after an intervention by top tech industry executives. Trump’s critics argue, and some judges have ruled, that he’s exaggerated conditions in US cities and exceeded his powers under the same Constitution that serving members of the military take an oath to uphold.\n \n\n   \n  Every president loves to be cheered by the troops where voters will see. But most take pains not to subject service members to uncomfortable political positions. Trump’s presidency, however, is a lesson in trampling decorum. His flouting of convention is one reason he’s so popular among his MAGA fans.\n \n\n   \n  There are sound reasons for presidents to try to avoid politicizing the military. The integrity of a civilian-led volunteer force depends on not being seen as a tool of either party. This apolitical shield protects personnel as well as Pentagon budget requests, which often benefit from bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Many in Trump’s military audiences might share his politics. But US security depends on them saluting whoever is commander in chief in future.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, the military isn’t immune from politics. It reflects society, so divisive issues like health care for LGBTQ members or racial and gender equality always ripple through the ranks. Trump’s team came to office determined to reverse what they claimed was a progressive slide.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth slashed diversity, equity and inclusion programs and loosened rules of combat designed to protect civilians. He  ordered trans people out  of the forces, has questioned  the fitness of women for active service  and relieved  high-ranking officers  of their duties — several of whom are minorities.\n \n\n   \n  “This administration has done a great deal from day one to remove the social justice, politically correct, and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department, to rip out the politics,” Hegseth told the senior officers at Quantico, Virginia, last month. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship. No more division, distraction or gender delusions.”\n \n\n   \n  It would be hard to find a more politicized speech from a defense secretary. Senior officers sat in silence, observing regulations that bar them taking part in political activity or partisan campaigning.\n \n\n   \n    Presidents always walk a fine political line with the military\n \n\n   \n  Trump is not the first president to be accused of politicizing the military. Some Republicans  argued  that former President Bill Clinton launched air strikes in Iraq to distract from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Democrats believed President George W. Bush’s pre-war speeches to troops were a politicized campaign for what they saw as an illegal invasion of Iraq. In 2022, Republicans  criticized President Joe Biden  for having two Marines flank him during a speech in Philadelphia, in which he branded Trump a threat to “equality and democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President’s use of active duty Marines as political props undermines the apolitical nature of our servicemembers and erodes trust in our military,” several GOP lawmakers  wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin  at the time.\n \n\n   \n  In his nearly 10 months back in office, Trump has staged far greater transgressions — but, as is often the case, faced no Republican blowback.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/threatened-synagogue-attacks-alabama","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-04:00","title":"Man Arrested with Body Armor and Ammunition After Threatening Multiple Synagogues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 33-year-old man named Jeremy Wayne Shoemaker was arrested in Alabama after threatening attacks on synagogues in Alabama and surrounding states.

   12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump sits down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week,  trade will be the subject at hand .\n \n\n   \n  But it is also an opportunity for something else: a chance to secure the release of US citizens detained by the People’s Republic.\n \n\n   \n  More Americans are thought to be imprisoned in China, some 200 in total, than in any other country,  according to the Foley Foundation,  which advocates for American hostages and those wrongfully detained overseas. Most are believed to be ethnically Chinese Americans who have been ensnared by Beijing’s strict security apparatus and detained for posing a threat to China’s “national security.”\n \n\n   \n  A smaller number are jailed for breaking local laws, sometimes unwittingly.\n \n\n   \n  A campaign to free two Americans jailed for more than a decade after falling victim to scams has gathered steam following months of advocacy, reaching high into the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  In May, the State Department issued a request for the release of Dawn Michelle Hunt and Nelson Wells Jr. on humanitarian grounds. Last month, a bipartisan bill named for the pair was put forward in the House to expand diplomatic advocacy on behalf of Americans held in China.\n \n\n   \n  And in a letter sent last week to the White House, Republican lawmakers urged Trump to raise their cases and those of others as part of trade talks with Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\n \n\n   \n  The last-minute lobbying effort comes amid what officials, campaigners and the families of Hunt and Wells say is the best opportunity to secure their release — before it’s too late. Both detainees are ill. Though they have access to some health care, their families say they will not survive much longer in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Tim Hunt saw his sister Dawn Michelle last summer for the first time in a decade from behind the glass partition of a visiting booth in a Chinese prison, under the watchful eye of minders who sat not 2 yards away.\n \n\n   \n  Her hair was so thin, so gray, he recalled. “I’m oldest of three,” he said, so it was like he had helped raise her. “So I know every facial expression” — the pain, the anger, the change etched into her features.\n \n\n   \n  “I told her before I left — I’m like, ‘This is not your existence. I will get you out of here,’” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has often claimed that he is uniquely capable of striking deals no one can, and that releasing American from foreign jails is a top priority. \n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, the administration has touted the return of a Chinese American  Wells Fargo executive  and called for the release of a prominent Christian leader whose children are American citizens.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates say that winning the releases of Hunt and Wells would not only send a message that Trump cares about the issue of detentions abroad, but could also set a wider precedent for securing the release of other Americans considered unjustly held in China.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not rich, we’re not superstars, we’re not politically connected; we’re just regular people,” Wells’ father, Nelson Wells Sr., told CNN. “If President Trump would stand up for regular people, this would make a statement to the United States of America that he cares.”\n \n\n   \n  Besides Hunt and Wells, eight other cases, including those of detained Chinese and Uyghur Americans, are raised in the letter to Trump.\n \n\n   \n   “ This is something the president and the secretary of state, they should be leading off with this every time they talk to Xi Jinping , ” said Republican Rep. Chris Smith, one of the letter’s co-authors.\n \n\n   \n  “So [that’s] another reason why we need this… [so] Xi Jinping and his hierarchy there see that the Congress and the president are very serious about letting Americans go . ” \n \n\n   \n    Families in the dark\n \n\n   \n  Hunt has been imprisoned in China for 11 years after falling victim to a drug-trafficking scam in 2014. She thought she had won a trip to Australia after entering an online contest in 2014, and as part of her “prize,” her flight had layovers in Hong Kong and China, where she was treated to a hotel stay and given luxury handbags.\n \n\n   \n  The bags turned out to be lined with methamphetamine, discovered when she attempted to clear customs for the next leg of her flight. Like Hunt, Wells Jr. said he was also duped in 2014 into transporting gifts that turned out to be cover for drugs.\n \n\n   \n  When Americans are detained abroad, their case is typically first handled by the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs and the embassy. If the arrest is believed to be unjust, they may be declared “wrongfully detained.”\n \n\n   \n  The designation, defined under a US law called the Levinson Act and conferred by the secretary of state, allows a government office, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, to handle the case. Options like prisoner exchanges and ministerial lobbying then become more likely to be on the table.\n \n\n   \n  But some families and advocates for foreign detainees say the parameters for invoking the law are murky, and those held under exit bans or convictions like Hunt and Wells Jr. are not labeled wrongfully detained. Though they get visits from State Department representatives, families are often in the dark as to how they might seek recourse.\n \n\n   \n  “The first six years were horrible,” Wells Sr. said, describing plea after plea to lawmakers’ offices seeking help for his son. “A lot of money spent on lawyers, financial burdens, the whole nine yards — it wasn’t worth anything,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, everybody was telling us, ‘Be quiet, don’t say anything, this is going to hurt Nelson more than help him,’” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Public lobbying campaign\n \n\n   \n  Last year the Wells and the Hunt families both decided to begin a public lobbying campaign, appearing before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to testify about their relatives’ cases.\n \n\n   \n  Depending on the level of interest and profile of the detainees, decisions about their release can rise to the highest levels of government, according to people familiar with the process.\n \n\n   \n  “If Trump, in going through a list of things with the Chinese, were to indicate that the release of these two Americans would be viewed favorably in Washington, that would certainly be the way to move things,” said  Michael Kovrig , a Canadian former diplomat and Asia analyst.\n \n\n   \n  Kovrig was once detained as part of what was widely seen as a diplomatic tit-for-tat involving frictions among Washington, Ottawa and Beijing. In 2018, he and another Canadian were arrested and accused of espionage shortly after Canada, at the request of the US Justice Department, detained the Chinese businesswoman  Meng Wanzhou , a Huawei executive, as she was leaving Vancouver. The US had accused Meng of breaching sanctions rules and later charged her with fraud.\n \n\n   \n  In Kovrig’s case, his  release was secured  after then-US President Joe Biden raised it with Xi on a phone call.\n \n\n   \n  In discussing the release of the Wells Fargo executive last month, Adam Boehler, the Trump official who leads the hostage envoy’s office, said, “The president has set the tone and made it very clear.” He added that ministers and diplomats are also “explaining that US policy has changed and that it is a huge negative to hold Americans, and that is best expressed directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The State Department said: “We take our commitment to assist US citizens abroad seriously and are closely monitoring their situation and providing consular assistance.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the National Security Council said: “President Trump has been clear that he wants every American detained abroad to return home.” \n \n\n   \n  Senior administration officials are aware of the Hunt and Wells cases, though, as of last week did not have plans for the issue to be raised Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  But James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer who has advised the families, pointed out that China would have reasons to look favorably on releasing them, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The Chinese do not want American citizens dying in their prison,” Zimmerman said. “It doesn’t look good. ” \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kylie Atwood, Alayna Treene and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/monkeys-escape-from-overturned-truck-in-heidelberg-mississippi","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00-05:00","title":"Monkeys Escape from Overturned Truck on a Mississippi Highway","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rhesus monkeys, which are widely used in medical research and housed at Tulane University's National Biomedical Research Center, escaped from a truck that overturned on Interstate 59 near Heidelberg, Mississippi.

Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age   14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says. He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement shared with CNN Monday that Vijandre posted content on his social media “glorifying terrorism,” and said he supported groups such as the Holy Land Foundation, a former US-based Muslim charity  where five members were convicted  in a contested series of trials on charges of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s filing denies Vijandre   has supported terrorism, and argues his   First and Fifth amendment rights have been violated and the court should order his release and provide injunctive relief to prevent “further unlawful detention.”\n \n\n   \n  One First Amendment expert warned that — though he said his knowledge of the details in this case was limited — the administration’s actions could have far-reaching implications.\n \n\n   \n  “When individuals, whether they’re citizens or not, are physically detained only because of political opinions they’ve expressed, it runs the very serious risk of eroding First Amendment rights for everybody,” David Snyder, the Executive Director at the First Amendment Coalition, a non-profit dedicated to promoting and protecting freedom of expression and the press, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Speech is “plainly protected by the First Amendment”\n \n\n   \n  On the morning of October 7, Vijandre was leaving his home in Arlington, Texas, when ICE agents arrested him while at least one officer pointed a handgun at him, Monday’s filing said.\n \n\n   \n  A Notice of Intent to Terminate DACA dated September 22 was sent   to Vijandre and   found in his mailbox several days after he was detained by ICE, according to the filing.\n \n\n   \n  The notice alleges Vijandre supported “organizations and individuals who are known to engage in acts of terrorism,” which “presents public safety, national security concerns, and is a significant negative discretionary factor under the totality of the circumstances analysis,” Monday’s habeas filing said.\n \n\n   \n  His legal team argues DHS is conflating supporting terrorism with Vijandre’s “opposition to U.S. foreign policy, the policies of the Israeli government, and abuse of prisoners with support for terrorism,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  “In each of the three cases listed above, what Respondents characterize as support for terrorism actually consists of opposing perceived violation of detainee rights, including at black site prisons like Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Air Force Base,” the habeas petition says. “Equating such speech to ‘terrorism’ to justify detention would risk criminalizing a broad array of protected speech critical of U.S. government policy engaged in by citizens and non-citizens alike.”\n \n\n   \n  Even if the speech did support terrorism, “such speech is plainly protected by the First Amendment,” the filing says, and the speech referenced by DHS “unquestionably fails this test regardless of whatever grounds of removability Respondents ultimately charge Mr. Vijandre in his Notice to Appear.”\n \n\n   \n  Vijandre is not charged or convicted of any crime, his attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n    Attempted recruitment by FBI\n \n\n   \n  His detention   also comes after he was approached by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and asked to act as a confidential informant shortly after the Israel-Gaza conflict started in 2023, the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  On or around November 30, 2023, agents approached Vijandre, indicating they wanted to recruit him as a confidential informant, and allegedly said he was “a poster child for the way you’re supposed to do it” in an apparent reference to immigration status, the filing says. He declined the offer, according to the filing.\n \n\n   \n  A form called a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien provided to Vijandre’s attorneys said that he was a “subject of interest to the [FBI’s] Dallas Join (sic) Terrorism Task Force” at an unspecified time, and the FBI initiated a review of his immigration record, the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  His team alleges that his detention is, in part,   retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.\n \n\n   \n    Vijandre’s attorneys ring alarm bells\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys representing Vijandre raised alarm bells   about the implications of their client’s detention, saying in Monday’s filing that “important democratic principles are at stake.”\n \n\n   \n  This is another example in a string of cases this year in which   the Trump administration is aiming to root out any immigrants it views as unpatriotic, and specifically associate those who are pro-Palestinian as being anti-American, said Marium Uddin, an attorney representing Vijandre and Legal Director of the Muslim Legal Fund of America.\n \n\n   \n  They appear to target people expressing dissent, which is disturbing from a legal perspective but also “incredibly scary as a country,” she said, adding that is testing whether our legal systems will stay intact and follow decades of legal precedent.\n \n\n   \n  The legal team is confident based on their review, and believe the Trump administration is looking to expand the definition of domestic terrorism despite their client’s protected speech about   things like ICE enforcement and inhumane detention at places like Guantanamo Bay ,  said attorney Eric Lee.\n \n\n   \n    Detention could be a “frightening violation” of first amendment, attorney says\n \n\n   \n  If Vijandre’s detention   is based purely on his criticism of the government, it could be “a frightening violation of the First Amendment’s protection,” said Snyder of First Amendment Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  He emphasized he doesn’t have all the details in the case as he is not representing Vijandre, but said first and foremost the First Amendment exists to protect “our ability to criticize what the government is doing or not doing.”\n \n\n   \n  This applies to citizen and non-citizens who are on American soil, no matter how long they’ve been present in the country, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s really at the core of why the First Amendment is there, and if what the Trump administration is doing is putting people behind bars, even if only temporarily, because they disagree with their political expression, that’s hugely problematic,” Snyder said.\n \n\n   \n  Speech may not be protected if someone is inciting or directing others to incite violence — and that legal standard requires specific elements such as how specific a threat is, how likely it is to be carried out, and physical proximity to the person or thing being threatened, among other items, Snyder said.\n \n\n   \n  Vijandre’s legal team meticulously analyzed his social media presence and believe the government has failed to come close to satisfying imminent incitement, said Lee.\n \n\n   \n  While some of the facts regarding this case are still unfolding, the implications could be grave, Snyder said.\n \n\n   \n  “If the government establishes that they’re just going to come round you up, take you off the street if you say things that the government disapproves of, and that is the only basis for them taking you off the street, it has a tremendous chilling effect,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very dangerous for the government to behave this way,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/senate-brazil-tariff-vote-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"19:03:00Z","title":"Five Senate Republicans Join Democrats to Rebuke Trump’s Brazil Tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five Republican senators joined Democrats in the U.S. Senate to pass a resolution opposing President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Brazil, citing the misuse of emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Rand Paul, Thom Tillis, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and former Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell sided with Democrats in the 52 to 48 vote.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell has long been critical of Trump’s trade policy, and said in a statement ahead of the vote, “Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.”\n \n\n   \n  The resolution, however, isn’t expected to be taken up by the House. Earlier this year, Republicans in the chamber added a measure to a procedural rule blocking members from being able to force a vote on the president’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution aims to end the  Brazil tariffs  by terminating an emergency declaration from the president.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tim Kaine, the lead sponsor of the resolution, said before the vote that the president’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was not appropriate, considering that the inciting “emergency” that led to the tariffs was Brazil’s indictment of the country’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n \n\n   \n  “The emergency, with respect to Brazil, the unusual and extreme emergency that threatens the United States, that emanates in whole or in part outside the United States, is the Brazilian decision to prosecute Donald Trump’s friend. How is that an emergency?” he said, noting that the US has a trade surplus with Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine added, “I’m against tariffs generally, unless they’re used very specifically. But I’m also against letting presidents just invent a reason to use emergency powers to do all kinds of things without coming to Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s executive order that kicked off the tariffs  said  that “the Government of Brazil’s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters are serious human rights abuses that have undermined the rule of law in Brazil.”\n \n\n   \n  Kaine told reporters earlier Tuesday that senators will also force votes later this week aimed at tariffs on Canada and the global tariffs from Trump’s so-called “liberation day.” Earlier this year, the Senate  voted to adopt  the resolution ending the tariffs on Canada, however, the House did not act.\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia Democrat acknowledged the House will not take up his resolution, and that they don’t have a veto-proof majority backing the measure in the Senate. But he insisted that adopting anti-tariff resolutions will send a strong message to the president.\n \n\n   \n  “I did learn in the, in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,” said Kaine.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/weather/cuba-hurricane-melissa-what-to-expect","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"17:33:00-04:00","title":"Cuba is staring down a direct hit from Melissa.

\n  The White House has fired all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics,” according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The firings come as President Donald Trump has sought to impose his style on the nation’s capital through a slate of  construction projects , including a planned  triumphal arch , new White House ballroom, and paving over the Rose Garden.\n \n\n   \n  The firings came via email from an adviser in the Presidential Personnel Office.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the Commission on Fine Arts is terminated, effective immediately,” reads the email, which was reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The six members were appointed by former President Joe Biden to serve four-year terms. The commission was established by Congress in 1910 “to advise the federal government on matters pertaining to the arts and national symbols, and to guide the architectural development of Washington, D.C.,” according to its website.\n \n\n   \n  The email received by commission members contains similar wording to those that dismissed Biden appointees on other boards and organizations this year, including the National Capital Planning Commission and the  US Holocaust Memorial Council .\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the full-time government employees who work at the Commission of Fine Arts and was informed via email that all staff are furloughed due to the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n   The Washington Post  was first to report on the arts commission firings.\n \n\n   \n  The firings come as Trump is overseeing a  massive overhaul  of the East Wing of the White House that includes a proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom. Trump has estimated the ballroom will cost “about $300 million” and has said it will be funded by himself and  donors .\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear that the Commission of Fine Arts would have any jurisdiction over the ballroom project. Administration  officials determined  the White House would need approval only from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal construction projects in Washington and its neighboring states, Virginia and Maryland, to proceed with the construction of the ballroom where the East Wing once stood .  But officials said the commission has jurisdiction only when “vertical” construction begins, and does not oversee demolition.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently appointed White House staff secretary and loyalist Will Scharf to chair the National Capital Planning Commission, and tapped two other aides to serve on the body. Scharf said during a commission meeting last month that the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  Certain laws and rules regarding building alterations appear not to apply to the White House. The Shipstead-Luce Act of 1930 requires that alterations to buildings in specific areas of the nation’s capital must be presented to the Commission of Fine Arts. The language, however, refers to buildings facing the White House and not the White House itself.\n \n\n   \n  The planned ballroom is just one example of the president bringing his real estate developer roots to the capital. As CNN has previously reported, Trump is considering building a permanent arch in Washington, DC, as part of broader celebrations honoring the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in July. He also  signed  an executive order mandating that all federal buildings embrace classical architecture and discouraging brutalist-style buildings.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/entertainment/lily-allen-tmi-autumn-taylor-swift","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"18:14:00Z","title":"Forget hot girl summer — we’re excited about TMI autumn","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the resurgence of emotionally raw and confessional music, exemplified by Taylor Swift’s song 'Wood' and Lily Allen’s new album 'West End Girl,' which details her breakup with actor David Harbour.

It is unanimously thought to be an agonizingly detailed reflection on her whirlwind marriage to and apparently grisly breakup with her estranged husband, “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to representatives for both Allen and Harbour for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from brandishing her trademark courage to be fundamentally vulnerable, hurt and pissed (in the American sense) on the record, Allen  really   goes there  in the seventh track, titled “Pussy Palace.”\n \n\n   \n  The song, and the album as a whole, notably doesn’t namecheck Harbour. But it does recount a time after Allen and a partner fought — and in the song, she brings   some personal effects to his apartment since she doesn’t want him in her bed.\n \n\n   \n  Upon arriving, she realizes “something don’t feel right,” as she sings, because the space she had previously thought was her partner’s “dojo” was actually his … insert NSFW title of song here.\n \n\n   \n  “So am I looking at a sex addict?” she asks in the chorus, before launching into an extremely confessional second verse that describes a “shoebox full of handwritten letters, from broken-hearted women wishing you could have been better.”\n \n\n   \n  After detailing a messy scene with “sheets pulled off the bed, they’re strewn all on the floor, long black hair, probably from the night before,” Allen sings about a  now-infamous “Duane Reade bag”  with tied handles that’s full of unmentionable intimate objects along with “hundreds of Trojans.”\n \n\n   \n  Allen is here to remind us that when it comes to artistic expression, there really is no such thing as oversharing.\n \n\n   \n  On a simplistic level, the album “West End Girl” feels like an update to Morissette’s jaggedly confessional breakup anthem “You Oughta Know” from exactly three decades ago. This is all light years away from Carly Simon’s mother-of-all-relationship-burns “You’re So Vain” in terms of burn factor, mixing the rawness of an Apple postmortem with the good ol’ resignation of Carole King’s “It’s Too Late.”\n \n\n   \n  As with the breakup music that came before, Allen’s is a reminder that art is at once pain and healing. Her sharing every emotional stop on what we’re led to believe is a train wreck of a separation becomes, in expert hands, a peek into what are extremely relatable moments.\n \n\n   \n  Like, raise your hand if you’ve ever been on either side of the situation she depicts in the song “Tennis,” in which Allen sings of a partner who is protecting the things on his phone he doesn’t want her to see — “then you showed me a photo on Instagram / it was how you grabbed your phone back right out of my hands.”\n \n\n   \n  Look, relationships are hard. But maybe what isn’t so hard for artists like Allen and Swift? Laying it all out on the table, warts and all, for listeners to pick apart and, yes, be totally shocked over.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/us/florida-execution-norman-grim","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"18:36:00Z","title":"Florida man executed for the 1998 rape and murder of his neighbor","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Norman Mearle Grim Jr., 65, was executed in Florida for the 1998 rape and murder of his neighbor Cynthia Campbell, whose body was discovered near the Pensacola Bay Bridge.

Here’s what you need to know \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Bill Kirkos, Andy Rose, Rebekah Riess, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Top Border Patrol chief  Gregory Bovino , who oversees the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, came under the microscope of a federal judge Tuesday after she received reports federal agents were not following her order to  limit aggressive tactics  and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis told Bovino she wants to see him in person every evening for the next week so he can update her on “Operation Midway Blitz” and whether his agents are complying with her order.\n \n\n   \n  The controversial immigration operation has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  But it has also drawn legal challenges from plaintiffs that include protesters, local journalists and clergy members who accuse federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators and unlawfully restricting the press.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis summoned Bovino to testify Tuesday after plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has refuted.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n    Judge allows limited tear gas use, despite concerns of overuse\n \n\n   \n  Even as she expressed concern that agents may not be complying with her order, Ellis declined to fully restrict their use of tear gas, as the plaintiffs had asked her to do.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to tie the agents’ hands because I’m not out there, and that’s not my job,” Ellis said. “But I am going to expect that they know and understand their responsibilities on the use of force.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’ order, which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on protesters unless there is an “immediate threat to safety.” It also requires clear warnings before these methods are used.\n \n\n   \n  During the hearing, the judge went through her order line by line and detailed how agents should comply, including clearly identifying themselves and providing ample warning before deploying gas.\n \n\n   \n  “The warning has to include what it is that you’re going to do, what you’re going to do before you do it, and allow people to comply,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  The judge cited videos that she said appeared to show agents firing gas without notice and with no immediate threat.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino declined to comment on specific instances, saying, “Each situation is dependent on the situation.” But Ellis noted he’s likely to be asked about recent alleged violations of her order during a deposition she’s allowing plaintiff’s attorneys to conduct of him in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis ordered that all use-of-force reports for Operation Midway Blitz from September 2 through last Satur﻿day, along with any body camera footage taken during those interactions, be turned over to the court under seal by the end of this week.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for next week.\n \n\n   \n    Body cameras ‘are your friends’ – but Bovino doesn’t have one\n \n\n   \n  As the Trump administration and protesters provide starkly different pictures of the reality on the ground, Ellis emphasized the importance of agents wearing body cameras to document their interactions with protesters, saying it could actually benefit agents who claim they are being attacked by crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “Cameras are your friends. If you are conducting enforcement activities in the street, and there is a threat, the body-worn camera is going to pick that up. All I have to do is look at the video,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  But Bovino admitted that while the “vast majority” of his agents wear body cameras, he does not wear one himself, even though he participates in operations that fall under the judge’s order.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Ellis told federal officials that agents must wear body cameras and turn them on when interacting with protesters in Chicago. Days later, a Customs and Border Protection commander told Ellis every agent on duty was equipped with a body camera.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like you to do your best to ensure everybody who is under this Midway Blitz operation that they all have body-worn cameras,” Ellis said Tuesday. Bovino told the judge he would work to get a camera for himself by Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the hearing, Ellis said videos she had seen did not show justification for use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s difficult for me to see that the force being used is necessary to stop an immediate and serious threat of harm to a person,” Ellis told Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs allege Bovino can be seen in an October 23  video  throwing a tear gas canister into a crowd. The Department of Homeland Security  said  Bovino was hit in the head beforehand, but that was not visible in publicly released  videos .\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reviewed video released by DHS on Tuesday, which shows at least one object thrown near Bovino. It also shows at least a couple of people throwing objects. The video does not appear to show Bovino being struck in the head by an object.\n \n\n   \n  In an online  post , the agency said, “Border Patrol agents repeated multiple warnings to back up and that chemical agents would be deployed if warnings were ignored. Riot control measures were deployed, including by Chief Bovino, and arrests were made.”\n \n\n   \n    A community’s sense of safety is ‘shattered,’ judge says\n \n\n   \n  Aggressive dispersal tactics and angry clashes between agents and demonstrators do not occur in isolation, Ellis said, and the judge called Tuesday’s hearing in part to ensure residents can live safely while immigration enforcement takes place.\n \n\n   \n  “Folks on the sidewalks, on the streets, if they’re in a public place that they’re lawfully allowed to be, can be there unless we’ve got exigent circumstances,” the judge said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis seemed to reference a  reported  tear-gassing incident in the Old Irving Park neighborhood Saturday as a children’s Halloween parade was getting underway, saying the event “shattered their sense of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  “Kids dressed in Halloween costumes walking to a parade do not pose an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer or others. They just don’t,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  She said she hoped children in Little Village, the neighborhood where Bovino is accused of gassing protesters, “can feel safe walking to the store or walking to school and not worry about being tear-gassed and not be terrified where they live.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s not how any of us want to live,” the judge added.\n \n\n   \n  She said her order and Tuesday’s hearing was intended to ensure Bovino and his agents enforce the law in a way that is “objectionably reasonable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95725","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:18:00-04:00","title":"Trump Suggests U.S. Will Resume Nuclear Weapons Testing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that the United States would resume nuclear explosive testing on an 'equal basis' with Russia and China, marking a significant policy shift after a 33-year hiatus.

   Trump suggests the U.S. will resume testing nuclear weapons \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:18 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         BUSAN, South Korea — President Donald Trump appeared to suggest the U.S. will resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time in three decades, saying it would be on an \"equal basis\" with Russia and China. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There was no indication the U.S. would start detonating warheads, but the president offered few details about what seemed to be a significant shift in U.S. policy. He made the announcement on social media minutes before he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. When he spoke to reporters later aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington, he offered little clarity. The U.S. military already regularly tests its missiles that are capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, but it has not detonated the weapons since 1992 because of a test ban. But the president suggested that changes were necessary because other countries were testing weapons. It was unclear what he was referring to, but it evoked Cold War-era escalations. \"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" he said in a post on Truth Social. \"That process will begin immediately.\" The White House did not immediately respond to questions seeking more details. Trump ignored a question from a reporter about his post as he sat face-to-face with Xi in Busan, a meeting that focused on trade issues between the two countries. When he spoke to reporters later, Trump appeared to be conflating the testing of missiles that deliver a nuclear warhead with the testing of the warheads. Other countries, he said, \"seem to all be nuclear testing\" but when it comes to the U.S., \"We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing.\" \"I see them testing and I say, well, if they're going to test, I guess we have to test,\" Trump said as he continued speaking to reporters. Trump was asked where the tests would occur and he said, \"It'll be announced. We have test sites.\" Pentagon officials didn't immediately respond to questions about the announcement from Trump on the nuclear missile tests. Russian President Vladimir Putin this week announced that Russia tested a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone and a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Putin did not announce any tests of Russia's nuclear weapons, however, which last occurred in 1990. Trump did not specifically mention the Russian tests in his post, but alluded to the nuclear stockpiles controlled by both Xi and Putin, saying, \"Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.\" Putin in 2023 signed a bill revoking Russia's ratification of a global nuclear test ban, which Moscow said was needed to put Russia on par with the U.S. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was adopted in 1996 and bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, was signed by President Bill Clinton but never ratified by the Senate. Russia in 2023 said it would only resume tests of its nuclear weapons if Washington did it first. Earlier this year, Trump signaled he wanted to push his Russian and Chinese counterparts in the other direction, saying he wanted to resume nuclear arms control talks with both countries. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson called on the U.S. to refrain from carrying out nuclear tests. \"China hopes the U.S. will earnestly fulfill its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and honor its commitment to suspend nuclear testing,\" Guo Jiakun said at a briefing in Beijing. Despite his announcement that sounded like an escalation, Trump told reporters that he would like to see a \"denuclearization and \"de-scalation.\" \"We are actually talking to Russia about that,\" Trump said, though he did not elaborate. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, quickly criticized the president's announcement and said Trump was \"misinformed and out of touch.\" Kimball, in social media posts, said the U.S. has no reason to resume nuclear explosive testing and it would take at least 36 months to resume testing at the former test site in Nevada, where the last detonations occurred underground. \"By foolishly announcing his intention (to) resume nuclear testing, Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all U.S. allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by U.S. adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,\" Kimball said in a post on X. Japanese survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end World War II condemned Trump's announcement. \"The act vehemently opposes all countries that are endeavoring to achieve a nuclear-free and peaceful world and absolutely cannot be tolerated,\" said Jiro Hamasumi, secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo, a survivors organization that won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/media/cnn-all-access-questions-answers-explainer-faq","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"19:01:00Z","title":"CNN has a new way to watch — here’s what you need to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CNN has launched a new digital subscription service called All Access, allowing users to stream live newscasts, access a vast archive of content, and watch exclusive original programming such as 'The Enten Scale' and 'Devoted'.

EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  You may have noticed some changes around here. CNN’s family of websites and apps now features All Access, a new way to subscribe and stream CNN, complete with new types of news content for those subscribers.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a big pivot for CNN in an era of direct-to-consumer relationships and mobile-first news reports, as I wrote  here .\n \n\n   \n  It’s definitely a lot to take in. And you probably have some questions. So I wanted to help! I write the  Reliable Sources newsletter  for CNN, so I asked readers what they wanted to know about All Access, and interviewed the network’s top executives to get answers.\n \n\n   \n  ——\n \n\n   \n   Rhoda asked: “What is it? How does it work?” \n \n\n   \n  All Access is a new way to stream CNN’s news coverage. It is built into CNN’s websites and apps. When you sign up, you can stream live newscasts and access a wide array of videos and other news coverage. “We’re making CNN available on all of our platforms,” said Alex MacCallum, CNN’s executive vice president for digital products and services.\n \n\n   \n   Carole asked: “What is the cost?” \n \n\n   \n  All Access costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. CNN is enticing users to pay annually by offering an intro price of $41.99 for the first year. News outlets of all sizes are moving toward digital subscription models to make their newsrooms sustainable.\n \n\n   \n   Keith asked: “Who’s the All Access product actually for?” \n \n\n   \n  MacCallum said market research has identified several audience segments, including cord-cutters who no longer have cable but still want access to CNN’s TV channels, and CNN superfans who want the fullest possible experience. The service is designed to be mobile-first. “We’re meeting our audiences where they are now,” CNN CEO Mark Thompson said.\n \n\n   \n   Marcus asked: “I already subscribed to CNN.com last year. What happens to that?” \n \n\n   \n  Last year’s $3.99-per-month digital paywall, which gives unlimited access to CNN articles, is now called the Basic tier, while All Access adds live streams and CNN’s library of shows, plus everything in Basic.\n \n\n   \n   Janet asked: “So if I have cable, will I still get the regular old CNN?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes. CNN’s long-term distribution deals with cable and satellite providers are still in effect. And CNN’s TV schedule is not changing.\n \n\n   \n   Jack asked: “My cable includes CNN. Can that leverage to an online subscription? Or do I have to pony up again?” \n \n\n   \n  You can log in, or “authenticate,” with your cable username and password to stream All Access wherever you want. You’ll only have to pony up if you want unlimited access to CNN articles, i.e., the Basic tier.\n \n\n   \n   Jim asked: “Will CNN All Access be available on TV streaming, like Roku or Amazon Fire?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes. You can download CNN’s app through Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Android TV, Apple TV, LG TV and Samsung TV. (The All Access content is currently unavailable on Samsung TVs.)\n \n\n   \n   Marcy asked: “Will there be a complete list of what is included and what is not?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes,  here  is a handy graphic of the CNN stream schedule. In general, all of the CNN US newscasts air from morning until night, with a handful of hours replaced by shows from CNN International and CNN Headlines, and with primetime replaying overnight.\n \n\n   \n   Allan asked: “Will there be any new interactive features to integrate audience participation into your products?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes. For example, Anderson Cooper will host “All There Is Live,” a weekly companion stream to his popular “All There Is” podcast, where he’ll react to viewers’ real-time comments during the live show.\n \n\n   \n   Jerome: “Will there be any content exclusive to All Access that you won’t be able to access if you use an existing cable login? Will there be any new digital exclusive shows?” \n \n\n   \n  There are brand new shows, yes, like “ The Enten Scale ” with Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten and “ Devoted ” from Senior Correspondent Donie O’Sullivan. I authenticated with my cable username and password, and I was able to access all the new content.\n \n\n   \n   Jon asked: “Will CNN original programming like Tony Shalhoub’s show be available?” \n \n\n   \n  Yes, on a next-day basis, meaning CNN Original Series and CNN Films will be added to the streaming library the day after their TV premieres. More than a thousand hours from the network’s library are also included in All Access.\n \n\n   \n   Harry: “Will there be any changes to content on CNN Max — currently available to HBO Max subscribers?” \n \n\n   \n  The CNN live stream will leave HBO Max in the US on November 17 as CNN prioritizes the All Access service. A library of CNN Original Series and CNN Films will still be available on HBO Max after that date.\n \n\n   \n   Geneviève asked: “Any idea on when it will be available in Canada?” \n \n\n   \n  Not yet. All Access is available in the US, and company executives say they intend to expand to other parts of the world over time.\n \n\n   \n  ——\n \n\n   \n  If you have a question that isn’t covered here,  check the CNN Help Center .

tariffs \n         By Deepa Shivaram \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:50 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         GYEONGJU, South Korea– President Trump said he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping \"agreed to almost everything\" in their nearly two-hour meeting in South Korea, which Trump said was \"friendly.\" It was Trump's last event after a week of summits, trade talks and other diplomatic events in the Indo-Pacific. On the flight back to Washington, Trump told reporters traveling with him that he would rate the meeting with Xi \"a 12 out of 10.\" \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made. A lot of decisions were made too, there wasn't too much left out there,\" Trump said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The decisions that were made included lowering tariffs on Chinese exports from 57% to 47% – which Trump said was because of Xi's commitment to decrease the flow of fentanyl. \"I believe he's going to work very hard to stop the death that's coming in,\" Trump said. China will also begin repurchasing soybeans from the U.S. The pause thus far has been detrimental to farmers. Trump said China's decision from earlier this month to limit exports of rare earth minerals, which he called a \"roadblock,\" is now off the table for one year. As part of that agreement, the U.S. will also scale back some of its own export restrictions. The White House has not yet released a full readout of the meeting or details on updates to the deal. Trump said he would visit China next April for another meeting with Xi, and Xi will visit the U.S. after that. In response to the meeting, Beijing released its own statement, where Xi said China and the U.S. should not get \"caught in a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.\" The meeting took place in Busan before Trump left the region Trump and Xi met at a South Korean military base in Busan right by the city's airport. The meeting began with a handshake before moving into a session with representatives from both countries. \"President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,\" Trump said at the top of the meeting, calling Xi a friend. It's the first time Trump and Xi are meeting in person in six years. Xi noted in his remarks, through an interpreter, that the two have spoken on the phone three times and exchanged several letters since Trump was reelected last year. Xi said to Trump it was \"normal\" that the U.S. and China have \"frictions\" in their relations from time to time but said amid challenges, \"You and I at the helm of China-U.S. relations should stay the right course.\" \"China and the U.S. should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,\" Xi said. Xi also said he appreciated Trump for his contributions to the ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, and said Trump cares \"a lot about world peace.\" He also mentioned Trump's recent trip to Malaysia for the ASEAN summit, where Trump presided over a signing of a peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand. Trump has been adamant that China played no role in procuring the ceasefire, but Xi said that \"China's been helping our own way\" to end the border dispute there. Not every topic was covered in the meeting The two leaders discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, Trump said. China has been buying Russian oil but Trump said they didn't discuss that topic in depth. Taiwan – an issue Trump has shied away from in recent days – also didn't come up, he said. China considers self-governing Taiwan a breakaway province and there have been signs from Trump that he might be willing to ease up support for the island. A deal on TikTok was also potentially a topic of discussion but Trump didn't mention it in his remarks to reporters after the meeting. While flying on Air Force One back to Washington, Trump posted to his platform Truth Social that China also agreed to purchase American energy, and teased that the purchase would involve oil and gas from Alaska, though he didn't provide any further detail. \"Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out,\" Trump said, referring to the secretary of energy and interior, respectively. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589127","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"What to watch for during Casey Means' confirmation hearing for surgeon general","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and author who did not complete her surgical residency and lacks an active medical license, is being nominated for the role of U.S. Surgeon General.

See  Trump's Terms  podcast  or  sign up for our Politics newsletter  to stay up to date. Who:  Dr. Casey Means Nominated for:  Surgeon General You might know her from:  Casey Means is a wellness influencer, entrepreneur, and author. Last year, she published a bestselling book about diet and metabolic health  Good Energy . She coauthored the book with her older brother, Calley Means, who works for the Trump administration as a special government employee and is a close advisor to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She did not complete her surgical residency and does not have an active medical license, which would be a major departure from past surgeon generals. She runs a company that promotes the use of continuous glucose monitors. She has described America as in \"spiritual crisis,\" questioned the childhood vaccine schedule and the use of birth control and  has called out  what she calls \"corruption\" at the FDA. What does this role do?  Known as the nation's top doctor, the surgeon general leads the more than 6,000 members of the U.S. Public Health Service, which include physicians, nurses, and scientists working at various federal agencies. The surgeon general serves in the Department of Health and Human Services and issues public advisories and reports to convey health information to the public. What's expected at the hearing It's been more than five months since Trump announced Casey Means would replace his initial choice, Fox News contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. She will be joining the senate hearing remotely, which is unusual. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, which is holding the hearing, did not explain why she would be joining virtually. Her brother, Calley Means, shared in May that she was pregnant. Senators will likely have tough questions for her about her qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. In  financial filings  released ahead of the hearing, Means committed to resigning from her continuous glucose monitor company if confirmed. She also disclosed financial ties to the supplement industry from which she promised to divest. Means is 38 years old and a graduate of Stanford Medical School. She completed most of her residency training to be a head and neck surgeon, but quit before finishing. In the years since, she pivoted to what's known as  functional medicine , a field that focuses on root causes of illness and often encompasses lifestyle change and alternative medicine approaches that are not always evidence-based. She briefly had a functional medical practice in Oregon. But she did not become board certified and her Oregon medical license is currently  listed as inactive . Means grew her public profile on social media and through her book  Good Energy . She did the rounds on big podcasts in the wellness space with her brother and coauthor Calley Means. Her message tends to echo Kennedy's and that of his allies in the Make American Healthy Again movement, especially in flagging the high rates of chronic illnesses in the U.S. \"What we are dealing with here is so much more than a physical health crisis — this is a spiritual crisis,\" she said at a  congressional roundtable  led by Republicans last year. She often talks about the U.S. food supply and environmental toxins and she criticizes the pharmaceutical industry. Kennedy has said she will be the greatest surgeon general ever. Pushback on several fronts There has been significant opposition against Means's confirmation from medical and public health experts. They point to her lack of leadership or clinical experience, something that surgeon generals traditionally have, and  some of her views . For example, she has raised concerns about the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule and  questioned  hormonal birth control. She has also endorsed raw milk, as has Kennedy, who would be her boss. \"The Senate's likely confirmation of Casey Means as Surgeon General, an individual who never completed medical training, would mark a disastrous precedent for the nation's top public health role,\" Dr. Jerome Adams wrote in a statement to NPR. Adams served as surgeon general in the first Trump administration. \"Numerous qualified candidates — fully trained, licensed physicians who champion prevention and wellness —could lead the 6,000-person [U.S. Public Health Service] with distinction,\" he added. \"Confirming Means reflects a capitulation to political pressures, not a desire to get the best person for the job.\" Earlier this year, opposition to her nomination  also emerged  from some of Kennedy's MAHA supporters, partly out of concern that she wouldn't be critical enough of vaccines or carry forward other priorities of their movement. Still, it seems unlikely that the Senate would have scheduled the hearing if the Trump White House weren't confident that Means could be confirmed. The withdrawal of previous health official nominations from this administration have all happened before a hearing took place. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590293","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Keeps Flirting with the Idea of a Third Term.

That would be unconstitutional \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Flying on Air Force One somewhere between Japan and South Korea, President Trump appeared to finally acknowledge a third term isn't in the cards. \"I have my highest poll numbers that I've ever had,\" Trump said wistfully. \"And you know, based on what I read, I guess I'm not allowed to run. So we'll see what happens.\" Trump's job approval rating,  as tracked by Gallup , is not in fact at a high point — though at 41% he isn't at his lowest point, either. Saying \"we'll see what happens,\" is a standard Trump line that leaves his options open. Though, in this case, legal experts say there is no way around the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. It states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There are many parts of the constitution that are unclear,\" said Rick Hassen, who specializes in election law at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"But the 22nd Amendment is quite clear: no more than two terms. And it was passed because there was a president who served more than two terms and the country thought that that was not good.\" But that hasn't stopped Steve Bannon, an on-again off-again Trump ally and MAGA mastermind, from talking about a third Trump term as a certainty. How Bannon stirred the pot \"Well, he's going to get a third term,\" Bannon said in  a recent interview with The Economist . \"Trump is going to be president in '28 and people just ought to get accommodated with that.\" Asked about the Constitution, Bannon said, \"There's many different alternatives.\" In an April interview  with  Morning Edition  host Steve Inskeep , Bannon gave slightly more detail. \"We're working on some things that are well inside the Constitution … and I think people will agree there will be very smart work arounds,\" Bannon said, before adding that talk of a third Trump term is \"exploding liberals heads, exploding progressive's heads that Trump's going to be with them forever.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It would be easy to chalk this up as wishful thinking or even just trolling from a professional provocateur trying to ingratiate himself to Trump. But the president himself has kept it going, too. Monday on Air Force One, when asked about Bannon's assertions about a third term, Trump said he would \"love to do it\" and again said it is \"very terrible\" to have such good numbers. Asked if that meant he was \"not ruling it out,\" Trump said, \"You have to tell me.\" Though he also suggested that Republicans have a strong bench of potential 2028 candidates and said a ticket featuring Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be unbeatable. He did bat down one of the possible loopholes floating around — that he could run for vice president and then return to office after the elected president steps aside. \"I think the people wouldn't like that,\" Trump said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" But, just like Bannon, Trump leaves the option of somehow staying in office dangling out there. What Congress has to say about that Just outside the Oval Office, red campaign-style \"Trump 2028\" hats sit on a bookcase of merchandise the president shows off to visitors. \n       \n       Twitter \n       Last month, when Democratic leaders visited the White House to talk about averting a government shutdown,  the hats appeared on the resolute desk mid-meeting .  \"It was the strangest thing ever,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN afterward. \"I just looked at the hat, looked at JD Vance, who was seated to my left and said, 'Don't you got a problem with this?' And he said 'no comment' and that was the end of it.\" That is, until the White House tweeted out photos of the meeting with the hats looming large. As Trump talked repeatedly about a third term this week, members of Congress were asked to weigh in, too. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he didn't see a path to a third Trump term because amending the Constitution takes a long time. \"I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about the constrictions of the Constitution,\" said Johnson. \"As much as so many of the American people lament that. The Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that's ever been produced, and he has a good time with that, trolling the Democrats whose hair is on fire at that very prospect.\" In an  interview with NPR's  Here and Now  on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also said Trump was simply trolling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Brendan Nyhan, a government professor at Dartmouth College, says it doesn't really matter if at this moment the president is serious or not. \"We are probably going to hear about it for the next three years, because he enjoys it,\" said Nyhan. \"It gets the kind of reaction he wants and it serves his political purpose.\" Trump is both making liberal's heads explode — as Bannon put it — and trying to delay becoming a lame duck president, whose power wanes as the campaign to replace him heats up. Nyhan said the fact that anyone is talking about it is a symptom of what he calls an \"authoritarian malaise\" in the country. \"It's profoundly destabilizing to call into question something as blatant as the 22nd Amendment, which explicitly rules out what Trump is 'joking' about,\" said Nyhan, who leads Bright Line Watch, which monitors the status of American democracy. \"We've seen again and again him joking about things that he means to encourage or at least seems to give tacit approval to.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In his second term, Trump has massively expanded his executive power, as Republicans in Congress largely either cheer or shrug. \"Is it possible that he could try to suspend elections, suspend the Constitution, run for a third term,\" said Rick Hassen, who leads UCLA's Safeguarding Democracy Project. \"All of these things are possible, but that means we are no longer the American democracy that we've had, and then the country's in real trouble. But if you're asking about a legal path to a third term, it's just not there.\" Plus, he asked slyly, would Trump really want to run for a third term against former President Barack Obama? ( Trump says he would .) NPR's  Saige Miller  contributed to this report. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   President Trump keeps flirting with the idea of serving a third term in office. Here he is last night on Air Force One. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Based on what I read, I guess I'm not allowed to run. So we'll see what happens. MARTIN: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution clearly states, no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice. So why is Trump talking about it again? NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith digs in. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: This week's outbreak of Trump 2028 mania began when Trump ally and MAGA mastermind Steve Bannon sat down for an interview with The Economist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE BANNON: Well, he's going to get a third term. So Trump '28. Trump is going to be president in '28, and people just ought to get accommodated with that. KEITH: Asked about the 22nd Amendment, he said there are many different alternatives, but he didn't detail them. Bannon said nearly the same thing back in April in an interview with MORNING EDITION host Steve Inskeep. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) BANNON: We're working on some things that are well withinside the Constitution, and it'll be very - I think people will agree that'll be... STEVE INSKEEP: Give me an example. BANNON: ...Very smart workarounds. INSKEEP: Give me an example of one thing. BANNON: I don't want to whet your appetite. Let's get through... INSKEEP: (Laughter). BANNON: ...Let's get through the hundred days. INSKEEP: You've already whetted my appetite. BANNON: Let's get through - no, because it's exploding liberals' heads, progressive heads that Trump's going to be with them forever. KEITH: Now, it would be easy to chalk this up as Bannon stirring the pot, but President Trump himself has kept it going. Here he was on Air Force One, Monday morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever. It's very terrible. I have my best numbers. If you read it... UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: You're not ruling out a third term? TRUMP: ...If you read it - am I not ruling it out? You'll have to tell me. All I can tell you is... KEITH: He did bat down the idea of running for vice president and then assuming the presidency. But just like Bannon, Trump leaves the possibility of a third term dangling out there. Here he was back in March, again, on Air Force One. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I'm just telling you, I've had more people say, please run again. I said, we have a long way to go before we even think about that. KEITH: I followed up, asking, are you planning to leave office on January 20, 2029, or are you saying you might not? He looked directly at me and then looked over my head. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Go ahead. Any other questions? KEITH: The president stocks red Trump 2028 hats on a bookcase of merch just outside the Oval Office. Last month, when Democratic leaders visited to talk about averting the government shutdown, the hats showed up on the president's desk, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HAKEEM JEFFRIES: It was the strangest thing ever. And I just looked at the hat, looked at JD Vance, who was seated to my left, and said, don't you got a problem with this? And he said, no comment. KEITH: Yesterday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he didn't see a path to a third Trump term. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE JOHNSON: I think the president knows - and he and I have talked about the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that - the Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that's ever been produced, and he has a good time with that. KEITH: So is it all just a troll? Brendan Nyhan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College. BRENDAN NYHAN: We're probably going to hear about this for the next three years because he enjoys it. It gets the kind of reaction he wants, and it serves his political purpose. KEITH: Trump is both making liberals' heads explode, as Bannon put it, and trying to delay becoming a lame duck president - less relevant than those competing to replace him. Again, Nyhan. NYHAN: It's profoundly destabilizing to call into question something as blatant as the 22nd Amendment, which explicitly rules out what Trump is, quote, \"joking\" about. And we've seen again and again him joking about things that he means to encourage or at least, you know, seem to give tacit approval to. KEITH: In his second term, Trump has massively expanded his executive power as Republicans in Congress either cheer or shrug. But Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA, says, there's no nuance in the 22nd Amendment. RICK HASEN: Is it possible that he could try to suspend elections, suspend the Constitution, run for a third term? All of these things are possible, but that means we're no longer the American democracy that we've had, and then the country's in real trouble. But if you're asking about a legal path to a third term, it's just not there. KEITH: Plus, he asks, would President Trump really want to run against former President Barack Obama?

The Nigerian author, 91, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, becoming the first African to do so. Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Soyinka said he believed it had little to do with him and was instead a product of the United States' immigration policies. He said he was told to reapply if he wished to enter again. \"It's not about me, I'm not really interested in going back to the United States,\" he said. \"But a principle is involved. Human beings deserve to be treated decently wherever they are.\" Soyinka, who has taught in the U.S. and previously held a green card, joked on Tuesday that his green card \"had an accident\" eight years ago and \"fell between a pair of scissors.\" In 2017, he destroyed his green card in protest over Trump's first inauguration. The letter he received informing him of his visa revocation cites \"additional information became available after the visa was issued,\" as the reason for its revocation, but does not describe what that information was. Soyinka believes it may be because he recently referred to Trump as a \"white version of Idi Amin,\" a reference to the dictator who ruled Uganda from 1971 until 1979. He jokingly referred to his rejection as a \"love letter\" and said that while he did not blame the officials, he would not be applying for another visa. \"I have no visa. I am banned, obviously, from the United States, and if you want to see me, you know where to find me.\" The U.S. Consulate in Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, directed all questions to the State Department in Washington, D.C. Through a spokesperson, it said that because under US law visa records are generally confidential, they would not discuss the specifics of this case while stressing that \"visas are a privilege, not a right\" and that \"visas may be revoked at any time, at the discretion of the U.S. government, whenever circumstances warrant.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/biden-autopen-investigation-house-oversight-final-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"06:26:00-04:00","title":"GOP-led Oversight Committee says Biden pardons signed by autopen are ‘void’ in final report","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has released a 93-page report asserting that all executive actions signed by former President Joe Biden using the autopen are legally void due to concerns about his cognitive decline and a lack of documented, personally authorized decision-making.

6:26 PM EDT, Tue October 28, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former President Joe Biden experienced such “cognitive decline” while in office that it remains a serious question as to whether he was aware of the substance of the various pardons and commutations signed in his name  via autopen , the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee asserted in a letter it sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging her to consider whether that clemency might be invalid and to take action for potential prosecution against some of Biden’s aides.\n \n\n   \n  The committee “deems void President Biden’s executive actions that were signed using the Autopen, and the committee determines that action by the Department of Justice is warranted to address the legal consequences of that determination,” it wrote to Bondi in the letter released Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The letter was made public alongside a 93-page report outlining the committee’s conclusions from its months-long investigation into Biden’s use of the autopen. It alleged the committee had found “a cover-up of the president’s cognitive decline” and “no record demonstrating President Biden himself made all of the executive decisions that were attributed to him.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden has publicly disputed that, saying he made all decisions as president and calling Republicans who have suggested otherwise “liars.”\n \n\n   \n  To support its assertions, the committee report includes excerpts of interviews with 14 former senior Biden aides, and it released transcripts and video later Tuesday morning. Although the committee raised serious questions about the Biden administration’s process for awarding pardons, it did not cite any direct evidence that anyone other than Biden made the decisions that his staff later put into effect. Instead, the committee pointed to a lack of clear records indicating that Biden was the decision-maker. The panel did not subpoena Biden to testify in the probe.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia, the ranking member on the House Oversight committee, called the report a “sham investigation” in a statement, adding that “every White House official testified President Biden fully executed his duties as President of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  “The testimonies also make it clear the former President authorized every executive order, pardon, and use of the autopen,” Garcia said while calling on House Republicans to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  In their interviews, Biden aides defended the process they had in place for using the autopen and stated firmly that Biden made his own decisions.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have long raised questions about Biden’s mental state, but in releasing the report, the GOP-led committee seemed to suggest a path for continued impacts of its work.\n \n\n   \n  The letter specifically asked that the Justice Department further investigate three top Biden White House aides who  invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify  to the committee: former White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor, and Biden aides Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini.\n \n\n   \n  Invoking the Fifth Amendment is typically done to avoid answering specific questions. Though it can be perceived by the public as a way of avoiding accountability, the US Supreme Court has long regarded the right against self-incrimination as a venerable part of the Constitution and, in legal proceedings, tried to ensure that a witness’ silence not be viewed as evidence of guilt.\n \n\n   \n  The Committee also wrote to the Board of Medicine for Washington, DC, requesting that it investigate whether O’Connor should be disciplined in any manner for “issuing misleading medical reports, misrepresenting treatments, failing to conform to standards of practice, or other acts of violation of District of Columbia law regulating licensed physicians.”\n \n\n   \n  Former Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients  told the committee  that after Biden’s disastrous debate performance last year, he recommended O’Connor conduct a full medical workup, including a cognitive exam, and O’Connor said he would take the suggestion under advisement.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to O’Connor, Bernal, Tomasini, Zients, and former staffer Bruce Reed. A Biden spokesperson said, “This investigation into baseless claims has confirmed what has been clear from the start: President Biden made the decisions of his presidency.”\n \n\n   \n  “There was no conspiracy, no cover-up, and no wrongdoing. Congressional Republicans should stop focusing on political retribution and instead work to end the government shutdown,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The book “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” co-authored by CNN’s Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, documented how Biden, his closest aides and his family forged ahead with the former president’s doomed 2024 reelection bid despite signs of his physical and mental decline.\n \n\n   \n  “Our report reveals how key aides colluded to mislead the public and the extraordinary measures they took to sustain the appearance of presidential authority as Biden’s capacity to function independently diminished. Executive actions performed by Biden White House staff and signed by autopen are null and void,” said Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, the committee’s chairman, said in a statement that called for accountability.\n \n\n   \n  The committee’s assertion that Bondi seek to act on their declaration of Biden’s actions as “void” suggested they were exploring legal ways to undo his grants of clemency. Such a move would likely face significant legal challenges; there is no mechanism or precedent to reverse a pardon issued by a past president, legal experts say. In 2005, during the second Bush administration, the Justice Department looked at the legality of a president’s use of the autopen and endorsed it – so long as the decision came from the president.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump administration officials appeared to be contemplating a world in which the pardons would be invalidated. In a  Monday email CNN obtained from a source , the Trump-installed Pardon Attorney at the Justice Department,  Ed Martin , told Comer that his “ongoing investigation” of the way that pardons and commutations were issued during Biden’s presidency had revealed “abuses” of the process by “political actors.” He wrote that his office would not defend any of the acts of clemency “without further investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “My office cannot support the validity of AutoPen pardons for individuals such as Anthony Fauci, Adam Schiff, Mark Milley, and many more without further examination and fact-finding,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X, Bondi said her team was “reviewing the Biden administration’s reported use of autopen for pardons,” and that she looked forward to working alongside the Oversight Committee “to deliver accountability for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Even before the committee’s action, the Justice Department and the White House had been looking into Biden’s use of the autopen, which had long been a fixation of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  reported in May  that Martin, who also heads the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group to look into whether alleged efforts by the previous administrations to improperly use the levers of government, had been examining Biden’s past pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In June,  Trump issued an executive order  instructing Bondi and the White House counsel to conduct “an investigation into who ran the United States while President Biden was in office,” as well as Biden’s use of an autopen for important orders. That probe was to include “who authorized its use, and the validity of the resulting Presidential policy decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  The Biden camp responded to the executive order with a written statement calling Trump’s assertions “ridiculous and false.” “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n   Biden then spoke to New York Times reporters  on the phone, telling the newspaper in a 10-minute interview that he “made every decision” and pardoned people proactively so they would not face costly Justice Department investigations when Trump took over.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody knows how vindictive he is, so we knew that they’d do what they’re doing now,” Biden told The Times at the time, adding, “I consciously made all those decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  As president, Biden issued pardons and commutations to 4,245 people – more acts of clemency than any other president. Perhaps most controversially, he preemptively pardoned prominent Trump critics and members of his own family, including his son who was convicted of federal tax-related charges, fearing they might be targeted for retribution when Trump took office for a second time.\n \n\n   \n  “These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,” Biden wrote at the time in a statement about the initial batch of pardons, issued hours before he was set to welcome Trump to the White House for tea before attending his swearing-in. “Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety and financial security of targeted individuals and their families.”\n \n\n   \n    A focus on Biden’s pardon process\n \n\n   \n  The final section of the report sought to outline issues with Biden’s use of the autopen.\n \n\n   \n  While former staffers like Reed said the Biden administration’s practice for pardons was like “the prior two administrations” for whom he served, the House Oversight Committee raised questions about how the pardons were implemented.\n \n\n   \n  The committee focused specifically on the lack of documentation around a key in-person meeting where the pardons for Biden’s family, Dr. Anthony Fauci, General Mark Milley and members of the January 6 Committee were allegedly finalized.\n \n\n   \n  The pardons were conveyed by a “game of telephone,” the committee said. The report noted Biden’s decision was conveyed by Reed and White House Counsel Ed Siskel to Rosa Po, an aide to White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. From there, Po called Zients, Zients authorized Po to send an email authorizing the use of autopen to sign the pardons, and Po sent the email to the staff secretary’s office, who then told someone to use the autopen for pardons.\n \n\n   \n  “In light of the former president’s cognitive deterioration and the cover-up from his inner circle, this ‘approval’ process calls into question the validity of all pardons reportedly granted by President Biden throughout his tenure,” the committee stated, deeming “void” every executive action signed by the Joe Biden autopen “without proper, corresponding, contemporaneous, written approval traceable to the president’s own consent.”\n \n\n   \n  The panel’s final report highlighted former Biden White House staffers’ testimony in which they expressed degrees of confusion about the decision-making process.\n \n\n   \n  Former White House Staff Secretary Neera Tanden, who was responsible for managing paper flow to the president, told committee investigators that she didn’t know what happened to the decision book between when she gave the materials to the Oval Office operations team and received it back with Biden’s signature, the report alleges. Zients said in another excerpt that he did not know who actually operated the autopen and shared that Hunter Biden did take part in some of the pardon discussions. And former White House chief of staff Ron Klain testified during one portion of his interview that Biden made some executive decisions “orally,” but the excerpt didn’t address whether that pertained to pardon decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “The Biden White House’s executive decision-making procedures were so lax that the chain of custody for a given decision is difficult or impossible to establish,” the panel wrote. “Documents that were used to predicate executive actions  should  be sufficiently traceable to ensure they reflect the will of the president. Instead, the Biden White House’s flimsy procedure appears to have been extremely vulnerable to abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  The aides, though, insisted to House Oversight investigators that Biden was making the calls. Tanden said there were never any executive orders auto-penned based solely on a senior advisor’s request. She said she never authorized the use of the autopen without a signature card from the former president.\n \n\n   \n  “I sometimes have a reputation for toughness, and I always require the signature card,” Tanden said, according to a transcript.\n \n\n   \n  Klain said, “We used the same process that I thought prior presidents had used.”\n \n\n   \n  And Zients emphasized that the picture that Republicans were trying to paint about the pardon process was not accurate.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want you to miss the rigor and the amount of iterations, the amount of time the president spent on pardons. He made these decisions, obviously, but he also made these decisions after, in most cases, many, many meetings,” Zients said.\n \n\n   \n   According to Pew Research,  96% of Biden’s acts of clemency were in the last three months and 20 days of his presidency. The then-president declared the commutations were going to “non violent” drug offenders, but according to Justice Department emails obtained by the committee, Justice Department ethics attorney Bradley Weinsheimer wrote to Biden White House staff: “I think you should stop saying that because it is untrue or at least misleading.”\n \n\n   \n  With little time to vet the list of those to receive commutation, Weinsheimer wrote that he and his team identified “19 that were highly problematic,” 16 of whom Biden granted clemency, including “violent offenders, including those who committed acts of violence during the offense of conviction, or who otherwise have a history of violence…” For example, Marvin Gabrion, whose death sentence Biden commuted in favor of a term of life in prison, was convicted of kidnapping and murdering 19-year-old Rachel Timmerman and her 11-month-old daughter two days before he was scheduled to be tried on rape charges.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea if the president was aware of these backgrounds when making clemency decisions,” Weinsheimer wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In his email to Comer suggesting he would not defend previous Biden pardons, Martin noted Weinsheimer’s message.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590103","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"18:36:00-20:00","title":"Unpacking The U.S. Economy’s ‘Cockroach’ Problem","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the emerging financial risk posed by the rapid growth of the private credit market, which has expanded to a $2 trillion value and operates largely outside the reach of the Dodd-Frank Act.

LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   In September 2008, chaos broke out on Wall Street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The Dow tumbled more than 500 points after two pillars... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) FARAI CHIDEYA, BYLINE: The investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy this morning after failing to find a buyer... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Financial markets from Asia to Europe are doing their utmost to prevent Monday from turning from dark to black. KELLY: Banks went belly up. The stock market crashed, and global financial systems lurched to the brink of collapse. The U.S. government stepped in, bailed out the banks, averted a full-on depression, and two years later, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act - sweeping legislation aimed at protecting American taxpayers and at preventing a repeat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: For years our financial sector was governed by antiquated and poorly enforced rules that allowed some to game the system and take risks that endangered the entire economy. KELLY: That's then-President Barack Obama signing the legislation in 2010. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: Unscrupulous lenders locked consumers into complex loans with hidden costs. Firms like AIG placed massive risky bets with borrowed money. And while the rules left abuse and excess unchecked, they also left taxpayers on the hook if a big bank or financial institution ever failed. KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - the Dodd-Frank Act increased oversight of financial institutions, but private credit firms are mostly exempt from these regulations, and one economist at Yale argues the risky loans they offer could lead to another crash. Coming up, she'll explain why. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Mary Louise Kelly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. When companies need a loan, traditionally they would turn to a bank. But increasingly, they are turning to financial firms that are not really banks but have a lot of cash. This is called the private credit market. It has exploded in the past 15 years. It's now valued at around $2 trillion. But what happens if those loans aren't backed up? Natasha Sarin is president of the Yale Budget Lab. Natasha Sarin, welcome. NATASHA SARIN: Thanks so much for having me. KELLY: So you wrote a piece. This was for The New York Times, and the headline - which I loved - was \"How Bad Is Finance's Cockroach Problem? We Are About To Find Out.\" Unpack that for us. Who were the cockroaches in this scenario? SARIN: So the cockroach I can't take credit for because it comes from Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, as he was commenting on something that many of us who aren't deep in the finance industry may have even missed over the course of the last many weeks, which is that two auto-related firms went bankrupt over the course of a few weeks in September. That in and of itself is not necessarily all that interesting. They're relatively small firms. But what is kind of interesting and pretty important is that there are a lot of allegations of fraud associated with those two particular bankruptcies and a lot of concerns that after these firms failed, it turns out that they had borrowed much more money in ways that were ultimately pretty opaque and kind of hidden even from their own investors than people had previously realized. KELLY: So just take us step by step through this. You said these are two firms. Are they firms we've heard of? Who were they? And just tell me a tiny bit of the story. SARIN: Yeah. These are two auto-related firms. One is a company that is called Tricolor. Tricolor was a company that is one of the largest subprime auto lenders and used car retailers in Texas and California, and its business model is a lot about lending to people who either have no or very limited credit history. KELLY: OK. And what's the other one? SARIN: The other one is a company that's called First Brands, and you probably haven't heard of it, but they make all types of different car parts. KELLY: So we're not talking Ford. We're not talking GM. What is it that you see happening that has you so worried? SARIN: So one piece that's interesting is about the way they were ultimately borrowing. And it turns out that they were borrowing in part from traditional banks and public markets, but they were also borrowing in part from private markets and from these private credit firms. And importantly, when they ultimately went bankrupt, it had to do with learning more about the fact that these firms had allegedly committed fraud by doing things like offering the same collateral to multiple people who lend it to them. And that type of opacity, such that the lenders themselves didn't even realize how leveraged, how much borrowing these two particular firms had done, is a feature of what you can see happening these days in private credit markets. But because of regulation that we did in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it is happening much less in public markets and much less in banks. KELLY: OK. So we've mentioned the 2008 financial crisis a couple of times. What is it you see that feels the same as 2008? What is it you see that maybe is not parallel? Start with what's the same. SARIN: Yeah. And Andrew Bailey, who runs the central Bank of England, said anyone watching these two particular bankruptcies, like, alarm bells should be going off if they were anywhere near the 2008 financial crisis. We are starting to see the same kind of slicing and dicing of literally everything. Think car loans. Think leases on AI data centers. Think of bills that are owed from plastic surgery patients. Literally everything and turning it into allegedly relatively safe slices of financial securities. But the other piece is there, too. We're also starting to see really significant lending, and it's happening very substantially in these private credit markets. KELLY: So to things that should be different, should feel different from 2008, there were all these regulations and changes that went into effect to make sure we never had a meltdown like that. Why are these firms largely exempt from all those changes? SARIN: So in response to the financial crisis, we did a lot of regulating. And the result of that regulating was that traditional financial institution - so your bank - is doing a lot less of this risky lending than they were doing historically. Coming in to fill that void are these private credit firms, and the argument the private credit firms are making about their business model is actually they are better positioned to do this type of lending. And the reason they say that is because they're not reliant like banks are on bank depositors who can get flighty and get nervous and then ultimately flee and lead to a bank run and then a cascade of bank runs that brings down the whole financial system. KELLY: So bottom line, how worried are you about these private credit firms? SARIN: I think in some sense, it's a little bit early innings for us. The thing that I'm always nervous about is - you know, what happened in the aftermath of the financial crisis is we took important steps to bring under the regulatory umbrella a lot of lending that ultimately turned out to be riskier and more damaging than we had previously anticipated. And it's sort of concerning that you see these private credit firms themselves, as they advertise themselves, explicitly saying an advantage that they have is they're not subject to those regulations and they're not subject to those types of improved prudential standards. And so I'm pretty nervous that if you have a bunch of financial activity that's ultimately happening in the shadows, eventually, once we get a downturn and when invariably the economy worsens, you're going to be in a situation where those private credit firms - which, by the way, are reliant on money from ordinary people, just like banks because they're heavily reliant on things like premiums from insurance companies that they purchase - they're going to be in a situation where losses on the financial markets and losses by these financial credit firms are ultimately going to fall to regular people. KELLY: Let me put to you a counterargument. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, he has a very different take. He says, \"the growth of private credit shows that financial regulations after 2008 are too tight\" (ph) - direct quote. He says we need to make capital more risk-based. What's wrong with that argument? SARIN: I think the challenge with that argument is it in some sense ignores the history that we have well experienced over the course of not just the last financial crisis that we had in this country, but every financial crisis that has existed in this country and in other countries, which is ultimately when you're in a situation where you have too much leverage in a system and financial institutions that are ultimately incredibly interconnected. And that, by the way, is the case even with these private credit firms because now you're starting to see banks invest in these private credit firms. And so it's in some sense, like, despite their being not directly the originators of this new risk-lending, they're still tied in to this whole pool of potential risk. And so while I'm sympathetic to the idea that by regulating one sector of the financial market you've had risk go in to other sectors, my response to that isn't we should deregulate a sector. My response to that is we need to think about how we have a regulatory umbrella that is more all-encompassing of the types of activities that are happening all over our financial system. KELLY: How much are ordinary people at risk of being caught up in all this? 2008 was about a lot of things, but among it was ordinary people's mortgages. I know you have been thinking about 401(k)s potentially down the road being caught up in this private credit - the riskiness that you see. SARIN: Totally. And you saw over the course of just the last few months a loosening with respect to the possibility that 401(k)s can be invested in some of these alternative asset classes and in private credit in ways that they haven't been historically. And you're also seeing private credit - in some sense, when you hear the word private credit, you think private. KELLY: Right. SARIN: And so it sounds different to you than a bank or public markets. But the challenge is where is private credit ultimately getting the dollars that are coming its way to invest? And those dollars are coming from things like pension funds. Those dollars are coming from things like private equity firms buying insurance companies. And when you buy an insurance company, you owe money to ordinary people - the policyholders of that insurance company. And so a little bit what makes me nervous about this moment is I do not think ordinary people or even very sophisticated academics who consider these questions or really anyone outside of these private credit firms has a full understanding of the ways in which the market is ultimately connected to the rest of the financial system. As a result, ordinary people's dollars are on the line just like they were in 2008. KELLY: So what can we do? As we see the train coming down the tracks, what can be done now by the government, by Congress, by the administration to try to prevent it from going off the rails? SARIN: Now, one thing that gives you a little bit of optimism about this moment and a little bit of hope that we won't find ourselves in exactly the same type of crisis that we have historically is exactly this point about the matching of incentives. So private credit firms themselves are incredibly incentivized to do lots of diligence about the types of lending that's happening at their particular firm and to try and understand the nature of the interconnected indebtedness that we've been describing. And so it's not really, in my view, that the idea that these incentives are well-aligned. That's good. And in fact, you saw some private credit firms actually short exactly these two auto-related firms because they had some suspicions based on their understanding of this market, which is very deep, that maybe all was not exactly right. But I don't think you can rely on the industry to self-regulate in that way. I think you really have to have a deep conversation about the fact that we've seen really rapid growth in a really constrained timespan in the private credit market, and Congress needs to think about ways in which to better regulate these markets. And we as sort of consumers need to do our own due diligence about the ways in which our dollars are ultimately exposed to potential risks down the road. KELLY: Lay the traps for the cockroaches to bring it home. (LAUGHTER) SARIN: We'll do our best. KELLY: Natasha Sarin, thank you so much. SARIN: Thanks so much for having me.

it) \n         By Camila Domonoske \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Car insurance How has the price changed since before the pandemic? On average, premiums are up 55% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Almost all of that increase came between 2022 and 2024.) Why has the price gone up? Cars  are more expensive;  parts and repairs  are more expensive;  medical bills  following auto accidents are more expensive. Modern cars are packed with pricey electronics, pushing up the cost of fixing even minor fender-benders, while empty streets during the pandemic encouraged speeding and led to more severe (and more expensive) crashes. All those things cost insurers money. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Patty Kuderer is the insurance commissioner for the state of Washington; when insurance companies want to raise premiums, they need to ask her office for approval. \"The claims paid really drive the cost of the premiums,\" she says. And when companies bring her proof of the higher amounts they're paying out — like they have in recent years — she's required by law to approve those increases. But those price hikes may finally be about to top out. \"The good news is that, largely, the industry is caught up on premiums, and we're now starting to see companies reduce costs and compete for business,\" says Bob Passmore, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the trade group that represents insurers. Insurance companies had strong profits last year, and price hikes have stabilized. \"We may have seen the worst of it,\" he says. With one caveat: There's a six to 12 month delay between when the insurance companies get hit by higher costs and when they're passed along to consumers, as companies assess their actual costs and get approval from regulators like Kuderer. Price hikes in the near term — caused by tariffs or other factors — could push up premiums again in the future. What are people doing about it? Shopping around, for one thing: Data analytics company LexisNexis reports that drivers are shopping around for policies at the highest rate since 2020, when the company started tracking. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Another thing they're doing: suffering. In  a recent survey  by LendingTree, more than 58% of drivers said their car insurance is a financial burden; more than half said they have cut back on other expenses to be able to afford their premium; more than a third said they avoid filing claims to keep their premium low. And more than a third of respondents said that they have at some point driven  without  car insurance — which is illegal in every state except New Hampshire. The percentage of drivers on the road without insurance rose from 12.4% to 15.4% between 2018 and 2023, according to the  Insurance Research Council. 'I just couldn't afford it': Driving uninsured  Zoe, a pastry chef in Pennsylvania, understands the importance of car insurance better than most. A few years ago, she had only the bare minimum insurance on her Toyota when an accident financially devastated her. Without insurance that would replace her undriveable vehicle, she was left car-less, with an hour-long commute. Her savings were entirely wiped out. When she was able to replace her vehicle, she made sure to get full coverage insurance, at $230 a month. But it was a tight squeeze to cover it, and then her rent went up by $400. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We're only using Zoe's first name because, for a short time after that, she became one of those people driving without insurance. \"I fully didn't pay my car insurance bill for about four weeks just because I couldn't afford it,\" Zoe says. \"We have to eat every week. You have to pay the power and the water bill and the rent, and the rent keeps going higher, and milk's $4 a gallon.\" Zoe was acutely aware of the risks she was taking if she got in a crash or pulled over. \"I slow down at every single intersection, regardless of whether the light was green or not,\" she recalls with a heavy sigh. \"I'm careful at every turn. I get worried.\" She ultimately scraped together the funds to get her coverage back. But it costs extra to reinstate coverage after it lapses, one reason among many why insurance advisors strongly advise against letting that happen. \"The upfront costs of buying insurance in the first place are very, very high,\" says Rob Bhatt, an auto insurance expert with LendingTree. \"But then the cost of not having insurance potentially can be a lot higher. It's a really tough thing to balance.\" Cutting back and paring down ... Experts are increasingly recommending that drivers price out insurance costs before they purchase new vehicles. Otherwise, the sticker shock can be painful. Brandy Levene, in Yakima, Wash., replaced her older vehicle with a 2018 Acura RDX and was stunned to see her insurance bill clock in at $500 a month. She had to cut back elsewhere to pay the bill. \"Normally, especially during the summer, we've gone to stay in a hotel and go out of town, maybe go to another state for a couple of days,\" she says. That all got put on hold. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then she shopped around. By switching providers, she managed to bring that bill down to $190 a month. That's still more than $2,000 a year. She remembers when her car insurance cost less than she spent on gasoline — now, she says, insurance is more than gas and car maintenance put together. And, she says with frustration, \"I'm not benefiting anything from it because I don't ever file a claim. So it's like I'm just paying this $190, I guess, to prevent from getting a ticket?\" Shannon Martin, an insurance expert with Bankrate, says that, to make matters worse, the rising costs of repairs mean that many people are likely now  under- insured, meaning that their insurance might not pay out as much as they'd need if they were in an accident. \"There's a feeling that you're paying more and you're getting less. And that's because you honestly are,\" Martin says. In fact, while she knows it's unwelcome advice, Martin says it would probably be a good idea to pay a little extra to  increase  the limits on a plan that was set up a few years ago, to make sure that any potential future payouts can keep up with your real expenses. … and postponing teenage driving Martin has a few tips on saving on insurance. Shop around, of course. For married couples, whoever has better credit should set up the policy. And, she says, \"if you have kids in the household, that means you're going to have teen drivers at some point. We don't have to give kids driver's licenses when they turn 16. That's our choice.\" That choice recently struck home for Levene. Her 17-year-old son, Josiah, has his license, and a family member has a car they'd be willing to pass down to him. But … \"I went through the process to see what it would cost to add him, and they told me it would be $350 a month,\" Levene says. \"And I'm like, 'Oh, I can't do this … that's so much money.'\" Levene would like it if she didn't have to drive her son to school — and Josiah would certainly love to have a set of wheels. \"Just to go somewhere outside of Yakima,\" he says wistfully. \"Just not being in this cycle where I'm just stuck in this town, stuck with the same life, stuck in the same living situation.\" But until he can get a job to cover that insurance bill himself, stuck is exactly what he is. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1195337204","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-10","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"Stock Market Volatility and Sector Trends in April 2024","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The stock market has experienced notable volatility in the past week, with gains and losses across various sectors.

There is a moment of awe that washes over you when you step into a forest. Century-old trees tower above, sunlight twinkling through them. Birds tweet. Spiders weave their elaborate webs. The smell of pine needles fill the air.  The act of spending time in the forest is what the Japanese call  shinrin-yoku , a term originating in the 1980s that means \"bathing in the forest atmosphere,\" says Qing Li, a researcher on this topic and a professor at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo.  \"This is not exercise or hiking or jogging,\" he writes in his 2018 book  Forest Bathing: How Trees Can Help You Find Health and Happiness . \"It is simply being in nature, connecting with it through our sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch.\"   Not only is \"forest bathing\" a magical way to explore nature, decades of research has shown that it's good for your health. It can  boost your immune system ,  lower blood pressure  and  help with depression . It can also reduce the stress hormones  cortisol and adrenaline  and turn down the dial on your body's  fight-or-flight response . Li and Gary Evans, director of the  Forest Bathing Institute in the U.K. , talk to Life Kit about the science behind forest bathing and how you can reap these health benefits. 1. Find a location where you're surrounded by trees  The ideal place to forest bathe is well, in a forest. But if you live far away from one or don't have the means to get there, any place that has a lot of trees and quiet spaces will do.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Forest Bathing: A Retreat To Nature Can Boost Immunity And Mood \n       \"You can also get beneficial effects from a city park,\" says Li, but they won't be as significant as walking in the deep woods. A 2022 study published in the  International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health  found that walking in a forest park had a  greater impact on cardiovascular function  than doing so in an urban park.  Walking in an urban park still has health benefits. Another study published in 2022 found that it can  significantly improve mood and reduce stress , compared to walking in an urban gray setting.  2. Set aside a good chunk of time  To reap the ultimate rewards of  shinrin-yoku , plan to spend two to six hours in the woods, says Li.  His research showed that forest bathing for about that amount of time helped boost immunity.  One study  found that participants who walked in the forest for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon saw an increase in anti-cancer proteins and immune cells that kill tumors, with the effects lasting for at least seven days after.   If you can't set aside a good part of your day to meander through the forest, you can also do shorter walks. But the health benefits won't be as significant, says Li. \"The longer [the time in the forest], the better. The longer has more effect.\"  A 2019 study published in the  International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health  found that walking just 15 minutes through the woods  can help relieve stress and anxiety .  3. Aim to reduce heart rate Your forest bathing session is a good time to sit or walk or do some gentle yoga or tai chi. It's not the time to squeeze in your hardcore cardio for the week. \"The difference between normal activities and forest bathing is that we're going to move very slowly,\" says Evans. Forest bathing is about calming down your nervous system and reducing your heart rate and blood pressure.   If you exert yourself too much physically, your \"tiredness will reduce the effect of forest bathing,\" says Li. Your body will produce more stress hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, which studies have shown that forest bathing  can help decrease .  4. Breathe in the scents of the forest Many of the benefits of  shinrin-yoku  come when we inhale the chemicals that trees release into the air, called phytoncides, says Li. They can reduce our stress hormones and increase our levels of white-blood cells known as natural killer cells, according to his research. \n       \n      Related Story:  Suffering From Nature Deficit Disorder? Try Forest Bathing \n       In  one study  from 2009, his team ordered special concentrated essential oils made from Japanese cypress trees and then pumped them into the hotel rooms of test subjects using a diffuser. The people staying in those rooms saw about 40 to 50% of the health benefits as those who did a forest bathing session. As a side note, if you can't make it to a forest, Dr. Li says you could get some of the benefits by diffusing tree-based essential oils at home. 5. Bolster your forest bath with meditation When you get to the forest or the park, walk a little bit and then find a spot that speaks to you. That could be a clearing in the woods surrounded by a bunch of tall trees or a spot where a tree has grown into a curved shape that looks suspiciously like a seat. If it feels beautiful and resonant to you, that's what matters.  Now sit down, says Evans, and try this exercise. \"Inhale for a count of one, two and then exhale for double the length of time, so it's one, two, three, four. Then keep that going.\"  \"When the exhale is slower than the inhale, it sends a physiological message to your body that says: 'I'm safe. I can relax. It's OK,' \" he adds.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Stressed? Instead of distracting yourself, try paying closer attention \n       This particular breathing exercise  has been shown  to have benefits on its own outside of the forest environment. The reason to do it in the forest is to allow yourself to relax so you can begin to notice all the sounds, colors and textures that nature has to offer.  You may be surprised by what you discover, says Evans. \"Depending on what's happening in your emotional world, quite often when we look at nature or the forest, it sends something back to us to help us make sense of what's going on in our life.\" This episode of Life Kit was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. Isn't the forest a magical place... (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CALLING) SEGARRA: ...Like, when you really venture into the woods and you see these century-old trees towering over you, sunlight twinkling through them and spiders weaving their elaborate webs? The smell of pine needles is in the air. Birds are tweeting. You hear a mysterious sound that you're not going to pay too much attention to, but you really hope is not a bear. There is a moment of awe that happens when you step into a forest. And I think a lot of us can sense that forest bathing or taking in the forest through your senses makes us feel better and calmer. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: I was surprised to learn that there are decades of scientific evidence backing that up. A lot of the evidence comes from Japan, where the term forest bathing originated in the 1980s. Over many years, researchers have shown in peer-reviewed studies that time in the forest is a kind of medicine. Forest bathing helps your immune system by increasing your levels of anti-cancer proteins and immune cells that kill tumors. It's been shown to lower blood pressure and stabilize blood sugar. It can help with depression. It can lower adrenaline and turn down the dial on your body's fight-or-flight response. GARY EVANS: What we could see in the data was that, as soon as somebody came into proximity of a tree and they were just present and mindful, paying attention and appreciating the tree, that their - basically, their parasympathetic activity, which is the relaxation response in the body, was increased. SEGARRA: I know - all of that from spending time with trees. On this episode of LIFE KIT, we will talk about how to forest bathe, using the research as our guide to what works. And we'll share some exercises to get you started. Feel free to head outside to listen to this one. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: If, like me, you're wondering why forests are so good for our health, there's an evolutionary hypothesis for this. Simply put - for much of human history, we lived in nature. So the thinking is because we evolved in nature... QING LI: We have a biological need to connect with nature. SEGARRA: So we love nature because we learn to love the things that have helped us survive. That's Dr. Qing Li, by the way. He's a professor at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo and the president of the Japanese Society of Forest Medicine. He's designed and carried out a lot of Japan's research on forest bathing. Another expert you'll hear from in this episode is Gary Evans, director of the Forest Bathing Institute in the U.K., which was heavily inspired by Dr. Li's work. Gary says, at this point, we can survive without exposure to nature and forests specifically. EVANS: But there's a difference between surviving and thriving. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right, let's get thriving. We're going to start with some forest bathing basics. Gary says, a lot of the time, when we head to the woods or a hiking trail, nature is a backdrop, you know? It's secondary. EVANS: So we might be walking and talking with a friend, running, cycling, horse riding. SEGARRA: But he says if you want to get all the benefits of forest bathing, your primary focus should be connecting with nature. So takeaway one - really let yourself bathe in the forest. It's kind of like bathing in your tub. You're there to relax and dwell in the experience. EVANS: You say, OK, I'm going to go to the park. I'm going to go to the forest. I'm going to appreciate the natural beauty. So that's the first thing - set the intention. SEGARRA: Ideally, you can also set aside an entire morning or afternoon for this because... EVANS: The important thing for people listening to remember is that relaxation is not, like, an on-off switch. SEGARRA: As for how much time, Dr. Li suggests 2 to 6 hours. LI: The longer is the better. The longer is more effect. SEGARRA: His research shows that the health benefits can last for as long as 30 days, so aim to do this once a month - or maybe more often if your sessions are short. EVANS: So you can build up the dose. SEGARRA: Now let's talk for a minute about location. A nice patch of forest or woods is best. But if you don't have one nearby, you could get some of the same benefits from a city park if it has a lot of trees and quiet spaces. LI: So if you have one day to visit a city park, you also can get a beneficial effect. SEGARRA: But, he says, the effects will be smaller. Lastly, before you enter the forest, do some basic wilderness prep. This is not an exhaustive list, but that can include sunscreen - which you should be wearing every day anyway - also bug spray and long pants to protect you from ticks and plants that will give you a rash. And check the weather ahead of time. Make sure it's safe to venture out. Also, remember to stay on the marked trails and check yourself for ticks after, too, if those are a problem in your area. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right. So we're into the woods. Next up, takeaway two - slow down and disconnect. Your forest bathing session is a good time to sit or to walk or to do some gentle yoga or tai chi. It's not the time to squeeze in your hardcore cardio for the week. EVANS: So the next difference between normal activities and forest bathing is that we're going to move very slowly in forest bathing. We want to reduce the heart rate. SEGARRA: Also, Dr. Li says if you tire yourself out physically... LI: Your tiredness will reduce the effect of forest bathing. SEGARRA: So when you get to the forest or the park, maybe you walk a little bit and then find a spot that speaks to you. Could be a clearing in the woods surrounded by a bunch of tall trees or a spot where a tree has grown into a curved shape that looks suspiciously like a seat. If it feels beautiful and resonant to you, that's what matters. Now sit down. EVANS: And then just be present with the environment and leave the phone alone. SEGARRA: All right. You're settled in. Your phone is turned off, or at least put away. It's time to engage your senses. LI: The sight, hear, taste, smell and touch. SEGARRA: We're going to start with smell and inhalation, because Dr. Li says based on his research, many of the benefits of forest bathing come when we inhale the chemicals that trees release into the air. They're called phytoncides. And when we breathe them in, they, on their own, can do things like reduce our stress hormones and increase our levels of anti-cancer proteins. Dr. Li has done experiments on this. His team ordered these special concentrated essential oils made from Japanese cypress trees and then pumped them into the hotel rooms of test subjects using a diffuser. The people staying in those rooms saw many of the same health benefits as the ones who did a forest bathing session, just to a lesser extent. So as a side note, if you can't make it to a forest, Dr. Li says you could get some of the benefits by diffusing tree-based essential oils at home. But, yeah, takeaway three is to breathe it all in and ask yourself, what do I smell? Behind each smell in the forest is an exquisite, wondrous fact. For instance, the flowers on trees emit a fragrance so they can attract bees with the promise of food that's packed with energy. According to researchers at the University of Tel Aviv, a plant called the evening primrose will actually pump up the concentration of sugar in its nectar when bees are buzzing nearby. I learned that from a book called \"Forest Walking: Discovering The Trees And Woodlands Of North America,\" written by Peter Wohlleben and translated by Jane Billinghurst. I also learned that the earthy smell underfoot in the forest - the one that makes you feel like, hell yeah, I'm in nature - that comes from insects, bacteria and fungi breaking down leaves and rotten wood. And that process will enrich the soil with nutrients. So the advice here? Notice what you smell and maybe later, follow your curiosity to learn more. You can also try some breathing exercises because there's a big mindfulness component to forest bathing. In addition to being a forest bathing researcher, Gary is a yoga and mindfulness teacher, and he says the practice of meditation started outdoors. EVANS: Buddha had his awakening underneath a tree. No coincidence that trees were there right at the start of this. SEGARRA: So here's an exercise to try as you're sitting among the trees. EVANS: So if you inhale for a count of one, two, and then you exhale for double the length of time - so it's one, two, three, four. And so you keep that going, inhaling for two, exhaling for four. When the exhale is slower than the inhale, it sends a physiological message to your body. I'm safe. I can relax. It's OK. SEGARRA: This breathing exercise has been shown to have benefits on its own outside of the forest environment. The reason to do it in the forest is to allow yourself to relax. EVANS: What happens on a physiological level is when our parasympathetic fires up and we slow down, nature comes into sharper focus. So there's a change of perception. SEGARRA: And it gets easier to notice things - sounds, colors, textures. And that's takeaway four - engage your other senses. Listen for the rustling of chipmunks, the gurgling of a creek, the groan of branches in the wind. And notice the colors - bright, red leaves exploding from trees, light green ferns creating a canopy cover for the ground. When you observe nature, that can slow down your fight-or-flight response and lower the levels of stress hormones in your body. You can also take this moment to touch some stuff. No, no, no, not the poison ivy. You know what? Why don't we start with the tree? Go ahead and feel its bark. Is it rough or smooth? Does it have any scars from old branches? Another sense you can use in the forest is taste. I mean, you have to be careful. Don't just pick up a mushroom and start eating it. But if you learn about plants and foraging, you can add that to your forest bathing practice. You can also buy teas and tinctures from trained herbalists in your community and then bring them to the forest with you. Lucretia VanDyke is an herbalist, a ceremonialist and author of the book \"African American Herbalism: A Practical Guide To Healing Plants And Folk Traditions.\" LUCRETIA VANDYKE: I always laugh. I'm like, at this point of my life, I'm so into herbalism that if you can't talk about plants, I don't really know what to talk about anymore. SEGARRA: One of her favorite trees is the mimosa tree. VANDYKE: Well, it has these Dr. Seuss-like pink flowers on it. SEGARRA: Also, herbalists use the flowers to help people work through grief. So sometimes she'll take a couple drops of a mimosa tincture in her mouth. VANDYKE: And then I go sit with the plant, and I hold the flowers, and I'm, like, laying there with the plant and staring at it in awe. It becomes, like, this full-circle thing. SEGARRA: That brings us to takeaway five - go deeper. Work with the forest to process what you're going through. Gary says you can see nature as a mirror. EVANS: So depending on what's happening in your emotional world, quite often, when we look at nature or the forest, it sends something back to us to help us make sense of what's going on in our life. SEGARRA: The Forest Bathing Institute, which he runs, leads group trips to forests in the U.K. and around the world. And people have told him that forest bathing helped them work through grief. EVANS: Actually, a number of them that have come on our sessions have found that it's been very helpful to go into the forest and see the natural cycle of life. Somehow it's enabled them to reconcile what's happened. SEGARRA: In the forest, dead trees provide homes for woodpeckers and owls, and when they fall down, they become hiding spots for frogs and other creatures. And they provide a space for mushrooms and moss to grow. In death, they support life. Another metaphor - think about how trees communicate with each other through their network of roots underground. It's a stark contrast with how isolated many of us feel these days. Lucretia shared this exercise. VANDYKE: So a beautiful practice, I feel like, is imagine how all these roots are touching and watering each other. And if we need to, to, like, imagine, you know, even energetically, like, my family lives in North Carolina and I'm in Louisiana. So energetically, like, you know, when I imagine that tree and touching that tree, I can imagine myself and my spirit being at home with them. SEGARRA: If you want to try something a little more spiritual, while you sit in the forest, ask a tree or a plant to tell you about what medicine it holds. VANDYKE: You know, let me feel, you know, your medicine. Let me understand your medicine, 'cause that's a lot how the original people did it. It's not like they had a book way, way, way back in the day that told them this plant does this, this plant does that. SEGARRA: And then you can always compare what you imagine to a book. When you spend time in nature and around trees, that can also be an opportunity to think about the folks who came before you, whether that's deep in the forest or even in your neighborhood. Lucretia lives in the Treme district of New Orleans, known for being among the oldest African American neighborhoods in the country. VANDYKE: And it has been, you know, cut in half by a highway. And it's also been, you know, very gentrified. SEGARRA: She likes to look at the neighborhood's oak trees draped with Spanish moss and imagine what have they seen? VANDYKE: I try to imagine, like, the old Creole neighborhoods and how, you know, people of color came together and watched each other's children and built what is now revered today as the birthplace of jazz. Like, those trees have heard some of the original jazz greats ever. SEGARRA: She thinks of generations of kids playing and families sprawled out under the trees. VANDYKE: It puts me in old New Orleans and in those old community moments that, you know, don't exist, or they exist in a new way. SEGARRA: I'm sensing a parallel here, right? Trees bring people together. We sit under them in the shade and picnic. We gather around them and harvest their fruit. But they're in community with each other, too. The young and the old propping each other up and sending each other nutrients through their networks of roots. There's just so much wisdom that trees and plants hold for us when we pay attention. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right. Time for a recap. If you want to forest bathe, go to a place that has a lot of trees with the intention of appreciating and focusing on nature. The trees shouldn't just be a backdrop to some other activity. Go slowly. Take it easy. This isn't about doing heavy cardio. It's about slowing down your heart rate and getting to a calm place where you can start to see the wisdom that nature offers. You can also try some simple breathing exercises, slow yoga or tai chi, or do meditation exercises that use the metaphors the forest provides. On that note, Lucretia is going to walk us through one more forest meditation. Settle down next to a tree and take some deep, belly breaths. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANDYKE: I like for people to imagine your legs being like old tree trunk roots that roots you deep in the ground like the tree. So when I take a deep breath, I imagine the energy from - and love from our ancestors or from Mother Nature coming up those large roots into your legs, into your abdomen, belly expanding. And then as you exhale, sometimes I do a practice of shedding the things that no longer serve me, shaking off the day. SEGARRA: And then she exhales and says a prayer of gratitude to Mother Nature.

Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 2:58 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on Nov. 13, 2023, and has been updated.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's stressful to fly around the holidays. Airports are packed, tickets are expensive and bad weather can cause significant flight delays and cancellations.  So, if you  have  to travel, is there an optimal time to do so? Scott Keyes, founder of the travel site  Going.com  (formerly known as Scott's Cheap Flights), shares his recommendations, including days to avoid and the best time of day to fly.  Don't travel ahead of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve \"It's one of the worst times to travel,\" he says, due to flight disruptions, crowds at the airport and ticket prices. \"My secret, best advice for travel over the holidays is: if at all possible, just don't do it.\"  If you have to fly for the holidays, do it on the day itself  \"You just see far fewer people traveling then,\" says Keyes. \"And with fewer people, you can see lower fares and fewer disruptions,\" including delays and cancellations. So think about booking tickets to depart or arrive on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Avoid peak travel days  For a lot of folks, the whole point of traveling during this time of year is to be with family on the  actual  holiday, says Keyes. \"The few days before and after a holiday are when you see the most crowds.\" For Thanksgiving, the busiest travel days are the Tuesday and Wednesday before the holiday and the Saturday and Sunday after, he says. For Christmas, it's between Dec. 20 to Jan. 5. A travel delay that stretches out over a few days, like a snowstorm, can quickly ruin a trip, he adds. \"That's when you're going to have the most competition with other travelers\" for a limited amount of seats if you're trying to rebook a flight.  To avoid this situation, Keyes recommends flying a few days before or after these peak travel times. So instead of flying on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, you might consider traveling a few days earlier.  Travel in January — the 8th, to be precise If you can wait, travel in January, says Keyes. You will probably have a much better flight experience.  Keyes even has a preferred date for that month: Jan. 8, he adds. \"It's my favorite date of the entire year. I circle that date on the calendar because whereas flight prices really get inflated over the Christmas-New Year period, around Jan. 8, they just fall off a cliff from the most expensive time of the entire year to the absolute cheapest.\"  \"It's not atypical to see airfares 80% lower on Jan. 10 compared to the same route on Dec. 30,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Take an early and direct flight  \"There are two types of flights that have the highest odds of getting you to where you're going on time or at least without a major delay: early morning flights and nonstop flights,\" says Keyes.  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's  Air Travel Consumer Report  for September, flights between 6-9 a.m. had an 86% on-time departure rate, versus 50% for flights between 8-11 p.m. With morning flights, \"your plane [has been] at the airport overnight. It's sitting there and ready to go when you get there in the morning,\" he says. Afternoon flights, on the other hand, depend on planes that are flying in from somewhere else and may be subject to delays.  Direct flights have the advantage of not having layovers. \"If you take a connecting flight that gets delayed an hour and a half but you only had a one-hour layover, all of a sudden you've missed your connecting flight and you have to get rebooked\" — not an easy feat during the holiday season.  Prepare yourself for potential flight disruptions that may keep you at the airport. Keyes likes to pack \"noise-canceling headphones and a little snack box, because frankly, airport food is not very memorable,\" he says. And he likes to download a few books and movies to his iPad — \"just in case I'm having to hang out at the airport longer than expected.\"  The audio was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

My boss and I disagreed on a major financial investment and the conversation escalated. They criticized my working style and said that I just didn't have enough experience to understand the decision. And I took those comments personally.   I remember walking out of the office feeling anxious and panicked. And what was strange was that I couldn't seem to snap out of it — those emotions hung over me for weeks. I eventually had to reach out to a therapist for help.  It turns out I was experiencing distress, says  Dr. Kali Cyrus , a Washington, D.C.- based psychiatrist. It's what happens when you experience   negative emotions and physical symptoms like stress, fatigue and anxiety over a long period of time, to the point that it affects your everyday life. Cyrus calls it \"discomfort at extreme levels.\"  Distress may stem from a fight, like in my case; a major life disruption, like losing a job or going through a breakup; or a high-pressure situation, like having to plan a big event.  Cyrus says you can prevent discomfort from ratcheting up to distress by paying more attention to your body and mind — and learning how to be OK with being uncomfortable.   \n       \n      Related Story:  What to do if you're struggling with your mental health at work  \n       You want to do that because \"stress adds excess work to our body, exacerbating its wear and tear,\" she says.  Research shows  that long periods of stress can lead to high blood pressure, elevated hormone levels and conditions like chronic fatigue, depression and immune disorders.   Is it discomfort or is it distress?  Let's say you've been triggered by a stressful incident. Notice what's going on in your body and mind. Do you feel uncomfortable?  \"When you are not feeling good, your body is trying to tell you something,\" says Cyrus.  After my fight with my boss, for example, my chest felt tight, my stomach hurt, I had trouble sleeping and focusing, and I felt like I was on high alert.  These symptoms are a sign of discomfort, says Cyrus, which you may be able to manage with simple grounding techniques (a few are outlined below). But they can turn into distress if they stick around for more than a few hours or days. Mine lasted for weeks.  When you are in this state, your \"nervous system gets dysregulated and that messes up the balance of hormones in your body,\" she adds, preventing it from \"regulating in these times of need.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  Life Kit: Dealing with anxiety \n       Distress can also show up \"in the form of depression, chronic pain or anxiety\" that impact you \"most days of the week and get in the way of your ability to work or spend time with friends,\" she says.  If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, Cyrus recommends seeing your primary care doctor. Get a physical exam and blood work done to narrow down any possible health issues. If your symptoms aren't related to your physical health, talk to your doctor about seeking mental health intervention, like therapy or medication prescribed by a psychiatrist.  How to keep distress in check  The good news is that there are ways to prevent feelings of discomfort from escalating into distress. Cyrus shares a few techniques.   Change the scene If you catch yourself spiraling — you can't seem to catch your breath, you're feeling anxious or you're having trouble focusing — find a way to snap out of it. \"Go outside, go to the bathroom, call a friend, take a few deep breaths,\" says Cyrus.  Your nervous system is being flooded with stress hormones, making it hard to calm down or see things clearly. So you need to interrupt the feelings that are overwhelming you by changing your environment, she adds.  I didn't realize I had done this after my fight with my boss. After our argument, I left the office immediately and went for a long walk. Just noticing the trees and the birds around me got me out of my head.   Recount what happened  Go over your situation again and create a narrative, says Cyrus. This can help pinpoint what is giving you distress and jog your memory of details you may have overlooked that can add levity to the situation. Do this with a friend, a family member, a therapist — or even yourself, by journaling or \"talking out loud as you walk your dog,\" says Cyrus, as she likes to do.  Name your emotions As you describe what happened, name your emotions, she adds. She recommends using the feelings wheel, a tool that can help you express your emotions more specifically (for example, instead of saying you simply feel \"bad,\" maybe you actually feel \"indifferent.\")    \n       \n      Related Story:  These habits can cut the risk of depression in half, a new study finds \n       I turned to a therapist to help me unpack my fight with my boss. She helped me realize that it wasn't my boss or the argument that was making me upset, but the feeling of being dismissed and made to feel small. That allowed me to see a different perspective on the issue.  Identify your triggers  Examine what gives you discomfort. For example, if you have terrible road rage, Cyrus says to have a conversation with yourself about it. You might ask yourself: Why am I prone to being so angry on the road? Is it because I am in a rush? Or is it because I hate sitting in traffic?  Then, find ways to alleviate the situation. To avoid being rushed, maybe leave the house a half hour early. To avoid traffic, ask your boss if you can work from home a couple times a week.  As for me, I've learned that I tend to be sensitive to feedback when it includes a reference to my lack of experience. It makes me defensive and angry.  So now, when I find myself in this circumstance, I remind myself to breathe deeply, pause, tell the other person that I need time and space to consider their feedback — and that I'll come back to them when I'm ready. This helps me feel more in control of my feelings.  The audio portion of this episode was produced by Sylvie Douglis. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan.

LILIANA MARIA PERCY RUIZ, HOST:   Hi, everyone. I'm Liliana Maria Percy Ruiz, in for Marielle Segarra. And I'm here to talk about something uncomfortable, literally. A few years ago, I had a bad day at work. A conflict erupted with my boss that left me feeling anxious and panicked, and I couldn't get rid of it. My chest felt tight. My stomach hurt. I had trouble sleeping and focusing. And I felt like I was on high alert. I knew something was wrong. I just didn't know what it was. KALI CYRUS: I actually don't even know if clients say, I'm coming to you because I'm in a state of distress. PERCY RUIZ: Dr. Kali Cyrus is a psychiatrist based in Washington, D.C. Dr. Kali says that when we are triggered by something in our lives, it is hard for us to decipher between what is discomfort, meaning something we can tolerate and work through, and what is distress. CYRUS: In thinking about those words, one seems like a precursor to another. Discomfort at extreme levels or heightened levels can lead to distress. It's ratcheted in intensity is past discomfort, or I think in frequency is when it starts to transition into the unhealthy, which is when I think of distress. PERCY RUIZ: Distress has the word stress in it for a reason. And when we're in a state of distress for longer periods, it puts a negative impact on our body that can become toxic, leading to high blood pressure, elevated hormone levels, and conditions like chronic fatigue, depression and immune disorders. Thankfully, there are techniques to help mitigate distress. In this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to talk about how to get our bodies more comfortable with being uncomfortable so that we can avoid getting to a state of distress. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PERCY RUIZ: Dr. Kali, let's talk about what happens when my body is really uncomfortable. For me, it feels like my body is on fire. It's hard to focus because I'm so overwhelmed. What do you recommend people do to dial down that feeling? CYRUS: In these moments, if you are really panicky, you need to change the scene. Change the scene. Go outside. Go to the... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Bathroom. Call a friend. You need to neutralize your nervous system that is overactivated because it's not seeing things accurately, which means you might send an email. You might curse someone out. You might spend a bunch of - you might do something because your nervous system is like, (vocalizing). PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: You just want to calm down. And so try to do something that that changes the context that might be triggering what is going on. So go outside, take a few deep breaths. I say sometimes, like, even just get on Instagram. PERCY RUIZ: I love this. You're encouraging people to go on Instagram. What a difference (laughter). CYRUS: It's a - but it's... PERCY RUIZ: Because you're stopping what's going on in the moment, right? CYRUS: Right. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: You're recognizing why you're going on there. You're not just, like, doomscrolling. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: So when it's happening, you need to interrupt it. PERCY RUIZ: That's takeaway one - when you're feeling that level of discomfort and it feels like you can't get out of it, make a change. Do something to break it up. But I know it's easier said than done. So I asked Dr. Kali, once you're ready for more analysis, how do you do that? CYRUS: Try to put a story or a narrative to what you're feeling. And sometimes you have to think back to something that you may even think is insignificant and and start there and kind of trace back your steps because - and with the unknown, our brain wants to tell us a story. It's filling in the blanks about why there's discomfort there... PERCY RUIZ: Got it. CYRUS: ...Usually probably with the worst case scenario or something... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Really stressful. And what you have to do is to kind of back up and actually get your front brain - like, the brain that puts words to things, that tells us how to do complex steps and tasks, that is like, no, you're being irrational. You have to get the front brain involved and say, hey. No. This is a thing that happened at work - she said this; he said that; my boss did this - while you're also examining how your emotions feel, or that fear or that thing you're worried about is influencing what actually happened from your perspective. PERCY RUIZ: Got it. CYRUS: And as long - until you put those things into words, it just sits there. PERCY RUIZ: So takeaway two - try and put words to your feelings. You can talk to a friend or family member or a therapist, but you can also do this on your own. CYRUS: So I tell folks to journal. Yeah. Or I even - you know, what I do is I speak out loud when I'm walking the dog because I can't get myself to sit down and journal for the life of me. But what you have to do is just get it out of that vague place, and what you have to do is you have to name it. So sometimes, you know, that's why it's so uncomfortable because it doesn't have any words attached to it. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah, yeah. CYRUS: So you - I think of it as like pulling it out of a cabinet and actually, like, naming what that thing is. PERCY RUIZ: So by telling the story, which also in my mind goes to, like, just stating the facts - here are the facts that happened, the things that I know - is that how you would talk about it? Like, do you say facts, like, without the emotion? Just for example, I was at work, and my boss said this thing to me, and then I felt this way, and then I went here, and, like, kind of like retracing your steps. CYRUS: Yeah. Yeah, no, that's exactly it. And I think you also did a thing that was really - you've got some good therapy, or you're just very self-aware and - great, so... PERCY RUIZ: Lots of years. Lots of years. (LAUGHTER) CYRUS: Most people miss the feelings part. So, yes, you go through and explain what happened from your point of view. Try to just see it just as - the way it happened. But, yes, you have to name the thing that you were feeling because that's what - the affect is the thing that's being stored. And so by naming it like, I felt really angry, or, I felt really insecure; I felt like I was stupid - I think this is the hardest part, actually... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Is having to say the feeling out loud. And I'm a huge proponent of the feelings wheel. I bring it up. I share my screen with my clients and I say... PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: ...How did you feel when this happened? PERCY RUIZ: Google it, people. It's so helpful. CYRUS: And it feels so cheesy, but it's really useful because then you can say, I felt stupid. And then you say to yourself, you know what? I'm human. Is it... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: I'm allowed to feel that way. I felt that way. It's OK. I'm looking at it from another angle, and I can see that I was this - it's realistic I felt that way. I was entitled to feel that way. It actually makes sense that I felt that way. And then you keep going. PERCY RUIZ: Now, I went into my conversation with Dr. Kali thinking we'd be parsing out the difference between discomfort and distress. But what I learned is that if you don't learn to deal with normal levels of discomfort, you will be in distress. So takeaway three is practice sitting in discomfort. CYRUS: Discomfort is really important to think about as not something that's completely negative. Everyone should try to encourage themselves to calm their fear response. And try to understand and take up information about why they might be feeling, like, discomfort because that's telling you something about this moment, and it might be something exciting that you're about to learn. So this... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Is my way of saying, I think of discomfort as, like, a low intensity of something being brought up in you - of an intensity of feelings, or that you might be having to - something your brain is perceiving and your body is picking up on. But if it is a thing that maybe you don't have control over stopping and it continues to grow and you have to sit in this state for long periods of time and you maybe don't see an end or it continues to grow every day and it's there - you know, you go to work. Maybe something happened. You go to work the next day. It builds, and you're still not getting any other information. That's really scary. That is the state in which this becomes distress. And that's when your nervous system gets dysregulated, which is not good for your body because then that messes up the balances of hormones and the way your body, your nervous system, is responding that is ideally supposed to help you regulate in these times of need, not every day... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah, yeah. CYRUS: ...Because then you get, like, high cholesterol. You get high blood pressure. You get all these weird things that happen to your body over time. PERCY RUIZ: So I'm curious. When do you know, how do you know when something is too much? - because I'm thinking about the fact that - for myself and, I imagine, many people listening - like, you want to grow. You want to become more resilient. You know, these are things that we hear about, read about. We long to be people that are getting better and better, right? CYRUS: Yeah, yeah. PERCY RUIZ: But how do we identify what things are just - they're just not for us, or they're not going to be areas of growth? They are actually too distressing. CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: Is that even a thing that we should think about? CYRUS: Yeah. Yeah. It's when your body is super tense. You're really tired. You are snapping at everyone because you feel like everyone is being snappy to you. So you're you feel really irritable, one, but also targeted and unsafe. You're perceiving hyper, like, threats. You're probably not sleeping well. You're not eating well. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: When your body is not functioning, you're... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Doing - something is not working. Something is not working. And, again, like, when you think about depression or some folks who just have anxious brains that are shaped that way, there may not always be a reason... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...That you can point back to. It could be a season. You know, it - but when you are not feeling good, your body is trying to tell you something. PERCY RUIZ: And that's when you really - you do need to seek medical help. CYRUS: Yeah, yeah. And so what we usually do is once I - we encourage folks to go to the primary care doctor first. If you hadn't had a physical, get all blood tests taken to make sure it's not a thyroid thing or an anemic thing going on that is making this happen. And then after that... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...It's really telling your nervous system, something is going on. Something in your life is shutting your body down or is making - it's putting you in and out, in and out of, like, a danger response. And you need to find ways to stop that. And it might be the first thing you only have is medication to calm down in the moment - again, because if you're too triggered, you can't do anything. PERCY RUIZ: Exactly. CYRUS: So some folks need medicine, even if it's temporarily, to get them to a state when they can start to do the processing and being able to, like, actually stop and leave the room without engaging too much or take that break or be able to practice their breathing skills or practice other things to see if it works. But when you're in the thick of it, you have to find a way to get - bump yourself down a level from distress to something else. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah, so that you can even be in a place where you can be uncomfortable because you're not even uncomfortable. You're just on a whole other level. CYRUS: Yeah. You were terrified, probably. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: Yeah. Or shut down, you know? PERCY RUIZ: Are there preventative steps - things that you can do in your daily life to - I don't know if prepare is the right word, but just kind of build, you know, the ability to be uncomfortable to, to be... CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: ...In that place where, you know, like we were just saying, we all have to deal with this every day of... CYRUS: Yeah, yeah. PERCY RUIZ: ...Our lives, right? Anyone who interacts with another human being is going to be uncomfortable in some way, right? CYRUS: Because they're unpredictable. We are so unpredictable. Oh, my God. PERCY RUIZ: So how do you build that ability to be present to that, to be resilient in it? CYRUS: Yeah. So your psyche is trying to protect you from distress. You want to find healthy ways to confront that or cope with it. Sometimes you have to resort to avoiding it, being numb to it, but not for too long. You have to - if you put it in the cabinet, you have to come back and get it and look at it. You can't just keep it there for years and years until it's expired because it's not going to - still going to sit there. You have to come back to it. So you have to know it's a thing that's there. And this is where the kind of evidence collection comes from. And this is what I'll say to clients. You're not going to immediately be able to fix this. So what I'll say... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Is let's understand it. PERCY RUIZ: That's takeaway four - to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable, get curious about yourself and your triggers. Start noticing what's happening around you. CYRUS: What happens right before this thing? What happens that morning? What do you notice when it doesn't happen? When do you feel at your best? PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: What in general makes you happy? And you just try to latch on to those. And so it might be if you know you have terrible road rage - and this is a very difficult one because you still have to go to work. PERCY RUIZ: And still get in a car and drive (laughter). CYRUS: You still have to get in the car. And I'm still working with some clients on this one. What about if you exercise that morning? Does it matter what you listen to in the car, or what you eat? PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: And what can you place in your day - multiple things that might help, kind of like when you're playing Mario Kart and you have to gather some, like, stars or fruit. You just have to... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: Yeah. I think if we're talking about going into a situation that I know will make me anxious - like, let's say I'm going to meet a relative of someone or going to an event that I may be unsure about. I will - I'm going to be insecure about what I'm wearing. Do I look like them? Do I look like I'm wearing something cheap? Do I - am I overdressed? You know, am I going to be the only Black person? And I have a little spiel for each of these. Well, I'm going to wear something that makes me feel like who I am today. I don't want to wear something too tight or a button is broken, shoes are uncomfortable. I want to get there early. PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: I want to make sure I have something that can calm me down if I feel like I might get there immediately, even if I don't use it. I tell my partner ahead of time, I'm going to need you to keep an eye on XYZ. I might tell a friend there. You know, I might say, you know, you can leave. You can call an Uber. You've thought about the phrases... PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: ...That you can say. You've asked whatever info, as much as you can, to find out about the event. So, one, trying to get info about the thing that might be distressing you, and then also literally just doing the things that you know might calm you or help you feel more prepared. PERCY RUIZ: But the patterns that you're talking about, though, talking to yourself and naming the things, that seems to be the place you begin to build that resiliency, is really getting comfortable with having a conversation with yourself... CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: ...About what you notice... CYRUS: Exactly. PERCY RUIZ: ...And the feelings. CYRUS: Exactly, and you have to recognize what's happening in your body as well, which is why things that get you in your body and aware of your senses and what you're experiencing are really useful, like working out. It also helps you healthwise in general. But this is the logic of why we do those things. Again, kind of hard for me to access sometimes, but I know clients who say, I started working out in the morning and I realized I could look at this hard report. It really helps me. I don't know how, but I realized that - so really knowing your body, talking to yourself, and being able to get information about what works or what doesn't work. PERCY RUIZ: How would you say that sitting with discomfort has made a difference in your life? CYRUS: I suppose what I've benefited from is I'm able to - when I'm triggered or start to recognize this thing happening, I know that that means, I need to come up with a way to address it. When I'm feeling so despairing, that means that I'm not doing something creative, or I'm not having fun or play - rewarding myself with these things that bring me out. And so I think sitting in it can help me appreciate a way to get out of it later. You know, it'll be easier next time. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: And then it'll help me explain the next time I get to this place that I know I can get out. And I understand why I'm here. And it's OK. But it's not scary anymore. PERCY RUIZ: Thank you, Dr. Kali. You're just amazing. I love talking with you. CYRUS: Oh, no, this was really great. I like talking about this stuff. PERCY RUIZ: Yes, same. OK, deep breath, y'all - we can do this. To recap, when you're feeling really uncomfortable, make a change. Then name your feelings, either by journaling or talking it out with a friend or by yourself. After you've put words to it, practice sitting in the discomfort. And lastly, get some data about what makes you uncomfortable. Think about the things you need to prepare in advance for situations like getting enough sleep, meditating, moving your body or bringing a friend along.

An AP investigation in September  found that American companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known. “It’s driven by profit, and that’s why these strategic discussions have been silenced or delayed,” Zhou said. “I’m extremely disappointed. … this is a strategic failure by the United States.”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Hundreds of millions in lobbying The sale of technology to China is contentious among both Republicans and Democrats, with some arguing for a harder stance.  They are fighting a powerful opponent. An AP analysis of lobbying filings showed U.S. tech and telecom companies, as well as their trade associations, spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two decades on lobbyists who listed key bills impacting China-related trade on their quarterly disclosure reports, among other issues. \n    \n     Have a news tip?

Intel,  which partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company as recently as last year , has said the company follows export control policies, and did not address details of its deal with the U.S. government.  “The U.S. government’s investment is a passive ownership, with no board representation, governance or information rights,” Intel said in a statement.

And  Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute , a government-backed research institute working on sensitive technologies such as encryption, sought access to $280,000 worth of Azure OpenAI cloud services from Microsoft. Even sanctioned Chinese companies can use AWS and Microsoft Azure to offer surveillance abilities to customers overseas. For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China’s two largest surveillance companies,  use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad , according to  marketing material on the company websites . Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure,  according to a post on Hikvision’s website this year .  Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft’s policies and doesn’t support China’s access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole. Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn’t include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed. The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce  asked for comment  on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015,  it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products , but most fell through. In 2024,  it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems  and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success. Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies. “I think we’ve been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.”  “What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what’s behind the fact we haven’t made as much progress.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A rickshaw driver transports wounded people, with the help of bystanders, to a nearby hospital in Beijing, on Sunday, June 4, 1989, after PLA soldiers fired rounds towards crowds gathered outside Tiananmen Square.

They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons. But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police.  For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints. In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance.  Smith drew parallels with IBM’s sale of computing gear  to Nazi Germany, which  has been well documented by historians . IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.”  Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith’s proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations. Smith’s bill went nowhere. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Rep.

Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee  Gold Key Matching service. In 2004,  the Commercial Service invited American companies  selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms  in the “safety and security” market , followed by another publication later describing  market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems . Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in  policing trade shows , even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party.  Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a  webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools  to China’s public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows.  Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns. “I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?’” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry. Despite promises to nail shut Washington’s revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing’s surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London.

Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment.  That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China’s central government  “to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems”  on its website.  A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        Documents reviewed by the AP show how the U.S. government helped promote opportunities in the Chinese security market to American companies. (AP video Marshall Ritzel)\n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016. “The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it’s cameras, it’s software, it’s facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone’s face, you blow up international trade.” Wolf’s colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n\n\n     \n        .headline {\n            font-family: \"AP\";\n            font-size: 28px;\n            color: #333;\n            text-decoration: none;\n            text-align: center;\n            display: block;\n            background-color: #ffffff;\n            padding: 5px;\n        }\n        \n        .headline:hover {\n            color: #0066cc;\n        }\n        \n        .image-link img {\n            width: auto;\n        }\n     \n\n\n\n Photo Gallery: Life Under Surveillance \n\n \n\n \n     \n \n\n \n\n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry.  In 2021, Joe Biden put out  an executive order  describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden’s administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf’s draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China. But once again, Washington lobbyists, lawyers and politicians pushed back. “The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns,” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year. The proposed rule, in the end, stalled out.

After she was released in 2019, she still found herself living in what she calls “an open-air prison,” with every move monitored, until she finally left Xinjiang later that year. She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability. “It’s truly disappointing that the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences,” Haitiwaji said.  —- Burke reported from San Francisco and Washington, Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

The article highlights concerns about the potential impact of these changes on vulnerable populations, particularly in areas such as asylum access and detention conditions. The Human Rights Commission has been involved in reviewing the proposed policies to ensure they align with international human rights standards.

Psychotherapist Katherine Morgan Schafler believes there is more than one kind of perfectionist in the world — five, to be precise.  In her book,  The Perfectionist's Guide to Losing Control: A Path to Peace and Power , Morgan Schafler outlines the different types, including the \"Parisian perfectionist\" — those who seek to be easygoing and uncomplicated — and the \"messy perfectionist\" — those who are great at starting projects but not finishing them.  Morgan Schafler  developed these terms after years of working with employees at Google, where she was a former on-site therapist, then with high-powered clients at her private practice on Wall Street. Many of them strived for flawlessness in their personal and professional lives — but often saw it as a negative quality that they had to curtail. After all, research has linked perfectionism to  anxiety, depression and other mental health concerns .   Take the quiz above, then select your result to learn more:  Intense perfectionist ;  Classic perfectionist ;  Parisian perfectionist ;  Procrastinator perfectionist ;  Messy perfectionist But Morgan Schafler believes that perfectionism can also be a good thing. Perfectionists see how the world around them can be better – and when wielded in a healthy way, the characteristic can be a powerful vehicle for change, she says. It's \"a force that can be constructive and also destructive, depending on how you manage it.\"  The key, she adds, is to understand your own brand of perfectionism. Her book includes a quiz to help readers identify their profile, understand its pros and cons – and learn how to use this quality to their advantage.  Understanding your perfectionist type  1. Intense perfectionist: Striving for success at all costs  Intense perfectionists are effortlessly direct and maintain a razor-sharp and sometimes punishing focus when it comes to achieving their goals, says Morgan Schafler.  \"People like Steve Jobs or Gordon Ramsay\" come to mind, she adds. \"They are great at generating outcomes, but sometimes they prize it so much that they lose the sense of relationship-building in the process.\"   An intense perfectionist, for example, might have the goal of boarding a flight perfectly. They show up early to the airport with their boarding pass in hand. But at the first sign of trouble – a flight delay, a seat change – the intense perfectionist might lash out at the people around them, like a flight attendant or traveling companion.  If you scored a high percentage for this type, Morgan Schafler says to interrogate why you're striving for your goals. If you're seeking generic markers of success (bigger, better, faster, more), redirect your energies to more specific goals aligned with your own personal values. If you lose sight of the why, you may reach the finish line and find it doesn't bring you joy or satisfaction.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Classic perfectionist: Highly organized and buttoned-up  This is who typically comes to mind when we think of a perfectionist. They're \"highly organized, buttoned-up and are going to do what they say they're going to do,\" says Morgan Schafler.  \"The pros of the classic perfectionist are that they're highly reliable and they add structure to any environment they enter. The cons are that they can sometimes be not spontaneous and not as collaborative\" with others, she adds.  Classic perfectionists may keep an immaculately tidy desk or a car that they're proud to show off to the people around them. However, should someone put a pen in the wrong place or spill coffee on the passenger seat, these types of perfectionists are quick to stress out.  For this type, Morgan Schafler says to be careful not to conflate rigidity with inner strength. An overly-structured life leaves little room for discovering new lessons, people or joys.  3. Parisian perfectionist: People pleasers to the max Named after the effortless fashion sense of Parisian women, Parisian perfectionists seek to be viewed as easygoing, uncomplicated and \"perfectly liked\" by others, says Morgan Schafler. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Parisian perfectionists are great at making people feel seen and comfortable – but sometimes at the expense of \"their own sense of identity,\" she adds.  In a social group setting for example, this type is likely to be the life of the party. But when it comes time to make a group decision – say, picking a restaurant to eat or a movie to watch – a Parisian perfectionist will be quick to defer to the opinions of others to avoid conflict, even if that means foregoing a food they were craving or a movie they desperately wanted to watch.  This type can have a healthier relationship with their perfectionism by clearly explaining their wants and needs, even if that means asserting themselves more in their relationships. For example, instead of saying \"I've had a hard day\" to their roommate and expecting them to pick up the hint that they need help, they should say, \"I'm having a hard day because I've taken on the lion's share of the housework. I could really use your help with some of these chores.\" 4. Procrastinator perfectionist: Always waiting for the right time Procrastinator perfectionists \"wait for the conditions to be perfect before they start\" working on a project, says Morgan Schafler — which doesn't often happen. As a result, they can get stuck in their hesitation — and left unchecked, it can result in indecisiveness and inaction.  Procrastinator perfectionists don't suffer from a crisis of confidence. Rather, they are great at understanding their own potential but struggle with sharing their gifts lest they fall short of their own expectations.  This type of perfectionist might spend hours drawing up the perfect business proposal to pitch to their boss at work – but never actually submit it out of fear of rejection. Morgan Schafler says this type should focus on accepting that  now  is as good a time as any to start something, say dating or finding a new job. And once things start rolling, they should accept that the process in real life will be different from the idealized version they were imagining.  5. Messy perfectionist: Quick to start, slow to finish Messy perfectionists are \"in love with beginnings,\" says Morgan Schafler. They're naturally enthusiastic and push through the anxiety of starting a new project with ease. But they can often struggle with follow-through when the tedium of continuing a project doesn't match \"the perfect romanticized energy around starting.\"  This type is often in the middle of a lot of half-baked projects: a half-finished children's book, a kitchen renovation that's been stuck in limbo for half a year. Messy perfectionists blatantly ignore limitations and don't accept the notion that while they can do anything, they can't do everything.  Morgan Schafler says messy perfectionists are powerful as champions of possibility – but none of their great ideas can come to fruition without focus. They should practice channeling their enthusiasm into single, intentional projects with easily achievable goals.  The audio portion of this episode was produced by Clare Marie Schneider .

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. ANDEE TAGLE, HOST:   Hey there. I'm LIFE KIT reporter Andee Tagle, and I'm here to tell you that you, LIFE KIT listener, are perfect. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: That's right. You're perfect exactly as you are. But maybe not exactly the way you might be thinking. KATHERINE MORGAN SCHAFLER: When we think of the word perfection, and if you take it to its Latin root, it means completely done. It doesn't mean flawless. TAGLE: That's Katherine Morgan Schafler, a New York City-based psychotherapist and author of \"The Perfectionist's Guide To Losing Control: A Path To Peace And Power.\" SCHAFLER: I don't think anybody's flawless, but I do think everyone is born into the world as a whole human being who, from that moment on, deserves as much joy, love, connection, freedom and dignity as any other person could ever be. You don't earn those things. TAGLE: Katherine has spent years in private practice on Wall Street, a location that attracts a lot of high-powered, high-achieving women with careers in things like big law and finance. Many of those clients, perhaps unsurprisingly, are perfectionists. What she's found through her work is that perfectionism, like the word perfect itself, is misunderstood. SCHAFLER: I think that we try to squeeze perfectionism into this little ring box. You know, the colloquial definition of being a perfectionist is someone who wants things to be perfect at all times. They want the weather to be perfect. They want themselves to look perfect. You know, they want to achieve their goals perfectly, et cetera, et cetera. And that's just not accurate. It's an oversimplification of a really complex, fluid, individualized force and a force that can be constructive and also destructive, depending on how you manage it. TAGLE: Perfectionists can be Type A - intense and rigid and meticulous. That's usually what I think of when I think of perfectionism. But they can also be messy or forgetful or laissez faire. They can procrastinate or up and quit whole projects entirely. What do different types of perfectionists have in common? For one thing, potential, says Katherine. Perfectionists see how the world around them can be better. And perfectionism, when used in a healthy way, can be a powerful force for change. But perfectionists are also very good at getting in their own way. In her research, Katherine found a common thought pattern of, I'm just not good enough yet, a common thread of people who couldn't let themselves off the hook for not achieving their understanding of, quote, unquote, \"perfect.\" SCHAFLER: Well, I'm almost whole. I just have to, you know, lose 10 pounds. I'm almost worthy of feeling relaxed and joyful. I just have to make my whole family happy this holiday season and get through it, and then I'll be good. Or as soon as the renovation is done, as soon as I get this job, as soon as I get pregnant - it's like this list never ends. And that's not a way to live. TAGLE: So she wrote a book to help. In this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to rethink and reframe perfectionism. We're going to talk to Katherine about the relationship between women and ideals of perfection. We'll discuss the many different ways perfectionism can manifest itself. And we'll learn the difference between control and power. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Katherine, in the book, you say a lot of messaging around perfectionism is gendered. Let's start there. SCHAFLER: Yes. Well, you know, I think language really helps control the way that we think about whether something is good or bad and, in turn, whether we are good or bad. And it kind of has this regulatory function where it teaches us, like, how to be more of what we are, quote, unquote, \"supposed' to be. In the same way that the word bossy, for example, regulates authoritative qualities in girls and women and why there's no - you know, there's no male version for the word bossy. That's kind of what perfectionism is turning into. And so I wanted to write this book to nip that in the bud and just to say - before this becomes, you know, something that floats around for the next five or 10 years without us realizing what we're doing, which is quelling the ambition and expressions of power in women by pathologizing perfectionism ad nauseum and then telling women to find balance, which is a directive that is given to women so much all over the place - in advertising, in food, in podcasts, in mommy blogs, just everywhere. TAGLE: Katherine, what's wrong with the messaging about just finding balance? SCHAFLER: Well, balance, in its original definition of energetic equilibrium, is healthy. But balance as it has come to mean now is just being good at being busy. To say that a woman is balanced is not to say that she's hit her sweet spot of energetic equilibrium. It is to say that she can juggle so many tasks. And give her another thing, and she won't drop the ball. Look at her go. And that has nothing to do with health. And what kind of balance we're offering to women is elusive. It never comes. And we don't notice that it's not here and that it's not real because we're too busy blaming ourselves that it's not here yet because we're constantly getting the message of, like, if you just had an Insta Pot, you could be balanced. TAGLE: (Laughter). SCHAFLER: If you just had this app, you could be balanced. If you just, you know, woke up one hour earlier, you could be balanced. And I think perfectionists are people who are not balanced and who are constantly told, you know, slow down. You're doing too much. You need to be balanced - as if we're - you know, as if balanced means health when it doesn't anymore. TAGLE: Yeah, absolutely. Just find balance. That's all you need to do. Just find balance. I know that we're kind of circling around it, but would you mind just introducing us to the idea? How can perfectionism be powerful? SCHAFLER: So I think of perfectionism as a natural human impulse, one that is healthy. And perfectionists - the way I define and understand the term - are people who, more often than not, see the gap between the reality and the ideal and long to bridge the gap and not only long to bridge that gap but feel actively compelled to do so. And how you pursue the ideal and why you pursue the ideal - those are the factors that determine whether your perfectionism is healthy or not. If we go to the how, are you pursuing the ideal in a way that hurts you or exploits or hurts other people around you? And if we go to the why, are you pursuing the ideal because you think achieving, you know, one goal after the next is going to certify your belonging into some group or some sense of self-worth or some kind of external validation? And there are healthy reasons to pursue the ideal. And I think it's actually, you know, one of the forces that make the world go around. TAGLE: I'd love to get a better understanding of how perfectionism - the different ways that perfectionism can manifest in our lives. So I'd love to just briefly walk through the five different types of perfectionists - first up, the classic perfectionist. SCHAFLER: Yes. So the classic perfectionist is what comes to mind when we all think about the perfectionist. So this is somebody who is highly organized, buttoned-up. And they are going to do what they said they're going to do when they said they would do it in the way that they said that they would do it. And each type of perfectionist has pros and cons. And the pros of classic perfectionists is that they're highly reliable and they add structure to any environment they enter. The cons are that they can sometimes not be as spontaneous or welcome collaboration. And those are qualities which tend to engender connection. And so being with a classic perfectionist, whether it's in a family system or a work system, can sometimes end up feeling more transactional. And this hurts both the people around the perfectionist and the perfectionist themselves because classic perfectionists can tend to feel undervalued for all that they do. Then there's the procrastinator perfectionist. And the procrastinator perfectionist waits for the conditions to be perfect before they start. And, of course, that never happens. So procrastinator perfectionists tend to ruminate. And that's part of, you know, the negative qualities of this type. And the - on the positive side, they can prepare so well. They can see things from a 360-degree angle. They can really understand all the different legs of decisions. And they are not impulsive, which can be a real asset. But, of course, they have real challenges around getting projects off the ground because they just encounter so much anxiety around beginnings. TAGLE: What about messy perfectionists? SCHAFLER: The messy perfectionist is in love with beginnings. They can start anything effortlessly, just breeze through all the anxiety that a procrastinator perfectionist might. But the problem with messy perfectionists is that when they hit the middle of a process and the tedium that is involved in staying committed to goals and carrying out those goals, they can kind of lose interest and lose energy because the middle isn't perfect. It doesn't match the perfect romanticized energy around starting. And I want to make a side note to say that all of these types of perfectionists can be expressed in lots of different contexts. So you can be a messy perfectionist when it comes to dating and love going on the first date, love the second date, and then the third date, you're like, this person is chewing really loudly. TAGLE: (Laughter). SCHAFLER: And I don't like this, and I don't know where this conversation is going and this and that and whatever. TAGLE: OK, how about intense perfectionists? SCHAFLER: This is the perfectionist that's kind of - I think, publicly, we think of someone like Steve Jobs or Gordon Ramsay, Anna Wintour, as intense perfectionists. They have razor-sharp focus. They are really great at generating outcomes. Sometimes they can prize the outcomes so much that they lose the sense of team building, for example, or relationship building in the process, and they get the outcome at the great expense and opportunity cost of everyone around them's sort of satisfaction and sometimes even, you know, level of comfort or safety, depending on whether they're having outbursts or not. TAGLE: OK. And then finally, Parisian perfectionists. SCHAFLER: So the Parisian perfectionist, the easiest way to describe it is that they want to be perfectly liked. And that is how this perfectionism manifests on a surface level. But on a deeper level, it's about wanting perfect connection - wanting perfect connection to themselves, to their community, to their partners. Maladaptively expressed, Parisian perfectionism looks like people-pleasing at the expense of sacrificing one's own sense of identity and pleasure. But on the pros side, Parisian perfectionists are genuinely warm people who focus on inclusion, collaborate well, love working with others. And they're effortlessly inviting all of those things in. TAGLE: Well, Katherine, your book taught me that I am mostly a Parisian perfectionist. And I feel both seen and attacked by this information. SCHAFLER: (Laughter). TAGLE: How is knowing your category helpful? How can people start to use this information to their advantage? SCHAFLER: Yeah, that's such a great question. I offer all of these categorizations as perspectives and not the truth. I really offer these as starting places to begin to understand patterns and to say, what do I like about this pattern? What do I want to continue about it? How does this show up, again, in all of these different ways - with my parenting, with my friendships, with dating, with work, with my family, in my own relationship to myself? And it's just a starting place to begin to ask and answer those questions. TAGLE: Katherine, you have a lot of tools in the book about ways to work with and reframe our type of perfectionism. One of those was understanding the difference between explaining and expressing something. Could you walk us through that idea? SCHAFLER: So explaining is saying what's happening, right? So I am leaving work early. Expressing is saying what's happening and what you feel about what is happening. I am leaving work early because I am feeling stressed. And when you only explain, you know - I need this by tomorrow - and you don't express - I need this by tomorrow because I had a conversation with the client today, and I'm starting to feel anxious about whether they're going to back out - when you only explain, it emphasizes this transactional - no team, no collaboration, no sense of actually knowing or connecting to the person. All that matters is the outcome, and we just need to get it done. And it really makes people around you feel disconnected. And it can make you feel disconnected to yourself. And if you only, on the other hand, express, which is what a lot of messy perfectionists and Parisian perfectionists tend to over-index on, then you're talking a lot about how you feel and what the experience of being you is like, but you're not actually asserting your wants or needs. And so you might say, I'm feeling really burnt out. OK, well, why don't you explain that you're feeling really burnt out because you have been covering for someone who's been sick for three weeks, and you can no longer do that. You've realized that that's not tenable, right? And so I think that part of our communication patterns in some of these personality types can pop up. And they're not necessarily bad. We don't need to subtract anything. We don't need to get rid of parts of who you are. We just need to add to help you connect more with yourself and others and help you understand yourself and help others understand you better, too. TAGLE: OK, I want to move on to the difference between control and power. In the book, you talk about how understanding the difference between these two can help us understand when our perfectionism is healthy and when it might be getting away from us. SCHAFLER: Right. So control and power, like lust and love, look very similar - they're not the same thing. Control is about manipulating. Power is about influencing. Control is myopic - you have to plan everything one step at a time because what you do next depends on all the factors that you are, you know, aware of and have information for, whereas power is really visionary. It allows you to take the luxury of taking great leaps of faith and being able to say, no matter what happens with the outcome, I know who I am and what's important to me, and I trust myself that I'll understand what to do next, whereas control is more frantic. It has a desperate energy and an attendant anxiety that other people around you can feel. And when we feel powerless, we double down on superficial control, and it backfires every time. In the moment, it feels like being controlling is the responsible thing to do when you can't find your own power. TAGLE: What do we gain when we cede control? SCHAFLER: So I think one of the reasons why people feel locked out of joy is because they haven't forgiven themselves for past versions of themselves that did or did not do something. And if you don't forgive yourself, you don't trust yourself. And if you can't trust yourself, you can't give yourself license to have power. You micromanage yourself. You try to control yourself. It's just like a boss who doesn't trust their employee. They're going to be checking in every second on what they do. And they meet that person with suspicion instead of confidence. When you have that kind of relationship with yourself, you just cannot bring your full self to the table. You can't relax. And if you don't trust yourself, you're trying to move through life memorizing the right thing to do instead of trusting yourself and the way that you feel and whether on the most basic level you feel good or not. Does being around this person make me feel good? Does being at this job make me feel good? You don't trust yourself to do that, and so you just end up in your head. You're thinking. You're making pros and cons lists all day. You're denying your instincts any say in the matter. And you just can't, in my opinion, think yourself through your life. You have to be open. And to be open, you have to be able to say, I don't know what is coming next. There is, you know, some degree of surrender required for that. And you cannot be in surrender and in control at the same time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Katherine, thank you so much for talking with me today. SCHAFLER: Thank you. This has been such a pleasure. TAGLE: To recap, perfectionism is powerful. You just have to learn to use it to your advantage. There's nothing wrong with longing to bridge the gap between your reality and your ideal. But be wary of how and why you pursue, quote, unquote, \"perfection\". Ask yourself, are you hurting or helping the people around you in pursuit of your ideals? Does this action serve to connect or distance you from your values? Are you pursuing this ideal for the right reasons? Or are you seeking some kind of arbitrary external validation? Finally, remember you are perfect as is, meaning you are complete and therefore worthy of rest and joy exactly as you are in this current moment. Don't wait for that mythical perfect balance or to achieve perfect personhood. Lean into your power and start trusting your own instincts today, right now. You got this.

The seven member commission is made up of experts in architecture, art, urban and landscape design. Since its creation in 1910, the commission has reviewed plans for everything from Arlington National Cemetery to Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial. As first reported by  The Washington Post , the commissioners who were terminated are Bruce Redman Becker, Peter D. Cook, Lisa E. Delplace, William J. Lenihan, Justin Garrett Moore and vice chair Hazel Ruth Edwards. The chair position, now vacant, was held by Billie Tsien, one of the architects  working  on the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago. Lenihan confirmed in an email to NPR the six were terminated \"effective immediately.\" In an email to NPR, the White House said it is \"preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies.\" The  commissioners  would have advised President Trump on  his anticipated  White House ballroom and his  plans  for a monument similar to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which he says will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. In an email to NPR, architect Bruce Redman Becker, one of the commissioners who was fired, wrote that \"Neither project has been submitted for review yet.\" President Trump has not yet announced who the new commissioners will be. During his first term, Justin Shubow, founder and president of the National Civic Art Society served as chair and White House  ballroom  architect James McCrery was one of its commissioners. In 2021, President Biden  fired  four commissioners who'd been appointed by Trump in his first term, including Shubow. Like Trump, Shubow is a champion of traditional and  classical architecture . The White House has not yet responded to NPR's request for comment. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   President Trump has fired all of the members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. That's the independent federal agency that looks over plans for monuments, memorials, coins and federal buildings - things like Arlington National Cemetery or the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. All six members were told over email that they were terminated, quote, \"effective immediately.\" Now, there are usually seven commissioners. One position was vacant. Here to tell us more about all of this is NPR's Elizabeth Blair. Hey, Elizabeth. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. DETROW: So does this perhaps have something to do with a big controversy right now, the White House ballroom that we keep hearing about, the one where the East Wing used to be until it was demolished? BLAIR: Well, it's fair to say that the commission would have advised the president on the ballroom, but the ballroom is just one of Trump's ambitions when it comes to changing the look of Washington, D.C. He has also proposed a major new monument - an arch, much like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Now, it's possible he doesn't want anyone to get in the way of his plans, but that's not the role of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. DETROW: OK. Well, tell us a little bit more about what their role is, how they fit into this. BLAIR: The commission is made up of people at the top of their field in architecture, the arts, urban and landscape design. And the idea is that the president and Congress rely on them for their expertise when it comes to design. I talked to Sara Bronin, a law professor at George Washington University and the former chair of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which is a similar agency. Here's what she said. SARA BRONIN: Overall, their scope is generally advisory in nature. However, their opinions should be taken into account by decision-makers. We have seen that their expertise has led to improvements in proposals. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like that will be the case with the president's proposed ballroom. BLAIR: It's important to note here that the lead architect of the White House ballroom, James McCrery, was himself a fine arts commissioner during Trump's first term. So the president is familiar with how the commission works. In fact, in his first term, the White House built a new tennis pavilion that the commission worked on. DETROW: At times, President Trump fires people and restaffs them with allies. At times, he fires people and just never fills the positions again. Any sense which one it is here? BLAIR: They said they are restaffing. In an email, a spokesperson said they are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First policies. DETROW: Now, this is not the first time that a president has fired this whole commission, though, isn't it? BLAIR: That's right. When President Biden took office, he fired four of the commissioners that Trump had appointed, and this is where it gets to a matter of taste about architecture. During President Trump's first and second terms, he issued executive orders that require the designs of federal buildings be traditional or neoclassical. So out with the new, in with the old. No boxy brutalism like the old FBI building, which Trump has said is just plain ugly, and a lot of people have agreed with that. But many architects continue to push back on this idea. They say today's buildings shouldn't be modeled after ancient Greece or Rome and that the style of a building shouldn't be dictated. It should be whatever the particular structure, purpose, location or community calls for. DETROW: I mean, all of this makes me wonder what - how it works. If I have an idea for a memorial - I don't know, a memorial to public radio or whatever, can I just apply to the commission? How does that work? BLAIR: No, you cannot. DETROW: OK. BLAIR: You - not as a private individual, but you can if you are with a federal or D.C. government agency. But you can observe the process. DETROW: OK. BLAIR: The commissioners meet monthly to review proposals, and those meetings are open to the general public, but not during the shutdown. DETROW: That is NPR culture correspondent Elizabeth Blair. Thank you so much. BLAIR: Thank you.

Akinwotu, Kate Bartlett \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 3:57 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         After a more than 500-day siege, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) — the paramilitary group at war with Sudan's army — have taken control of el-Fasher, and by extension, the entire region of Darfur. The fall of the city marks a turning point in Sudan's brutal war and has sparked warnings of a repeat of the Darfur genocide two decades ago. The United Nations estimates around 200,000 civilians were trapped in el-Fasher when the army withdrew. Advocacy groups say many are now being systematically killed. Among the dead is Muhammad Khamis Duda, a spokesperson for the Zamzam displacement camp near el-Fasher,  who documented the siege for months, sending voice messages to international media until his death.  He survived an attack on the camp by the RSF in April where they slaughtered hundreds. But still he refused to leave, determined to stay and help others.  \"The situation in el-Fasher right now is very horrible,\" Duda said in one of his final messages to NPR before his death. RSF tighten its grip on Darfur The RSF and allied Arab militias — descended from the notorious Janjaweed   — now control all of Darfur, a vast western region already scarred by decades of ethnic violence. Videos circulating online, which NPR has not independently verified, appear to show RSF fighters killing hospital patients and civilians while shouting racial slurs. Sudanese analyst Kholood Khair   says the violence is not just a continuation of the civil war — but of genocide. \"The genocide we saw twenty years ago is actually still continuing,\" she said. Evidence of mass killing from space Satellite imagery  reviewed by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab shows mass graves and signs of house-to-house killings in el-Fasher. \n       \n       Twitter \n       Lab director Nathaniel Raymond says his team has been tracking the atrocities in real time. \"Every day, my team and I watch el-Fasher's destruction from space. No one can say they didn't know.\" The RSF has been accused of war crimes throughout Sudan's two-year conflict and is believed to be backed by the United Arab Emirates — a key U.S. ally — though the UAE denies any involvement. Emi Mahmoud, a Sudanese-American advocate and strategic director for the Internally Displaced Persons Humanitarian Network, who is from Darfur herself, says the world's inaction is catastrophic. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is our Srebrenica moment. Just like the siege of Sarajevo, which was happening in full view of the world, el-Fasher is being destroyed while everyone watches. If no one intervenes, there will be no one left to save,\" Mahmoud  told NPR's  Morning Edition . A humanitarian collapse unfolds The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration says  more than 26,000 people have fled  el-Fasher since it fell over the weekend. Many are arriving at the nearby village of Tawila ,  where mothers with infants, malnourished children and the elderly are seeking aid. Doctors Without Borders  says it has treated hundreds  of injured civilians, while aid workers face \"extraordinary danger\" to reach those in need. Inside el-Fasher, videos posted by the RSF show fighters carrying out executions, while advocacy groups warn of massacres across the city. The U.N. says   1,350 people were killed there even before the city's fall earlier this month. The World Health Organization   says  more than 460 patients  and their companions were killed at the Saudi Maternity Hospital in el-Fasher. The WHO said it was \"appalled\" and reminded all parties that patients and health workers are protected under international law. What comes next The war over who controls the resource-rich nation at the crossroads of the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Red Sea has killed tens of thousands. It has also displaced 14 million people. Both sides in the conflict have been accused of committing atrocities. With el-Fasher under RSF control, analysts warn the group is now positioned to dominate one-third of Sudan, strengthening its claim to power and deepening the country's fragmentation. The taking of el-Fasher will only give it more leverage, says Cameron Hudson, former special envoy to Sudan and an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  \"This victory for the RSF allows it to consolidate total control over one third of the country, all of Darfur. That will bolster its claims that it's a government, and give it greater leverage at the negotiating table.\" In the meantime, the RSF appears intent on pursuing a scorched earth policy in el-Fasher, with the real extent of the atrocities likely only to become clear in the weeks ahead.   \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   In Sudan's Darfur, a paramilitary group has taken control of the city of El Fasher. The group had been laying siege to the city for 18 months. Sudan's army has withdrawn, and hundreds of thousands of people trapped there are now being systematically murdered. For the next seven minutes or so we're going to describe some of the atrocities happening in the city. NPR's Emmanuel Akinwotu spoke with one man in El Fasher shortly before he was killed. Emmanuel filed this report, and I want to let you know that it includes the sound of gunfire. EMMANUEL AKINWOTU, BYLINE: When there was still hope for the thousands trapped in El Fasher, Mohamed Duda was a tireless voice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MOHAMED DUDA: Hello, dear Emmanuel. I'm so glad to be in touch with you. I will share with you every day a news update if you want. Just don't hesitate. Call me. AKINWOTU: He sent voice messages to international media and NGOs, reporting the suffering being inflicted by the Rapid Support Forces. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DUDA: The situation in El Fasher right now is very horriful (ph), you know? AKINWOTU: He sent them even after he'd been shot, as the RSF and allied Arab militias took over the largest refugee camp in Sudan, where many from African ethnic groups - including Duda - were sheltering. And he reported on how the siege on the historic city in Darfur was starving. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DUDA: Daily the children dying of hunger, and also elders dying of starvations (ph). AKINWOTU: This week, the city finally fell to the RSF. More than 200,000 people were trapped there, according to the U.N., including Mohamed Duda, who an advocacy group reports was killed. The takeover of the city has led to yet another wave of RSF atrocities during the more-than-two-year war with Sudan's army. Much of the evidence has been volunteered, recorded by fighters, posted online by RSF-affiliated accounts. They document ethnic-based violence against African ethnicities in Darfur that the U.S. and U.N. have called a genocide - a repeat of the Darfur genocide 20 years ago.

UNIDENTIFIED RSF MEMBER #1: (Non-English language spoken). AKINWOTU: In one of many videos, fighters film themselves walking through a hospital in El Fasher and killing anyone still alive. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT) AKINWOTU: Nathaniel Raymond is the director of the Yale University Humanitarian Research Lab, which have identified piles of bodies near military vehicles in El Fasher seen on satellite imagery. NATHANIEL RAYMOND: Other than one U.N. Security Council resolution last summer calling for a ceasefire, the international community has fundamentally done nothing. AKINWOTU: Now thousands still alive are in imminent peril. Both sides in the war have been accused of atrocities, the majority by the Rapid Support Forces. They are backed and armed by the United Arab Emirates, a key U.S. ally, according to widespread evidence. The UAE denies involvement. RAYMOND: Every day, my team and I at the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale watch El Fasher's destruction from space. No one can say they didn't know.

27, 2025 • 9:18 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on November 7, 2023, and has been updated to include a rerun of our episode on this topic.  Scams can happen to anyone — even to people who study them.  Kelly Richmond-Pope , a forensic accounting professor at DePaul University, fell for one in 2017. While searching for tickets to a Bruno Mars concert, she found a website that was offering front-row seats for a low price. After she paid for the tickets, she realized ... they were fake!  Looking back on the incident, Richmond-Pope, who also researches fraud and white-collar crime, says \"the website I got the tickets off of  did  look different from Ticketmaster.\"  Fraud is a big business. According to  a 2023 report  by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Americans reported losing nearly $10 billion to fraud, an increase of more than 14% in 2022. The most common schemes were investment scams and impostor scams.  \"Criminals will steal from anyone, whether you have $5 or $500 or $500,000,\" says  Amy Nofziger , the director of fraud victim support for AARP, which focuses on issues affecting people over 50. She oversees their fraud hotline, where they get calls from people of all ages.  Here are eight simple actions you can take to protect yourself from getting conned.  1. Regularly check your bank accounts for fraud  Look through your accounts, especially your checking and credit card accounts, every two weeks. \"Take an hour and do a deep dive. Look at all the transactions and make sure everything there is valid and legitimate,\" says Richmond-Pope.  2. Check your credit report every four months  Look at your credit report every four months to see if anyone has made charges or opened accounts in your name, says Nofziger. You can get a free report from each of the three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, every year.   3. Freeze your credit (then 'thaw' it when you need it)  This ensures that no one can open up a credit card or take out a loan in your name. To freeze your credit, go to the websites of each of the major credit bureaus, make an account and request a freeze.  \"If I need to refinance or get a loan, I just go and 'thaw' it — that's what the companies call it — for ten days. My creditor can check my credit and then it'll automatically be frozen again,\" says Nofziger.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Why you should think twice before posting that cute photo of your kid online  \n       4. Use your credit card whenever possible Use your credit card rather than your debit card, says Richmond-Pope. \"Your credit card company has a level of protection that the banks don't seem to give. So I've always used my credit card for as much as I can, then just pay that credit card balance off at the end of the month.\"  If someone makes a fraudulent charge on your credit card, the most you'll be liable for is $50,  according to the FTC . But if someone gets a hold of your debit card, they can take money straight out of your checking account, leaving you without access to that cash while you sort things out with your bank. You also may be liable for  much more of the losses , depending on when you report the fraud.  5. Call the number on the back of your bank card  If you suspect that someone has made a fraudulent charge on your bank card, don't search for your bank's phone number on the internet. Call the number on the back of your bank card or on your account statement, says Nofziger. \"Criminals are placing fake customer service phone numbers [online]. You call it thinking you're talking to your actual bank\" but it's a fake number. 6. Sign out of Venmo when you're done using it  If you thought you were only at risk while browsing the internet, you are wrong. Picture this, says Nofziger. Say you're walking down the street and a teenager comes up to you and says \" 'Oh my gosh, I lost my phone. I need to call my mom to pick me up. Can I borrow your phone?'  'Well, of course,' you say. 'Here's my phone.' You see them dialing a phone number. But actually what they've done is they've gone into your Venmo app\" and they've transferred money to themselves.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Your Technology Is Tracking You. Take These Steps For Better Online Privacy \n       For this reason, Nofziger recommends signing out of your peer-to-peer payment apps when you're done using them.  7. Set up your phone to decline calls from people you don't know  To reduce your chances of answering phone calls from scammers, go into your phone settings and select the option to send unknown callers to voicemail. \"That means that anybody that is not in your contacts that calls you will go directly to voicemail,\" says Nozfiger. \"If it's important, [the caller] will leave a voicemail.\"  8. Be careful about what you post online People can gather a lot of information from your social media accounts, says Richmond-Pope. If you share a birthday photo on your actual birthday with your age in the caption, people can find out your birth date. They can find out who your friends and family are by looking at your followers list and your tagged photos.  They can also find out when you're out of town. Your vacation photos on Instagram announce to the world that you are not home, she adds. \"Most people are not posting their pictures two weeks after they come back. They're posting their pictures while they're on vacation.\"  If you do get scammed, make sure to report it, says Nofziger. And give yourself grace. \"You were a victim of crime. End of story. You need help, kindness, empathy and guidance.\"  The audio was produced by Clare Marie Schneider. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual producer is Kaz Fantone.

Hey, everybody, it's Marielle. Kelly Richmond Pope is a huge Bruno Mars fan. She loves the song \"24K Magic,\" among many others. So in 2017, when she realized he was coming to her city, she got on Ticketmaster. And the universe was smiling upon her that day because she got these amazing front-row seats for pretty cheap. KELLY RICHMOND POPE: And I'm thinking, oh, yeah, I got a bargain. So my cousin and I go to the Bruno Mars concert. We're super excited. We get in, go through the United Center door, and we get a big X over the ticket. SEGARRA: The ticket was fake. RICHMOND POPE: And when I go back and I think what happened, the website that I got it off of - it did look a little bit different than the traditional-looking Ticketmaster website. And so what should've been the red flag was - how do I have these amazing seats? It's almost like if you got Taylor Swift or Beyonce tickets, front row, for a hundred bucks apiece. And that was how good of a deal this was. SEGARRA: She ended up tweeting at the real Ticketmaster, and they gave her and her cousin free front-row tickets for all the hassle. But the point is, Kelly got scammed. And what's notable about that is - you know what she does for a living? She's a forensic accounting professor at DePaul University. RICHMOND POPE: And my area of expertise is fraud, forensic accounting and white-collar crime. SEGARRA: Yeah, in other words, scams - her expertise is scams. So scams even happen to people who study them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Scammers are everywhere, especially online. In 2022, there was an estimated $8.8 billion lost to fraud. These scammers want your money, but also your personal information. RICHMOND POPE: What can you do with that? You can open a credit card. You can apply for a loan. I've even had interviews that I've done with white-collar felons where people have applied for mortgages in people's names. SEGARRA: Even if you think you've got a skeptical eye and this could never happen to you... AMY NOFZIGER: Every single person is vulnerable to scams. SEGARRA: Amy Nofziger is a certified fraud examiner and the director of Fraud Victim Support with AARP, which focuses on issues affecting people over 50. And she oversees their fraud hotline, where they get calls from people of all ages. Amy says there are a lot of myths out there about who gets scammed. NOFZIGER: People that are uneducated, that don't have resources, that aren't worldly - but in my two decades of experience, whether you're a doctor, a lawyer, a CEO, a teacher, it really doesn't matter. SEGARRA: Today's episode of LIFE KIT is all about scams. We'll talk about how to spot the red flags and proactively protect yourself and what to do if you are a victim of fraud or identity theft. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: As Amy was saying, anyone can get scammed. That's our takeaway one. Understand that it could happen to you. These warnings are not just for folks with memory issues or people who don't understand technology. And scammers - they want your money whether you have a lot or a little. NOFZIGER: Criminals will steal from anyone, whether you have $5 or $500 or $500,000. SEGARRA: Also, as I mentioned earlier, they may want your personal information, like your Social Security number, so they can steal your identity and then take on debt in your name. The other thing is, it doesn't matter how old you are. There are scams targeted at your age group. Back to Kelly Richmond Pope, who we heard from earlier - she's a university professor, and she warns her students about scholarship scams. RICHMOND POPE: If you are in college or graduate school and you see an advertisement for a scholarship, that scholarship could be asking for so much information about you. It could ask, if you have a tax return, do you have one? What's your name? What's your birthdate? What's your parent's name? What's your mother's maiden name? How old are you? Where do you go to school? And sometimes you don't know that this is a fake scholarship. It doesn't exist. SEGARRA: The same thing can happen with fake job applications or websites that pretend to offer student debt relief. Another common scam involves cryptocurrency, where someone tells you they've got a great opportunity for you to invest in crypto, and then they steal your money. Amy says sometimes this starts with a simple wrong-number text. NOFZIGER: You'll get a text message to your device, and it says, hey, are you coming for dinner tonight? And you, as a good human, writes back and say, I'm sorry. You know, I think you have the wrong number. Who is this? And they'll write back, and they'll say, oh, isn't this Sally? Oh, I'm so sorry. You know, I thought I had my friend Sally's phone number. But you sound really nice. Like, where are you located? SEGARRA: Then the conversation's flowing, and they ask you a seemingly innocuous question, like... NOFZIGER: What do you like to do for fun? I play baseball. I do this. Oh, I dabble in crypto. I learned it from my aunt, who's a, you know, world-known crypto investor. SEGARRA: Maybe you've always wondered if you were missing out on the whole crypto thing. And next thing you know, you're transferring money to this person's digital crypto wallet, and you'll never see it again. There are also impostor scams where you get a phone call or a text from somebody pretending to be an institution, like your bank or a government agency. NOFZIGER: It could be a text message from someone saying that there's a package waiting for you from the Postal Service. It could be someone calling you and saying that they're with the DEA, and they found a car that was rented in your name and Social Security number, and drugs were in it. You know, whatever it is, the impostor scams are rampant. SEGARRA: And these can be sophisticated. One of our producers got a phone call recently from somebody saying, hey, it's your bank. We think there's been a fraudulent charge on your account. Did you make this purchase? So she logged into her account online and saw that there was a fraudulent charge on there from that place, but something felt off. The person on the phone had pronounced her name wrong and was asking for personal information, so she hung up and called her bank directly. Turns out that person was a scammer, and presumably they had made the fraudulent charge. It's clever, right? That brings us to takeaway two. Learn the red flags of a scam. Amy says, if someone contacts you, whoever they're claiming to be, listen carefully. If they ask for payment, that's a red flag. NOFZIGER: If they are asking or say - in any part of the conversation - prepaid gift card, government card, stop. If they say anything about a QR code or an ATM machine, stop. If they say anything about a peer-to-peer app, like Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle, 100% stop. The government does not take payment with Venmo. If they say Social Security number or Medicare number - you know, oh, we need to verify this for, you know, legitimate purposes - stop. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Another red flag is requesting that you go get cash from an ATM or go to a store and ship them something. NOFZIGER: Just stop. Just stop right there. SEGARRA: Now, here's a very specific but common one. If they're claiming to be the IRS, stop. RICHMOND POPE: You call the IRS. SEGARRA: The IRS typically reaches out to taxpayers through good, old snail mail, but these phone calls prey on our fear and uncertainty. RICHMOND POPE: When you get that IRS call, you're like, oh, my gosh, have I paid? Did I not pay? What's going to happen if I don't? So they know that that's how you're going to respond. SEGARRA: That brings us to another red flag. Scammers will often try to trigger your emotions. They want you to feel scared or nervous so that you're not making clear-headed decisions. Those feelings should make your antenna go up. This happens in romance scams, where somebody you've been chatting with online tells you they're stuck in another country, and their passport got stolen, for instance, and they just need you to Venmo them enough money to get home. It also happens in kidnapping scams, where someone pretends they've taken your family member captive. If you feel your emotions rising, pay attention. Another red flag is urgency. Is the person on the phone saying something needs to happen right now? That's another sign of a scam. And in those moments, don't be afraid to hang up. NOFZIGER: Get out of that situation. Like, literally get out of that situation. Hang up the phone. Delete the email, and check on it. SEGARRA: Amy says, in general, you should treat everyone you meet online or through your phone as you would a stranger in person. NOFZIGER: So imagine you're in your downtown area and someone runs up to you and says, oh, my gosh, I have the best crypto opportunity for you right now. Do you want to go meet my aunt? 'Cause she can invest your money, right? Or someone runs up to you and says, oh, my gosh, you are the prettiest person I've ever met. I think I love you. If you're face to face, you'd be like, step away from me now. SEGARRA: Once you have stepped away or hung up or disengaged and you want to look into whatever this is, be careful. Like, let's say you got an email with a scholarship opportunity. Don't immediately click the links in the email. And just do some research. Kelly suggests that you find a way to verify that scholarship is real using 3 to 5 other sources. RICHMOND POPE: A lot of times, when we're desperate, we don't do the verification piece. And that's what the scammers are preying on - is our desperation and our busyness and the lack of time. SEGARRA: Now, let's take a different scenario. Say you get a call from someone claiming to be your bank. You're going to hang up and call the bank directly. Now, this is important. Don't just Google the customer support number because scammers have placed fake customer service numbers online. NOFZIGER: So when an individual goes to, you know, a search engine and types in the phone number for PNC Bank, whatever it is, and just says PNC Bank customer service, the criminals are placing these fake customer service phone numbers. You call it thinking you're talking to your actual bank because you did your due diligence. You called the number. You looked it up. SEGARRA: But it's a fake number. So always call the number on the back of your bank card or on your account statement. And same goes for government agencies, airlines and other institutions. Make sure you're at their correct website and find the number that way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Now, if you thought you were only at risk while browsing the internet, not so fast. Picture this - you're walking on a trail, and a teenager comes up to you and says... NOFZIGER: Oh, my gosh. I lost my phone. I need to call my mom to pick me up. Can I borrow your phone, please? Well, of course. Here's my phone. You know, you see them dialing a phone number. But actually, what they've done is they've gone into your Venmo or your other peer-to-peer app, and they're basically just transferring money out of your account to them. SEGARRA: That brings us to takeaway three - proactively protect yourself from scams and fraud. So the first thing Amy says here is that, if a stranger does want to borrow your phone... NOFZIGER: First of all, put it on speaker. You dial the number. You keep control of your phone. But also, always sign out of any banking apps. SEGARRA: That means Venmo and Cash App and whatever else - make sure you sign out of those apps every time you're done using them. This is just one of many precautions you can take to protect yourself from scams. And yeah, some of these things will be inconvenient, and they may seem like overkill. But... NOFZIGER: It's just like how we - you know, none of us want to be broken into in our houses, but we lock our doors at night. We have alarms. We set up barriers. We need to do the same thing when it comes to scams and frauds and our financial safety and security. SEGARRA: Another tip from Amy - set your phone up to silence or block calls from unknown numbers. NOFZIGER: It's a simple thing. You can go into phone settings, and there's just a toggle that says send unknown callers to voicemail. That means that anybody that is not in your contacts that calls you will go directly to voicemail. And some people will say to me, well, what if it's important? Well, if it's important, they will leave you a voicemail. SEGARRA: Also, reconsider what information you're sharing online - for instance, on your social media accounts. RICHMOND POPE: Think about this - how many people go on vacation and tell the whole world they're on vacation? All you're alerting to the world is you're not home. And so you have to think about how we make ourselves vulnerable to scams because we make it a lot easier than we used to. SEGARRA: Be super careful about what you share, and also consider making your social media accounts private. Also, Kelly says, regularly check your bank accounts for fraud. RICHMOND POPE: One of the things even personally that I try to do is, every two weeks, take an hour and sort of do a deep dive. Look at all the transactions. Look at all of my credit card debits, credits and see - make sure that everything there is valid and legitimate. SEGARRA: And whenever possible, use your credit card rather than your debit card. If someone makes a fraudulent charge on your credit card, the most you'll be liable for is $50, and often you'll pay nothing. But if someone gets a hold of your debit card info, they can take money straight out of your checking account, and then you won't have access to that money while everything gets figured out. Also, you may be liable for much more of the losses, depending on when you report the fraud. RICHMOND POPE: So I've always used my credit card for as much as I can do, and then just pay that credit card balance off at the end of the month. SEGARRA: You can get a free report from each of the three major credit bureaus every year. Use those throughout the year to see if anyone has made charges or opened accounts in your name. Even better, freeze your credit. That ensures no one can open up a credit card or take out a loan in your name. And this is something both of our experts recommended. To freeze your credit, you're going to go to the websites of each of the major credit bureaus, make an account and request a freeze. You can do the same thing for a couple more minor credit bureaus. Amy's credit is frozen. NOFZIGER: I have it on there. I know my credit is safe. And if I do need to refinance or get a loan, I just go and I thaw it. That's what they call it. They say thaw it. I'll tell the company to thaw it for 10 days while my, you know, creditor can check my credit, and then it'll automatically be frozen again. SEGARRA: And if you have kids, consider freezing their credit as well because they can be targets, too. RICHMOND POPE: I have read stories of children that - they've been living their lives. They're 18 years old. And they realize that all of these credit cards have been opened in their name, and their credit is ruined because someone stole their identity and they didn't even know about it. SEGARRA: People are getting scammed all the time, and it might happen to you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Takeaway four - if you do get scammed, report it. And if necessary, go through the steps of recovering from identity theft. NOFZIGER: Report it to your local law enforcement, your Attorney General's office. Report it to us on the Fraud Watch Network Helpline. You are going to need support, and you're going to need guidance on what to do and where to go. And it certainly depends on what type of scam that you were a victim of. SEGARRA: For instance, if you were the victim of a credit card fraud, they would tell you... NOFZIGER: Contact your financial institutions. You know, put a fraud alert on your credit report. If you were a victim of a scam that involved a gift card, you know, you can get the guidance to call the number on the back of the gift card immediately. Tell them that it was used in a fraud. See if there's any funds remaining. SEGARRA: The bad news here is that, if you lost money in a scam, you may not get it back. NOFZIGER: And that's why the criminals love the forms of payment that they ask for. Because getting money back from a prepaid gift card is not usually going to happen. Getting money back that you deposited into a crypto ATM machine is not necessarily going to happen. That doesn't mean it doesn't, and that doesn't mean you shouldn't report it. SEGARRA: Sometimes, though, the best you can do is learn how to protect yourself going forward and put new barriers in place. The last thing we want to say here is, if you got scammed, give yourself grace. NOFZIGER: You were a victim of a crime - end of story. You need help, support, kindness, empathy, guidance. You need a shoulder to cry on. You need a support group just like if you were a victim of a home break-in. SEGARRA: She says, as the victim of a scam, you might worry that people will say it's your fault and that you should've known better. That's what we do to fraud victims as a society. NOFZIGER: We blame them. And so what we're really trying to do at AARP is to bring those victims out of the shadows and say, get out here. You know, share your story. Report your crime. Because that's how we and other, you know, people in this fight are going to understand the magnitude of this issue. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: OK, time for a recap. Takeaway one - understand that you can get scammed regardless of your age or income or level of technological savvy, and there are scams targeted at people just like you. Takeaway two - learn the red flags of a scam. You get a call or an email or a text, and someone is asking for money or personal info. They're asking you to go somewhere, like an ATM or the post office. They make it seem like this task is super urgent - all red flags. Takeaway three - proactively protect yourself from scams and fraud. Check your bank account transactions and your credit report for suspicious activity. Freeze your credit. And use your credit card instead of your debit card whenever you can. And takeaway four - if you do get scammed, report it. Go through the steps of recovering your identity if you need to, and be kind to yourself. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

   \n           Updated Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 9:04 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba — Hurricane Melissa left at least dozens dead and caused widespread destruction across Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica, where roofless homes, toppled utility poles and water-logged furniture dominated the landscape Wednesday. A landslide blocked the main roads of Santa Cruz in Jamaica's St. Elizabeth parish, where the streets were reduced to mud pits. Residents swept water from homes as they tried to salvage belongings. Wind ripped off part of the roof at a high school that serves as a public shelter. \"I never see anything like this before in all my years living here,\" resident Jennifer Small said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The extent of the damage from the deadly hurricane was unclear Wednesday as widespread power outages and dangerous conditions persisted in the region. \"It is too early for us to say definitively,\" said Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister. Melissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph (295 kph), one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, before weakening and moving on to Cuba, but even countries outside the direct path of the massive storm felt its devastating effects. At least 25 people have died across Haiti and 18 are missing, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement Wednesday. Twenty of those reported dead and 10 of the missing are from a southern coastal town where flooding collapsed dozens of homes. At least eight are dead in Jamaica. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Cuba, officials reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads and roofs blown off buildings Wednesday, with the heaviest destruction concentrated in the southwest and northwest. Authorities said about 735,000 people remained in shelters. \"That was hell. All night long, it was terrible,\" said Reinaldo Charon in Santiago de Cuba. The 52-year-old was one of the few people venturing out Wednesday, covered by a plastic sheet in the intermittent rain. Forecasters expect Melissa, now a Category 1 hurricane, to bring dangerous winds, flooding and storm surge to the Bahamas on Wednesday night. Jamaica rushes to assess the damage In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dixon said 77% of the island was without power. The outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station. \"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\" Officials in Black River, Jamaica, a southwestern coastal town of approximately 5,000 people, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday. \"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said. Solomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations. Jamaican Transportation Minister Daryl Vaz said two of the island's airports will reopen Wednesday to relief flights only, with U.N. agencies and dozens of nonprofits on standby to distribute basic goods. \"The devastation is enormous,\" he said. \"We need all hands on deck to recover stronger and to help those in need at this time.\" The United States is sending rescue and response teams to assist in recovery efforts in the Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X. St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network. Before landfall, Melissa had already been blamed for three deaths in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic. Melissa devastates Haitian town Hurricane Melissa damaged more than 160 homes and destroyed 80 others in the town of Petit-Goâve, where 10 of the 20 people killed there were children, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Lawyer Charly Saint-Vil, 30, said he saw bodies lying among the debris after the storm as he walked the streets of the small coastal town where he grew up. People screamed as they searched for their missing children, he said. \"People have lost everything,\" Saint-Vil said. Although the immediate threat of the storm has passed, Saint-Vil said Petit-Goâve's residents were living in fear about access to medicine, water and food in the coming days given the political instability in Haiti. \"We don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,\" he said. For now, neighbors are helping one another source necessities and find places to sleep. Saint-Vil is hosting a number of friends who lost their homes in his small apartment. \"What I can do, I will do it, but it's not easy because the situation is really complicated for everyone,\" he said. Cuba rides out the storm People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier. \"Life is what matters,\" Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. \"Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.\" Local media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground. \"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready,\" President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X. The hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which already has led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages. Cuba's National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Charco Redondo and 14 inches (36 centimeters) in Las Villas Reservoir. Wednesday night Melissa had top sustained winds of 90 mph (150 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 16 mph (26 kph) according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered about 65 miles (100 kilometers) east of the central Bahamas and about 860 miles (1,385 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda. Authorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival. Melissa's center is forecast to move through southeastern Bahamas later Wednesday, generating up to 7 feet (2 meters) of storm surge in the area. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-favela-deaths-f2e7366d98790c5c90e7996ec8b3282f","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:15.456Z","title":"Breakthrough in AI Language Models: New Model Achieves High-Quality, Ethical Text Generation","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leading AI research team has successfully deployed a new language model that significantly enhances the quality and relevance of generated text.

Dozens of favelas residents gathered in front of the state’s government headquarters shouting “assassins!” and waving Brazilian flags stained with red paint, a day after Rio’s deadliest raid and hours after families and residents laid dozens of dead bodies on a street in one of the targeted communities to show the magnitude of the operation. Questions quickly arose about the death count and the state of the bodies, with reports of disfigurement and knife wounds. Brazil’s Supreme Court, prosecutors and lawmakers asked Rio state Gov. Claudio Castro to provide detailed information about the operation. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “This was a massacre,” said Barbara Barbosa, a domestic worker from the Penha complex of favelas, one of the two huge communities targeted in the police operation.

They drew gunfire and other retaliation from gang members, sparking scenes of chaos across the city on Tuesday. Schools in the affected areas shuttered, a local university canceled classes, and roads were blocked with buses used as barricades.  Many shops remained closed Wednesday morning in Penha, where local activist Raull Santiago said he was part of a team that found about 15 bodies before dawn. “We saw executed people: shot in the back, shots to the head, stab wounds, people tied up. This level of brutality, the hatred that is spread - there’s no other way to describe it except as a massacre,” Santiago said. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Castro to provide information about the police operation and scheduled a hearing with the state governor and the heads of the military and civil police next Monday in Rio. The Senate’s commission for human rights said it was asking for clarifications from the Rio state government. Meanwhile, Rio prosecutors requested that Castro provide detailed information about the operation and proof that there was no less harmful means of achieving its objectives.  And the federal public prosecutor’s office asked the Forensic Medical Institute to ensure that autopsy reports contain full descriptions and photographic and radiographic documentation of all injuries. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Castro said on Tuesday that Rio was at war against “narco-terrorism,” a term that echoed the Trump administration  in its campaign against drug smuggling  in Latin America.  On Wednesday, Castro called the operation a “success,” apart from the deaths of the four police officers.  Rio’s state government said that the suspects who had been killed had resisted police. Rio has been the scene of lethal police raids for decades. In March 2005, some 29 people were killed in Rio’s Baixada Fluminense region, while in May 2021, 28 were killed in the Jacarezinho favela. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Residents surround the bodies of people killed the day before during a police raid targeting the Comando Vermelho gang in the Complexo da Penha favela of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

Human Rights Spokesperson Marta Hurtado said.  But Brazil must “break this cycle of extreme brutality and ensure that law enforcement operations comply with international standards regarding the use of force,” she said, adding that the body was calling for full-fledged policing reform. Late on Wednesday, President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  said on X that he had instructed the justice minister and director-general of Federal Police to meet Castro for a meeting in Rio.  Brazil cannot accept that organized crime “continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence across cities,” he said. The operation’s stated objectives were capturing leaders and limiting the territorial expansion of the Red Command gang, which has increased its control over favelas in recent years. Gang members allegedly targeted police with at least one drone. Rio de Janeiro’s state government shared a video on X of what appeared to show a drone firing a projectile from the sky. Gov. Castro, from the conservative opposition Liberal Party, said Tuesday that Rio was “alone in this war.” He said the federal government should be providing more support to combat crime — in a swipe at the administration of Lula’s leftist administration.

Criminal gangs have expanded their presence across Brazil in recent years,  including in the Amazon rainforest .  Roberto Uchôa, from the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety think-tank, said that criminal gangs have strengthened despite these kinds of operations, suggesting that they are inefficient. “Killing more than 100 people like this won’t help decrease the Red Command’s expansion. The dead will soon be replaced,” Uchôa said."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5588571","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"14:04:00-04:00","title":"The Fed cuts interest rates again as concerns grow about the job market","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point in October 2025, marking its second such cut in six weeks, as policymakers shift focus from inflation to concerns about a weakening job market.

Horsley \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 2:04 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point Wednesday, as policymakers work to shore up the softening job market.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It was the Fed's second rate cut in six weeks, after holding rates steady for much of the year in an effort to curb stubborn inflation.   Prices are still climbing faster than the central bank would like, but for now, policymakers are more concerned with preventing a big jump in unemployment.  A number of prominent corporations have announced job cuts in recent days.  Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate positions.  (Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR and pays to distribute some of our content.)  Target said last week it's cutting about 1000 corporate jobs and leaving another 800 jobs unfilled.  And the federal government cut about 100,000 jobs in the first eight months of the year, with many more workers expected to drop off the federal payroll in October.  Government shutdown clouds economic outlook The vote to cut interest rates by a quarter point was not unanimous.  The newest Fed governor, Stephen Miran, would have preferred a larger, half-point cut, while Jeffrey Schmid, who heads the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, would have preferred to leave rates unchanged.    The Fed's job has been complicated by the government shutdown, which has choked off much of the official data used to track the economy.  A report on September's job gains is  nearly a month overdue . And there's a question about whether October's job growth will be tallied at all.   The Labor Department did produce one official economic report last week, showing  inflation in September was slightly milder  than forecasters had expected.  That reinforced the idea that inflation concerns should take a backseat to worries about faltering job growth. \"My focus is on the labor market,\" Fed Governor Chris Waller said earlier this month.  \"Payroll gains have weakened this year and employment may well be shrinking already.\"  Waller says that while President Trump's tariffs are putting some upward pressure on prices, he does not expect long-lasting effects on inflation.   In the absence of official government data, analysts are looking to alternative tea leaves for signs of which way the economy is moving.  On Tuesday, the payroll processing company ADP reported a modest uptick in private-sector hiring during the four weeks ending in mid-October.  ADP's jobs numbers often differ, however, from the official government tallies.   \"We're seeing some improvement, but that improvement is tepid, and it is preliminary,\" said ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson.  \"As the weeks progress, we might see further weakness.\"   Weaker job market could weigh on spending  So long as workers are earning paychecks, they can continue to spend, but if job growth stalls and layoffs jump, that could become a drag on the broader economy.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The reason why consumers have been so resilient is the labor market has been relatively strong,\" Richardson says.  \"It's not glorious.  Some of the momentum that we saw early in the year has slowed down. But overall we are seeing enough strength to keep consumer spending steady.\"   Unemployment inched up over the summer, but there's been no official tally of the unemployment rate for September or October.   That's led Waller to rely more heavily on anecdotal reports from business contacts, which offers a mixed picture.  \"Employers indicate to me that there was some further softening in the labor market last month, while retailers report continued solid spending,\" Waller said.   Much of that spending may be driven by wealthy Americans who are less dependent on weekly paychecks, but a clearer picture will not be available until the government resumes releasing economic data. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates today for the second time in six weeks. It's a sign that worries about inflation are taking a backseat to concerns about the sagging job market, at least for now. NPR's Scott Horsley is with us now with a preview of today's Fed meeting. Good morning, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel. MARTIN: So, you know - so the Fed kept interest rates steady for most of this year. What's different now? HORSLEY: Well, the central bank is getting more concerned that the U.S. job market is losing steam. You know, we saw a slowdown in job growth over the summer. Employers actually cut jobs during the month of June. And then just in the last few days, we've had some prominent companies like Amazon announcing big layoffs. Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR and pays to distribute some of our content. They said yesterday they plan to cut 14,000 corporate jobs. Course, the federal government itself has also cut more than 100,000 jobs this year. A lot of federal workers were expected to come off the payroll in October. So given all that, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point at its last meeting in September, and forecasters think the Fed will order another quarter-point cut this afternoon. MARTIN: The Fed had been keeping interest rates relatively high to fight inflation. Do these cuts mean inflation is no longer a problem? HORSLEY: No. They just mean inflation's no longer the central bank's biggest problem. You know, prices are still going up faster than the Fed would like. And in recent months, inflation's actually been going up, not down, partly as a result of President Trump's tariffs. Fed Governor Chris Waller acknowledges those tariffs are pushing prices up when they take effect, but he said this month he doesn't think they will continue to drive inflation higher month after month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS WALLER: As a result, my focus is on the labor market, where payroll gains have weakened this year and employment may well be shrinking already. HORSLEY: Now, it's hard to know whether employers are adding fewer jobs because they don't need as many workers or because they can't find the workers they do need, perhaps because of the administration's crackdown on immigration. You know, one challenge is we are not getting the regular updates on the job market from the Labor Department that we normally would because of the government shutdown. MARTIN: You know, I was going to ask you about that. How much has that complicated the Fed's job? HORSLEY: Well, a good deal. You know, the Fed usually tries to steer a course that keeps employment as high as possible without letting prices get out of control. That is not easy in the best of times, and it's even harder if you're trying to drive with the windshield iced over and no headlights. In this case, the Fed does know what happened to prices in September. But because of the shutdown, it doesn't know really very well what happened in the job market. And if the shutdown drags on, we may not learn about prices for the month of October. Right now everybody is looking at alternative tea leaves to figure out which way the economy's going. For example, the payroll processing company ADP put out its own estimate of private sector job growth yesterday, based in part on the number of workers it's paying. That showed a modest uptick in hiring in recent weeks. But ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, says you got to take that with a big grain of salt. NELA RICHARDSON: We're seeing some improvement, but that improvement is tepid and it is preliminary. As the weeks progress, we might see further weakness. HORSLEY: So having that ADP data is better than nothing, but, you know, it's no substitute for the official government jobs tally. I'm sure the Fed would like to have more complete information as it approaches this interest rate vote this afternoon. But, you know, Fed policymakers don't have the option of just waiting around until the government shutdown is over to make their decision. They've just got to do the best they can. MARTIN: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thank you. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

held technology to allow South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine, President Donald Trump said on social media Thursday after  meeting with the country’s president . President Lee Jae Myung stressed to Trump  in their Wednesday meeting  that the goal was to modernize the alliance with the U.S., noting plans to increase military spending to reduce the financial burden on America.  The South Korean leader said there might have been a misunderstanding when they last spoke in August about nuclear-powered submarines, saying that his government was looking for nuclear fuel rather than weapons.  Lee said that South Korea’s current diesel-powered submarines have limits in tracking other countries’ submarine activities. If South Korea was equipped with nuclear-powered submarines, he said, it could help U.S. activities in the region. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Diesel-powered submarines have to surface regularly to recharge their batteries. But nuclear-powered submarines have superior endurance and can stay submerged for a significantly longer period. Trump said in a separate post that the country would build its nuclear-powered submarine in the Philly Shipyard, which was bought last year by South Korea’s Hanwha Group. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump no-show at big Asian economic forum may risk US reputation in region \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trade takeaways from Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 IOC and Saudi Arabia cancel their 12-year deal to host video gaming Esports Olympics in Riyadh \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n It was unclear what the size or cost of the sub project would be, but South Korea had said as part of talks with Trump that it had committed $150 billion to invest in  America’s shipbuilding capacity . \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n   \n      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.\n   \n   \n     Follow on \n     \n   \n \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n U.S. nuclear submarine technology is widely regarded as some of the most sensitive and highly guarded technology the military possesses.

God Can Judge Me' \n         By Destinee Adams, A Martínez \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 4:57 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Tupac Shakur wasn't always the cool, stylish and tough figure who came to define 1990s hip-hop. As a teenager, he was awkward and eccentric. He wore braces over his gapped, slightly brown teeth and walked like a duck, exhibiting a self-conscious swagger that made him stand out for all the wrong reasons. But even then, Shakur was magnetic and drew people in — a charm that, as writer Jeff Pearlman argues in his book  Only God Can Judge Me: The Many Lives of Tupac Shakur,  helps explain the contradictions that shaped Shakur's short, extraordinary life. \"When people give too much grandeur to his thoughts and his behavior, both negative and positive, actually, I would say you have to remember, he was a baby, like he was a baby,\" Pearlman said. Shakur was 19 years old when he began working on his debut album,  2Pacalypse Now , and only 25 when he was shot and killed. \"He didn't know what he was doing. He was trying his best,\" Pearlman said. A longtime sportswriter and  New York Times  bestselling author, Pearlman has chronicled baseball legends, football stars and unforgettable seasons in the sports industry. But he wanted to try something new. Pearlman interviewed over 600 people for his latest book, including Tupac's high school girlfriend, who shared more than 100 love letters Shakur had written to her, crack dealers in Marin City, Calif., who informed his sound and perspective, and the baby who inspired one of his most memorable songs, \"Brenda's Got A Baby.\"  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       What Pearlman found through these conversations and extensive research was a man of \"yin and yang,\" a person of constant dualities: sensitive yet hard-edged, sexualized but inexperienced on the subject of intimacy, and a devoted son who struggled to watch his mother develop a crack addiction. Pearlman spoke to NPR's A Martínez about Shakur's personal life, from birth to his early 20s, and how it shaped his incomparable career and led to his devastating early death. Here are three takeaways from the conversation. Tupac's mother was a hero but not a mom The book begins with a 21-year-old Afeni Shakur attending the 1970 Panther 21 trial, where several members of the Black Panther Party in New York were accused of shooting at police officers and attempting to destroy police stations. Afeni, then pregnant with Tupac, turned down a court appointed attorney, because she didn't think the attorney was loud enough. With little money and a high school education, she represented herself — and won. \"I feel like we should have been, for years, learning about her in the history books in American history classes,\" Pearlman said. Tupac was proud to call Afeni his mother. He bragged about her role as a Black Panther and held on tightly to her early lessons of strength and Black pride. But their relationship grew complicated as she fell into a serious drug addiction. \"So, you have this guy who worships his mother and tells everyone he meets, 'Oh, my mom was a Black Panther. My mom, Panther 21, my mom represented herself.' And then at the same time has the sadness and the heartbreak of watching her fall into a state of what seemed to be disrepair,\" Pearlman said. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Later in his music career, Tupac released a song — a classic in the hip-hop world — titled \"Dear Mama,\" which describes a single mother struggling to raise two children on welfare. In the song, Tupac is candid about his mother's crack addiction, but he intertwines difficult lyrics with direct affirmations to his mother, repeating things like, \"You are appreciated.\" Pearlman found the song was more aspirational than autobiographical. \"He had a hero, but he didn't have a mother,\" Pearlman said. A sex symbol who didn't understand sex By the time he became a famed rapper and a working movie star, he was widely seen as an American sex symbol. But Pearlman found that image was not rooted in reality. In fact, he says, Tupac \"didn't understand sex\" — at all. \"He was 14 years old when he had his first sexual experience, and it was with a cousin,\" Pearlman said. \"Then when he was 15 years old. He had his second sexual experience and it was with a friend of his mother, an adult friend of his mother.\" With no father and little guidance, Tupac grew up not understanding intimacy and how to sustain emotional connections, especially with romantic partners, according to Pearlman. Tupac lost a rap battle — it ignited his career Raised in New York City and later Baltimore, Tupac attended Baltimore School for the Arts, where he wrote love letters and poetry and participated in theater. But, before his senior year of high school, his mother moved the family across the country to Marin City, Calif., where his music career developed and soared. At 17, kicked out of his mother's house, Shakur moved in with DJ Shaboo, Demetrius Striplin, who supported Tupac and introduced him to the local hip-hop scene. Tupac jumped in showing off his writing and storytelling skills, and, eventually, he started battle rapping other musicians in the city. \"One day Tupac does a rap battle in Marin City in front of a bunch of people, and there's a 13-year-old rapper named Tac. And Tac just demolishes him. And Tupac is devastated,\" Pearlman said. Tupac disappeared for several days after the battle. During his short-lived hiatus, he shadowed a local gangster for inspiration. Tupac studied how he walked, talked and thought, and when he returned to Striplin's house, he wrote \"Days of a Criminal,\" a song about life as a California gang banger. \"The song is awesome,\" Pearlman said. \"And that was Tupac getting his butt kicked and realizing, 'I can't just rap about my thoughts. I have to rap about what I see and what is going on around me.' And that was the moment, sort of a really key moment, for Tupac.\" In that moment, Tupac had found the formula for his music and discovered the persona that he wanted to embody.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Like many moments in the late rapper's life, he overcame hardship or devastation and turned it into gold. The start of Tupac's career was defined by the same tension Pearlman traces throughout his book: the artist and the fighter, the proud kid yearning for his mother, and the young man the world turned into a mogul and, ultimately, a myth. The audio story was produced by Kaity Kline and edited by Lindsay Totty. The digital version was edited by Majd Al-Waheidi. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Tupac Shakur was one of the most influential pop culture figures of the '90s. His rap lyrics echoed the voices of disaffected Black youth, and in some songs, he sought to lift his community out of that anguish. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"KEEP YA HEAD UP\") 2PAC: (Rapping) Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me. He had me feeling like Black was the thing to be. And suddenly, the ghetto didn't seem so tough. And though we had it rough, we always had enough. MARTÍNEZ: But Tupac Shakur's life ended in tragedy when he was just 25 years old. Writer Jeff Pearlman wanted to know more about those 25 years, so he interviewed hundreds of people for a new book called \"Only God Can Judge Me: The Many Lives Of Tupac Shakur.\" When I sat down with Pearlman, I asked about the incredible story of Tupac' mother, Afeni Shakur, who inspired the song \"Dear Mama.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEAR MAMA\") 2PAC: (Rapping) 'Cause when I was low, you was there for me, and never left me alone, because you cared for me. And I can see you coming home after work late. You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate. MARTÍNEZ: So, Jeff, who was Afeni Shakur? And what was it like for Tupac to be raised by her? JEFF PEARLMAN: Afeni Shakur was a Black Panther. When she was 21 years old, she was pregnant with Tupac. She was being shuttled from jail to a courthouse in Manhattan for something called the Panther 21 trial, which was that the government had infiltrated the Panthers and accused 21 members of the Black Panthers of trying to blow up different landmarks. And she was one of the people on trial. She turned down a court appointed attorney, represented herself and won while pregnant with Tupac. And later in her life, but not that much later, develops into a very, very, very serious crack addict, who isn't there for her kids. So you have this guy who worships his mother and tells everyone he meets, oh, my mom was a Black Panther. In Panther 21, my mom represented herself. And then at the same time has the sadness and the heartbreak of watching her fall into a state of disrepair. And there's this one moment when Tupac was 19 years old. He was supposed to fly to Atlanta. And a group he was hoping to help sent him $300 in cash to buy the plane ticket. And when he gets home, the money is gone, and his mother had used it to buy crack. And a friend of his named Kendrick Wells, who I interviewed, said the mom he wanted wasn't the mother he had. He had a hero, but he didn't have a mother. MARTÍNEZ: So what you said right there, he had a hero, but he didn't have a mother. I'm wondering how that thought maybe extends toward his relationship with women over the years, because he had a complicated one. PEARLMAN: Oh, man, it's heartbreaking. He was 14 years old when he had his first sexual experience, and it was with a cousin. When he was 15 years old, he had a second sexual experience, and it was with an adult friend of his mother. He had no father around. His dad, Billy Garland, was not around for the vast majority of his life. He never learned about sex, never learned about how to treat people in that way and then became this guy known as a sex symbol. But throughout his youth, throughout middle school, much of high school, he was a kid with gapped teeth, really bad braces. He walked like a duck. He wore thrift store clothes. He was not a guy the women were interested in. And his whole life was kind of a yin and yang of being a sex symbol, being an ugly duckling, being a guy who didn't understand sex, being a guy who dove into sex. MARTÍNEZ: So in 1995, Tupac was in prison for sexual abuse. And he began to form a partnership with Suge Knight, who founded Death Row Records. Knight posted a $1.4 million bond before he signed Tupac to Death Row. And then the next year, they released \"All Eyez On Me,\" his most successful commercial album and his last before he was shot to death. And it included arguably his biggest hit, \"California Love.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CALIFORNIA LOVE\") 2PAC: (Rapping) Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming. Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming. Fiending for money and alcohol, the life of a West Side player where cowards die and the strong ball. MARTÍNEZ: Jeff, it always felt to me that, even back then, Tupac in a way sold his soul during this time in his life. What did he see in Suge Knight that others maybe didn't? Because Suge Knight is a scary guy. He's in prison right now serving a 28-year sentence for a hit-and-run, a fatal hit-and-run. But what did he see in Suge Knight that others couldn't? PEARLMAN: It's interesting. Tupac is in prison at Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York. And as he's there, Suge Knight is greasing the wheels. He is sending his mother money. He's sending his mother gifts. He visits Tupac multiple times, and he basically shows up one day and provides the bail. And for Tupac that was liberation. And the other thing is that Suge Knight actually supplied is amazing musical opportunities. He hired the best producers. But he also had expectations. Suge Knight's line for writers was, write a hit or get hit. I interviewed one guy who was hired. And as soon as he was hired, he said Suge Knight walked him over to a window and said, just so you know, we don't take failed employees and fire them. We take failed employees and throw them out windows. And Suge Knight expected Tupac to exemplify sort of thug life. And he sold Tupac on this lifestyle. And Tupac really wasn't that, but he kind of bought into. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, because that album, as good as it was, it was not what he was doing before. Before, it was a little more socially conscious. This was all about, as you say, this thug life that Suge Knight wanted him to kind of put out there. Now, he died in Las Vegas in September of 1996. As someone who has chronicled Tupac Shakur's whole life, all the accomplishments, all the pain, everything he's endured, all the mistakes he's made, what do you think about how his life ended? PEARLMAN: It sucks. It's the worst death I've ever written about or really even read about in regards to the pointlessness of it. They're in Las Vegas. It was the aftermath, immediate aftermath, of the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon fight at the MGM Grand. Tupac is walking through the lobby. He's with a bunch of Death Row guys. Standing there in the middle of the lobby is a guy named Orlando Anderson, who is a South Side Compton Crip. And a guy with Tupac says, yeah, that's the guy who stole my chain. Tupac walks up to him, says - you from the south? - and then punches him in the face. And all the Death Row guys come in and stomp on him and beat him up. Then they leave. Later that night, Orlando Anderson, Keefe D's, his uncle, two other guys driving around kind of looking for Tupac. There he is at one point along the strip, dangling out of Suge Knight's car hollering at women, and he shot him. And it's so stupid. Tupac had so many gifts and was so talented and had so much to contribute. His mom was a Black Panther. He was raised on this idea about raising up Black people as a community in this country and fighting for them, and this is how you die. And one of his friends said to me, if you really want to understand Tupac, his life and his death, you have to understand the idea that he swam in waters too deep. And I feel like that was a perfect example of a guy who wasn't a gang banger swimming in waters that were way too deep for him. MARTÍNEZ: That's Jeff Pearlman, author of \"Only God Can Judge Me: The Many Lives Of Tupac Shakur.\" Jeff, thanks a lot. PEARLMAN: Oh, thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHANGES\") 2PAC: (Rapping) I see no changes. All I see is racist faces. MARTÍNEZ: And we should mention that Orlando Anderson, who is now deceased, consistently denied his involvement in Tupac's murder. And he was never tried. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/google-alphabet-earnings-artificial-intelligence-7a36361f293b828d30607e8c6dea982c","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:37:24+00:00","title":"Alphabet Reports First Quarter with Over $100 Billion in Revenue Amid Legal Challenges","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, reported its first quarter with over $100 billion in revenue, achieving a 33% year-over-year profit increase to nearly $35 billion.

billion in revenue, a milestone that illustrates the unwavering power of its internet empire amid legal and competitive threats. The news of Alphabet Inc.’s accelerating growth in revenue and profit comes on the heels of a court ruling in the U.S. Justice Department’s landmark monopoly case against Google’s dominant search engine that was widely seen  as a mild rebuke  that wouldn’t hobble the company. Alphabet performed like a powerhouse during the July-September period, delivering a profit of nearly $35 billion, or $2.87 per share, a 33% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% from last year to $102.3 billion. Both figures easily exceeded the analysts’ projections that steer the stock market. Investors celebrated the third-quarter numbers by driving up Alphabet’s stock price more than 6% in Wednesday’s extended trading, setting the stage for the shares to reach a new high during Thursday’s regular trading session. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The gains supplement a 30% surge in Alphabet’s shares that has created nearly $770 billion in stockholder wealth since early September.

In a sign of the inroads those efforts are making, Alphabet  CEO Sundar Pichai disclosed  Wednesday that Google’s AI-powered Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users. “We are seeing AI drive real business results across the company,” Pichai told analysts during a Wednesday conference call in which he described Google being in “an expansionary moment.” Like other major tech companies, Google has been bankrolling its AI ambitions with a spending spree that has raised worries about a  potential bubble that will eventually burst . Alphabet now expects to budget $91 billion to $93 billion for capital expenditures this year,  up from $85 billion in its previous quarterly report issued in July , with most of the money earmarked for the massive data centers needed to power AI. Alphabet’s chief financial officer, Anat Ashkenazi, told analysts to expect a significant increase in the company’s capital expenditures next year and said more specifics will be provided in early 2026. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “In a world where AI-driven search volumes are steadily taking market share and reshaping Alphabet’s legacy business, this report makes it clear the company isn’t ready to give up its lead anytime soon,” said Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro. Alphabet has the luxury of drawing upon a lucrative ad network that Google has spent a quarter century building. Google’s ad sales totaled $74.2 billion in the third quarter, a 13% increase from last year. The AI craze has been a boon for Google’s Cloud division that oversees data centers for other companies, an endeavor that has turned into the fastest growing part of Alphabet. Google Cloud posted revenue of $15.2 billion in the past quarter, up 34% from last year. Although Google appears to have fared relatively well in the legal attack on its search engine, it still faces a potentially damaging blow in another case brought by the Justice Department against the technology underlying its ad network. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n After condemning  parts of Google’s ad technology as an illegal monopoly  earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema is considering ways  to handcuff the company in the future.  The Justice Department is seeking a court order to force Google to sell pieces of its ad network — an issue that Brinkema isn’t expected to rule on until early next year."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-cuomo-1fb8cd6abb16249a2bd83ccf10c5bbf5","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"14:57:45+00:00","title":"Andrew Cuomo Faces Backlash Over Islamophobic Campaign Tactics in NYC Mayoral Race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 1977, Mario Cuomo publicly opposed anti-gay political attacks during the New York City mayoral race, warning that such tactics would scar the city’s reputation.

Almost 50 years later, his son is taking a different approach. Back then,  Andrew Cuomo  was a 19-year-old adviser to his father, who would later become the state’s governor but at the time was losing the mayor’s race against the Democratic nominee, Ed Koch. A few weeks before the election, posters appeared in some neighborhoods referencing Koch’s long-rumored sexuality with the slogan: “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.” This time around, it’s Andrew Cuomo’s backers disparaging Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani , who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor, as  an Islamic extremist . But Cuomo has done little to discourage them, drawing allegations that his campaign is embracing Islamophobia, or is at least willing to capitalize on it. \n     \n         \n     \n

mirroring the  recent growth of Muslim voters  as an electoral force. “In both cases,” Soyer said, “the emergence of these constituencies brought backlash from people trying to paint them as illegitimate participants in mainstream politics.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let

Asked about the comparison, Cuomo argued that it was Mamdani, not him, who had leveraged  criticism of Israel  as a wedge issue in the campaign.  “My father was saying don’t raise gay as an issue. There’s no place, don’t divide people, don’t play that kind of politics,” he said. “And to me that is a mirror to what Zohran’s doing, exactly.” “You don’t want to create wedges and division,” Cuomo continued. “And there is no one associated with me, standing next to me who’s ever done anything like that.”  Many  in his own party  — including some  centrist Democrats  — disagree, pointing to a barrage of attacks both online and in person that Cuomo has largely avoided denouncing. Appearing on a conservative radio show last week, Cuomo chuckled at host Sid Rosenberg’s suggestion that Mamdani would be “cheering” on another 9/11 attack. “That’s another problem,” Cuomo replied. At an  endorsement event , he nodded along as Mayor Eric Adams implied that a Mamdani victory could make Islamic terrorism more likely in the city. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A  new ad  funded by a Cuomo-supporting super PAC places the words “Jihad On NYC” over Mamdani’s smiling face — a reference to a headline about a controversial religious leader who has appeared in photos beside Mamdani and other politicians,  including Adams . Cuomo’s official campaign account, meanwhile, recently shared — and then deleted — an AI-generated video depicting Mamdani eating rice with his hands, something critics have used to mock his South Asian heritage. A spokesperson for Cuomo said the video was posted in error. Mamdani sees the attacks as part of a familiar playbook. “To be Muslim in New York is to expect indignity,” he said Friday. “But indignity does not make us distinct. There are many New Yorkers who face it. It is the tolerance of that indignity that does.” In response, Cuomo said his opponent’s  views toward Israel , including allegations that it committed genocide in Gaza, had “created real fear in Jewish communities.” He acknowledged that Rosenberg’s comment was “offensive,” but maintained that “nobody is attacking (Mamdani) for being Muslim.”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n His own staunch support for Israel, Cuomo said, might be compared to his father’s vocal opposition to the death penalty — another issue outside of a mayor’s control, but which nonetheless animated the 1977 race amid growing fears of crime and disorder.  “Eighty percent of New Yorkers supported the death penalty and he wouldn’t change his position,” Cuomo noted. “I’ve supported Israel all my life. I get the political consequence.”  ‘If Mario Cuomo were here today...’ To this day, the exact origin of the posters remains a matter of dispute. Koch would  go to his grave blaming  Mario and Andrew Cuomo, though both have denied involvement. “Nobody ever accused my father’s associates of having anything to do with that,” Cuomo said by phone recently. Shortly before the election, Mario Cuomo’s campaign manager  admitted to a Village Voice reporter  that he had investigated rumors of Koch’s homosexuality. Mario Cuomo received the news with horror. “Oh Christ,” he told the reporter. “Holy mother of god. I’m so...I’m so...disappointed.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The outrage over the signs extended to some of Koch’s opponents, recalled Allen Roskoff, who chaired Lesbians and Gays for Mario Cuomo in the 1977 race, noting that his boss may have been “motivated by political expediency as much as his own conviction.” “The big difference now is that there doesn’t seem to be anyone in the pro-Cuomo camp that is taking umbrage to this anti-Muslim demagoguery, which is effectively condoning it,” said Roskoff, who now chairs the influential Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club and plans to vote for Mamdani. “If Mario Cuomo were here today,” Roskoff added, “he would be holding a press conference saying this is wrong and it’s not what a campaign should be about.”"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95719","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:41:00-04:00","title":"Toronto Blue Jays take a 3-2 lead over Los Angeles Dodgers in World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Toronto Blue Jays extended their lead to 3-2 over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the 2025 World Series, fueled by a strong performance from rookie pitcher Trey Yesavage, who recorded 12 strikeouts — a World Series rookie record — and remained unbeaten in five postseason appearances.

Toronto Blue Jays take a 3-2 lead over Los Angeles Dodgers in World Series \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:41 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LOS ANGELES — Trey Yesavage set a World Series rookie record with 12 strikeouts, and the Toronto Blue Jays opened Game 5 with back-to-back homers in a 6-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday that moved them within one win of their first championship since 1993. Davis Schneider and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. connected on Blake Snell's first and third pitches, the first consecutive home runs to start a Series game. Yesavage, a precocious 22-year-old right-hander who began his season last April pitching before 327 fans in Class A, took over from there. With a sinking splitter, spinning slider and overpowering fastball that quieted LA bats and a crowd of 52,175, he broke the prior Series rookie record of 11 strikeouts set by Don Newcombe for the Dodgers in a 1-0 loss to the New York Yankees in the 1949 opener. Getting six Ks each with his splitter and slider, Yesavage became the first World Series pitcher with 12 strikeouts and no walks. \"I'm kind of blown away by what he did,\" Toronto manager John Schneider said. After losing a Game 3 heartbreaker in 18 innings Monday night, the resilient Blue Jays bounced right back with two comfortable wins. Toronto leads 3-2 in the best-of-seven matchup and can dethrone the defending champions back home when the Series resumes Friday night at Rogers Centre. No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000. \"We've got to kind of wipe the slate clean and find a way to win Game 6 and pick up the pieces and see where we're at,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. Yesavage allowed three hits over seven innings and his only run when Kiké Hernández homered on a high fastball to trim the Dodgers' deficit to 2-1 in the third. Seranthony Domínguez and Jeff Hoffman finished a four-hitter. \"When three of my pitches are in the strike zone, or even two, like part of tonight, I mean, I'm in control,\" Yesavage said. \"Just stay in the strike zone and get ahead.\" Yesavage debuted with the Blue Jays on Sept. 15, his fifth level of baseball this year. He went 1-0 in three regular-season starts and is 3-1 in five postseason outings. Yesavage induced 23 swings and misses — most in a Series game since pitch tracking started in 2008, one more than San Francisco's Tim Lincecum in 2010 Game 5. \"Obviously the stuff is incredible, but the maturity to go and handle these moments is unbelievable. It was a special thing to watch today,\" teammate Bo Bichette said. \"I think he's ultra confident, but you never hear it in the clubhouse, which I think says something about him. He comes here to work and try to help us win. I can't say enough good things about his performance.\" Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, dropped to 0-2 in the Series, allowing five runs, six hits and four walks over 6 2/3 innings. Roberts shook up his slumping batting order, dropping Mookie Betts as low as third for the first time since 2021 and benching outfielder Andy Pages in favor of Alex Call. It didn't spark an offense that is hitting .202 in the Series and has solo shots on seven of its eight home runs. Los Angeles has scored just four runs in its last 29 innings. The Dodgers also threw four wild pitches in a span of two innings. \"We've got to make some adjustments,\" Roberts said. \"We've been in elimination games, a core group of these guys, and we've got to find a way to win a game. That's it.\" Davis Schneider, batting first only because regular leadoff hitter George Springer got hurt in Game 3, sent Snell's first pitch into the left-field bleachers. Guerrero hit the third into the Dodgers' bullpen for his eighth home run of the postseason. Davis Schneider mimics different stances during the year, including Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Bobby Witt Jr. and even the Dodgers' Will Smith during the World Series. The part-time outfielder and second baseman was in an old stance of his from the minor leagues against Snell. Snell started with three fastballs, then avoided another one for 22 consecutive pitches before striking out Andres Giménez with a heater to end the second. Ernie Clement added a fourth-inning sacrifice fly for a 3-1 lead after right fielder Teoscar Hernández came up short on a sliding catch attempt as Daulton Varsho's drive bounced into the right-field corner for a leadoff triple. Another run scored on a wild pitch in the seventh by Edgardo Henriquez, who then allowed Bichette's RBI single. Isiah Kiner-Falefa added a run-scoring single in the eighth off Anthony Banda. \"I think we just want to be the toughest outs we can possibly be,\" Bichette said. \"We're a team, man, and we'll do anything we can to win.\" Up next Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Toronto RHP Kevin Gausman start Game 6 in a rematch of Game 2, which Los Angeles won 5-1. Yamamoto pitched a four-hitter for the first World Series complete game since 2015 and has pitched the first consecutive postseason complete games since Curt Schilling had three in a row in 2001. Gausman allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/layoffs-2025-amazon-ups-job-cuts-8413af9ac5b434b092ed76d6fa6cd196","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"19:45:49+00:00","title":"Widespread Corporate Layoffs and Job Market Instability in 2025 Amid AI and Tariff Pressures","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of corporate layoffs and hiring freezes is reshaping the global job market in early 2025.

2025-10-28T19:45:49+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time for the  job market . Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many  to limit new work  to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, some sizeable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new  tariffs  and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names  like Amazon , are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were  cut by the thousands . And many workers are now going  without pay  as the U.S.  government shutdown  nears its fourth week. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “A lot of people are looking around, scanning the job environment, scanning the opportunities that are available to them — whether it’s in the public or private sector,” said Jason Schloetzer, professor business administration at Georgetown University’s McDonough School. “And I think there’s a question mark around the long-term stability everywhere.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 GM lays off 1,700 workers at plants in Michigan and Ohio amid slower EV demand \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Paramount to lay off 2,000 employees shortly after its merger with Skydance \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Judge extends order barring the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the shutdown \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Government  hiring data  is on hold during the shutdown, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed that the private sector  lost 32,000 jobs  in September.

Hundreds of additional employees are  reportedly  slated for “temporary layoffs.” And GM has recently moved to downsize other parts of its workforce, too — including 200 layoffs mostly impacting engineers in Detroit, and other 300 job cuts at a Georgia IT Innovation Center, which it is also shuttering. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Paramount In long-awaited cuts just months after completing  its $8 billion merger with Skydance , Paramount is going to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated  roughly 1,000 of those layoffs  on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter,  who spoke  on the condition of anonymity. The rest of the cuts will be made at a later date.

A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. CEO Andy Jassy previously said he anticipated generative AI  would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce  in the coming years. And he has worked to aggressively cut costs overall since 2021.  UPS United Parcel Service  has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts  this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs.  In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said it’s cut about 34,000 operational positions — and the company announced another 14,000 role reductions, mostly within management. Combined, that’s much higher  than the roughly 20,000 cuts  UPS forecast earlier this year. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Target Last week, Target that it would  eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions , or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. Target said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts — with Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke noting that “too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions.” The retailer is also looking to  rebuild its customer base . Target reported flat or declining comparable sales in nine of the past eleven quarters. Nestlé In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be  cutting 16,000 jobs globally  — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. The cuts arrive as Nestlé and others face headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed  tariffs . The company announced price hikes over the summer to offset higher coffee and cocoa costs. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Lufthansa Group In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of  artificial intelligence , digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Most of the lost jobs would be  in Germany , and the focus would be on administrative rather than operational roles, the company said. The layoff plans arrived even as the company reported strong demand for air travel and predicted stronger profits in years ahead. Novo Nordisk Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk  said it would cut 9,000 jobs , about 11% of its workforce.  Novo Nordisk — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring as the company works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n ConocoPhillips Oil giant ConocoPhillips has said it plans to  lay off up to a quarter of its workforce , as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. A spokesperson for ConocoPhillips confirmed the layoffs on Sept. 3, noting that 20% to 25% of the company’s employees and contractors would be impacted worldwide. At the time, ConocoPhillips had a total headcount of about 13,000 — or between 2,600 and 3,250 workers. Most reductions were expected to take place before the end of 2025. Intel Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business as it lags behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. In a July memo to employees, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to  end the year with 75,000 “core” workers , excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a  15% workforce reduction . Microsoft In May, Microsoft began  began laying off about 6,000 workers  across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be  cutting 9,000 positions  — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The latest job cuts hit Microsoft’s Xbox video game business and other divisions. The company has cited “organizational changes,” with many executives characterizing the layoffs as part of a push to trim management layers. But the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. Procter & Gamble In June, Procter & Gamble said it would  cut up to 7,000 jobs  over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. In July, P&G said it would hike prices  on about a quarter of its products  due to the newly-imposed import taxes, although it’s since said it  expects to take less of a hit  than previously anticipated for the 2026 fiscal year."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cempasuchil-mexico-marigol-day-of-dead-climate-997b90e2e827ad543992ec8507837b6e","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:05:37+00:00","title":"Mexican Marigold Farmers Face Climate Crisis Amid Day of the Dead Traditions","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Mexico, farmers like Lucia Ortíz in Xochimilco are facing devastating losses in their cempasuchil (marigold) crops due to extreme weather events linked to climate change.

2025-10-30T05:05:37+00:00\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — Lucia Ortíz trudges through endless fields of cempasuchil flowers, the luminescent orange petals of which will soon cloak everything from city streets to cemeteries across Mexico. Here, in the winding canals and farms on the fringes of Mexico City, the flower also known as the Mexican marigold has been farmed for generations, and takes the spotlight every year in the country’s Day of the Dead celebrations. But as 50-year-old Ortíz and other farmers busily bundle clusters of the plant to sell in markets around the capital, they quietly wonder what will be left of their livelihood down the line. That’s because cempasuchil growers say they’ve been left reeling by torrential rains, stretching drought and other  impacts from climate change  — caused by the burning of fuels like gas, oil and coal – that have grown increasingly common. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Farmers, who depend on the ebbs and flows of the weather to cultivate their crops, are on the  front line on the climate crisis . This year alone, cempasuchil producers said they lost up to half their flower crop from heavy rains and flooding. “This year, we lost a lot. We struggled to even grow the cempasuchil. There were moments in which we didn’t have the money to buy fertilizer we needed,” Ortíz said. “With the cempasuchil plants, we’ve sometimes been left with nothing.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n ‘Flower of the dead’ The orange flower has become a symbol of the country’s celebrations that take place every Nov. 1 and 2. Also known as the “flower of the dead”, the cempasuchil is believed to be a point of connection between the worlds of the dead and the living, with bright petals that light the path of dead souls to the altars set out by their family. The flowers are also a crucial economic engine across Mexico, which commerce groups predict will rake in nearly 2.7 million dollars for farmers in 2025. Ortíz and her family began growing the flower 30 years ago in their small plot of land in Xochimilco, a rural borough in the south of Mexico City where residents have continued to carry on ancient farming techniques using canals that wind through farmlands like a maze.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Every year, locals begin to plant the marigold seeds in July, and grow the plants as rainy season winds down. But they say that they’ve been dealt a heavy blow for consecutive years as heavy rains, drought, floods and other climate shifts have made it increasingly difficult to keep their crops alive. This year, torrential rains stretching on for months wiped out more than 37,000 acres of crops across the country, according to government figures. In a visit to cempasuchil fields earlier this month in Xochimilco, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said that as many of 2 million marigold plants were put at risk. Despite that, she said that production this year simultaneously broke a record of 6 million plants as farmers ramp up to meet increasing demand even as growing the flower has become more precarious. Ortíz said the excess of rain has brought on pests, diseases and rotted the roots of her plants. She estimates she lost at least 30% of her crop, while others say they’ve lost closer to 50%.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The family has been forced to drop money on insecticides, fertilizer and more to save their crops. As they have, razor thin profit margins have turned into losses, and they’ve had to cut back on basics like beef and sweets to make ends meet. “If I were to take a hard look at all our losses, I’d be incredibly disillusioned and even not want to grow them anymore,” she said. “We’re just trying to push forward and make sure this keeps going on.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Adapting to climate change Just down the road from Ortíz’s farm, government scientists are searching for long-term solutions beyond the short-term economic relief provided by the local government. In a small seed bank known as Toxinachcal, men in white suits meticulously pick through sprouts in a lab dish.  The scientists have been at work for a year and a half saving up thousands of seed variants of native plant species, including 20 variants of cempasuchil, in jars lining giant freezers in the hopes that the storage facility will be a key tool in fighting the most averse effects of climate change. Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank, said part of the reason that the crop has been devastated is because farmers in recent years have elected to use a hybrid marigold seed variant from the United States.  The seed produces a shorter more uniform-looking plant that are easier to sell en-masse and in places like supermarkets.  But that means farmers have turned away from sturdier, native breeds, which have a longer stocks and widely vary in color, size and texture. The genetic diversity of these Mexican breeds makes them more resilient to drastic climate shifts like the ones seen this year, Soto said.  “These native seeds have adapted to different geographies, in high altitudes and low, in places where there’s a lot of rain or there’s none at all, or where they need to be resistant to insects,” she said.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The (hybrid) seeds have bred for another purpose. It doesn’t have the genetic diversity needed to take on climate change.” If more climate events, like the floods that roiled producers wipe out an entire crop, Soto said the bank will make seeds available to local producers to recover their crops – this time with a more resilient variant that their ancestors have been farming for centuries. Carrying on an ancient tradition Meanwhile, growers are scrambling to bounce back in the short term, saying the losses also represent a threat to the farming tradition their families have struggled to maintain on the edge of the dense city of 23 million people. Carlos Jiménez, 61, has long worked the fields of Xochimilco, but began to grow the shorter marigold plants eight years ago when he noticed the hybrid was more marketable. As he’s lost more crops and gotten lower prices for the plants because of the mildew gathering at their roots, he said he’s begun considering ways to adapt, like building greenhouses. “The plants get sick, they rot, and our business is snuffed out,” Jiménez said. “And with it goes our tradition because it’s our economy.” Producers like Ortíz have considered the same. But their losses mean they have no money to build added infrastructure. Her family and other farmers have called on local authorities for help, but say they’ve received just pennies on the dollar of what they need to bounce back. Though the local government has said it continues to work to help offset the blow felt by farmers. She said she’s begun to look at other crops she might be able to farm that are more resilient than the crinkled orange flowers. Others like Jiménez said that while the roots of plants may rot around him, for now he’s holding strong. “This plant has a deeper meaning to our lost loved ones,” he said. “These are traditions we carry down from our ancestors. They can’t just disappear.” ___ Read more of  AP’s climate coverage . ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.  Massey’s father, James Wilburn, called for the Illinois measure to become law nationally, along with stalled federal police misconduct and civil rights legislation. “There’s a difference in this country when you have my skin color and Grayson’s skin color,” Wilburn said. “We need serious justice, not a miscarriage of justice.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n   \n      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.\n   \n   \n     Follow on \n     \n   \n \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Grayson, who is white, and another deputy arrived at Massey’s home in Springfield early on July 6, 2024, after she reported hearing someone banging on the outside of her house.

Defense attorney Daniel Fultz declined to comment after the verdict. Officer testified in his own defense Body camera video  recorded by another Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy at the scene, Dawson Farley, was a key part of the prosecution’s case. It showed Massey, who struggled with mental health issues, telling the officers, “Don’t hurt me,” and repeating, “Please God.”  When the deputies entered the house, Grayson saw the pot on the stove and ordered Farley to move it. Massey jumped up to retrieve the pot, and she and Grayson joked about how he said he was backing off from the “hot, steaming water.” Massey then replied, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Grayson immediately warned her that he would shoot her in the face. He and Farley drew their pistols and yelled at Massey to put the pot down. Grayson, who testified in his own defense, told investigators he thought her  “rebuke” meant she intended to kill him  and, in the following commotion, fired three shots, striking Massey just below the eye.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     In this image taken from body camera video released by Illinois State Police, Sonya Massey, left, talks with former Sangamon County Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson outside her home in Springfield, Ill., July 6, 2024.

Despite family members’ anger, Antonio Romanucci, one of the lawyers who helped Massey’s relatives win a  $10 million  settlement from Sangamon County, said, “Make no mistake: Sean Grayson is convicted of murder. He is a murderer now.” Farley testified that Massey didn’t say or do anything that  caused him to view her as a threat . But under cross-examination, he acknowledged that he initially reported to investigators that he feared for his safety because of the hot water. Farley did not fire his weapon and was not charged.  Massey’s death forced the early retirement of the sheriff who hired Grayson and generated a  U.S. Justice Department inquiry  that was settled when the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department’s agreed to bolster de-escalation training, work with mental health professionals when necessary and generate data on use-of-force incidents."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-melissa-cuba-jamaica-flooding-winds-275a4d2d41a0ff3f382053865eefe295","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"05:29:16+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa Leaves Dozens Dead and Causes Widespread Destruction Across Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, made landfall as a Category 5 storm in Jamaica with winds of 185 mph, causing catastrophic damage across Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica.

Jamaica, where roofless homes, toppled utility poles and water-logged furniture dominated the landscape Wednesday. A landslide blocked the main roads of Santa Cruz in Jamaica’s St. Elizabeth parish, where the streets were reduced to mud pits. Residents swept water from homes as they tried to salvage belongings. Wind ripped off part of the roof at a high school that serves as a public shelter. \n     \n         \n                \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n\n    \n \n\n                 \n                \n                 \n                     Hurricane Melissa is grinding across eastern Cuba as a Category 3 storm after pummeling Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record.

Dixon said 77% of the island was without power. The outages complicated assessing the damage because of “a total communication blackout” in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station. “Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement. “Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.” Officials in Black River, Jamaica, a southwestern coastal town of approximately 5,000 people, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday. “Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,” Mayor Richard Solomon said. Solomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm.

St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto told Nationwide News Network on Wednesday that authorities have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica. One death was reported in the west when a tree fell on a baby, state minister Abka Fitz-Henley told Nationwide News Network.

People screamed as they searched for their missing children, he said. “People have lost everything,” Saint-Vil said. Although the immediate threat of the storm has passed, Saint-Vil said Petit-Goâve’s residents were living in fear about access to medicine, water and food in the coming days given the  political instability in Haiti . “We don’t know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n For now, neighbors are helping one another source necessities and find places to sleep. Saint-Vil is hosting a number of friends who lost their homes in his small apartment. “What I can do, I will do it, but it’s not easy because the situation is really complicated for everyone,” he said. Cuba rides out the storm People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier. “Life is what matters,” Alexis Ramos, a 54-year-old fisherman, said as he surveyed his destroyed home and shielded himself from the intermittent rain with a yellow raincoat. “Repairing this costs money, a lot of money.” Local media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground. “As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready,” President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X. The hurricane could worsen Cuba’s severe economic crisis, which already has led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages. Cuba’s National Institute of Hydraulic Resources reported accumulated rainfall of 15 inches (38 centimeters) in Charco Redondo and 14 inches (36 centimeters) in Las Villas Reservoir. Wednesday night, Melissa had top sustained winds near 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 21 mph (33 kph) according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered about 105 miles (170 kilometers) east-northeast of the central Bahamas and about 800 miles (1,285 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda. Authorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago’s southeast corner ahead of Melissa’s arrival. By late Thursday, Melissa is expected to pass just west of Bermuda. ___ Rodríguez reported from Havana, Myers from Santa Cruz, Jamaica, and Sanon from Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41Z","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam during late October 2025 caused catastrophic flooding in the ancient imperial city of Hue and the historic town of Hoi An, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

ancient town of Hoi An.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vietnam’s disaster management agency recorded more than 1,000 millimetres (39.4 inches) of rainfall over a 24-hour period ending late on Monday in parts of Hue and Hoi An.\n\nVietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said the volume of rainfall in Hue marked the highest ever for a 24-hour period since the country started its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue remains submerged by more than one metre (3.3ft) of water.\n\nImages showed a wide area of the ancient city, including the palace grounds, under murky waters.\n\nAuthorities in Hue were quoted by the state news agency Vietnam News as saying that the rain and flooding may last until Friday.\n\nThe area was designated a world heritage site in 1993 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe heavy rain also triggered a massive landslide of red mud on Tuesday morning about 3km (1.9 miles) long in coastal Quang Ngai province, leaving about 1,700 people isolated, authorities said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, more than 8,600 people in four central provinces were evacuated due to risks from severe flooding and landslides.\n\nHeavy flooding has also forced the state-run Vietnam Railways Corp to suspend services between the capital Hanoi and the business hub Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe government said in a separate report that more than 306,000 households and businesses in Hue, Danang and Quang Tri provinces were suffering from blackouts.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming increasingly powerful as the planet warms due to human-induced climate change.\n\nThis month’s rainfall comes after  Typhoon Bualoi  battered the country in September, leaving at least 13 people dead and 20 others missing.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office, natural disasters — mostly storms, floods and landslides — left 187 people

group Hamas earlier this month has provided a sliver of respite, repeated Israeli violations have left Palestinians constantly fearful of renewed attacks, unable to resume the lives they lived before  Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza  began in October 2023, let alone begin anew.\n\nOn Wednesday alone, more than 100 people, mostly women and children, were killed and 253 others injured in several Israeli air strikes on southern Gaza, the worst violation of the ceasefire.\n\nThe Israeli army launched some 10 air strikes on Khan Younis in southern Gaza early on Thursday. This is despite Israel’s assertion on Wednesday of a  “resumption” of the ceasefire  after a large wave of strikes it claims was carried out in retaliation for Hamas killing one of its soldiers in southern Gaza – an accusation Hamas denies.\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 211 people have been killed and 597 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire took effect.\n\n“While the ceasefire might technically exist, the sounds of the explosions, the sounds of gunfire coming from the eastern side [of Gaza], the deep mechanical hum of the drones … in the skies of the entire Gaza Strip is a constant reminder of how fragile this ceasefire has been so far,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, adding that it is also “a reminder that peace is out of reach in this region.\n\n“People always talk about how uncertain they are, how concerned they are of the ability of the ceasefire to hold … and to reduce the level of fear and trauma they have been experiencing.”\n\nIsrael’s attacks on Gaza are in violation of the ceasefire agreement that  came into effect on October 10  under US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan. Phase one includes the release of Israeli captives in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The plan also envisages the rebuilding of Gaza and the establishment of a new governing mechanism without Hamas.\n\nThe psychological impact of Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed at least 68,527 people and wounded 170,395, on Palestinians is profound; the relentless suffering is unimaginable.\n\n“We’re waiting for a real chance to try and rebuild our lives. We started to pick things up again during the first week or two after the war, but then the truce was breached; thankfully, it ended quickly. We hadn’t even caught our breath when the second breach happened,” Mazen Shaheen, a Gaza resident, told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany Palestinians are  losing hope  due to Israel’s continuous breaches of the ceasefire.\n\n“Now, after the truce and the new wave of bombings on Gaza, people who had just begun to feel some sense of safety, peace, and reassurance – who believed the war was finally over – are once again living in fear, especially the children and women,” Gaza City resident Hassan Lubbad told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn the streets of Gaza City, people talk about “how the ceasefire hasn’t brought any certainty or peace, only more questions of when the next strike will happen, will it enter more easily or will there be an end to this cycle of fear?” said Mahmoud.\n\nPalestinians are determined to send a message to the world about their thoughts on the ceasefire and their expectations of the international community.\n\n“The message we want to send is this: where are the international guarantees that were promised? Where are the mediating countries that helped broker the ceasefire and pledged to ensure its continuation?” said Shaheen.\n\nOne of Shaheen’s friends was wounded in Wednesday’s attacks. His friend’s condition is now stable, he said.\n\n“We want a complete end to the war, a total ceasefire. We just want to live in safety.

for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched a national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9–14, using the single-dose Cecolin vaccine developed in China.

papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and MD Anderson Cancer Center reveals that mRNA vaccines developed for COVID-19 may significantly improve survival in cancer patients by activating the immune system to recognize and attack tumors.

cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/five-more-arrested-in-france-over-louvre-jewellery-heist-says-prosecutor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:34:05+00:00","title":"Five more arrested in France over Louvre jewellery heist, says prosecutor","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major security breach, a group of intruders broke into the Apollo Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris on October 19, 2025, stealing eight priceless 19th-century jewellery pieces belonging to the wives of Napoleon I and Napoleon III.

Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP.

It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees.

Jamaica\n\nPeople in Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, referred to as the 'Storm of the century,' but due to the article being a live page that has now been closed and no actual content is provided, no specific details or named entities can be extracted or analyzed.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["hurricane","jamaica","storm","weather","climate"],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/netherlands-centrist-party-wins-big-in-election-as-far-right-loses-support","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:26:05+00:00","title":"Netherlands centrist party wins big in election as far right loses support","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 Dutch general election, the centre-left D66 party surged in support, making its largest gains and likely taking the lead in government formation talks, while the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) lost significant ground.

centrist party wins big in election as far right loses support\n\nThe centre-left D66 party has made huge gains in the Netherlands’ general election, with it likely taking the lead in government formation talks as the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) haemorrhaged support among voters.\n\nWith 90 percent of the votes counted early on Thursday, D66 and PVV were both projected to take 26 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament.\n\nThe results marked a sharp fall for PVV leader Geert Wilders, sometimes known as the “Dutch Trump”, from  a record showing in 2023 , while D66 made the biggest gains and almost tripled its seats.\n\nExit polls and early results had  indicated a narrow victory for the progressive D66 , with Wilders, 62, trailing in second place. But vote counting indicated a slightly stronger showing for Wilders.\n\nWhatever the final result, Wilders is virtually certain not to be prime minister, as all mainstream parties have ruled out governing with him.\n\nWilders on Wednesday evening said he was disappointed that his party had lost seats and acknowledged that he would likely not be part of the next government. But he promised to fight on from the opposition.\n\n“Of course, we would have liked to win more seats, and I regret the loss, but it’s not as if we were wiped off the map,” he said.\n\nThe result instead opens a path for D66 leader Rob Jetten, 38, to form a government as the country’s youngest and first openly gay prime minister.\n\nCheers and chants of “Yes, we can” broke out at the D66 election night celebration as the crowd waved Dutch flags.\n\n“We’ve shown not only to the Netherlands, but also to the world that it is possible to beat populist and extreme right movements,” Jetten told the crowd.\n\n“Millions of Dutch people today turned a page and said farewell to the politics of negativity, of hate, of endless ‘No we can’t’.”\n\nJetten’s popularity surged in the past month, as he campaigned on a promise to resolve a housing shortage, invest in education, and tackle  immigration concerns .\n\nWilders, one of Europe’s longest-serving populist leaders, is known for his virulent anti-Muslim stance and lives under constant protection due to death threats. He had proposed denying all asylum requests – which would violate European Union treaties – sending male Ukrainian refugees back to their wartorn nation, and halting development aid in order to finance energy and healthcare.\n\nWilders led his party to a stunning first-place finish in the last election in 2023 and formed an all-conservative coalition, although his partners refused to endorse him as prime minister. He brought the government down in June over its refusal to adopt his hardline measures.\n\nThe Dutch election was seen as a test of whether the far right can expand its reach or whether it has peaked in parts of Europe, with the outcome suggesting there are limits to its enduring appeal.\n\nWith 76 seats needed to form a governing coalition in the Netherlands’ parliament, at least four parties will be required. One scenario is a pact including D66, the conservative Christian Democrats, the centre-right VVD, and the Greens-Labour party.\n\nHowever, building stable coalitions is difficult and talks are expected to take months."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' reports on a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, described as a 'storm of the century,' but no substantive details are provided due to the live page being closed and the article now inaccessible.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/pakistan-afghanistan-to-resume-talks-amid-tensions-over-border-clashes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:30:38+00:00","title":"Pakistan, Afghanistan to resume talks amid tensions over border clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to resume diplomatic talks in Istanbul, following a weeklong border conflict and earlier failed negotiations.

at the request of mediator Turkiye after earlier rounds between Islamabad and Kabul  failed  to resolve spiralling tensions between the neighbours that have exploded into military clashes in recent weeks.\n\nPakistani security officials said Islamabad’s delegation had been planning to depart from the Turkish city after a previous round of talks, spanning four days, ended in a deadlock. Now, however, the team will remain in Istanbul to continue negotiations on Thursday.\n\n“Pakistan has once again stressed that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. We appreciate the constructive role of our hosts and remain committed to seeking a peaceful resolution in good faith,” a security official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the dialogue.\n\nAfghan media have also reported, quoting sources, that after the intervention of host Turkiye and mediator Qatar, the two countries have agreed to resume their talks, which had ended earlier this week.\n\nThe two neighbours were engaged in a  weeklong border conflict  this month in which both sides suffered casualties. After the skirmishes, mediation by Qatar and Turkiye led to a ceasefire signed by the defence ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan on  October 19 in Doha  in the presence of officials from both mediating nations.\n\nThe subsequent round of talks began in  Istanbul on Saturday  and continued for four days, but the parties failed to reach a consensus on Islamabad’s central demand that Kabul crack down on Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an armed group often called the Pakistan Taliban, which has been long accused by Pakistan of carrying out deadly attacks inside its territory.\n\nThe TTP emerged in 2007 during the US-led “war on terror” and has since waged a sustained campaign against the Pakistani state. Islamabad accuses Kabul of providing sanctuary not only to the TTP but also to other armed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP). The Afghan Taliban denies the allegations.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban, who took power for a second time in August 2021 after the withdrawal of US forces, has maintained that the TTP issue is an internal Pakistani matter. They have also long considered ISKP a rival and enemy.\n\nAfter Pakistan confirmed the failure of the previous talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a lengthy statement on X, warning of an all-out attack against the Afghan Taliban. He accused the “regime” of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them.”\n\n“The warmongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage,” Asif wrote on Wednesday.\n\nSo far, the Afghan Taliban has not responded to Asif’s remarks.\n\nSweden-based security researcher Abdul Sayed, who studies armed groups in South and Central Asia, said Asif’s comments signalled that Pakistan was prepared to resume air strikes in Afghanistan but the decision to return to negotiations reflected a potential shift.\n\n“The resumption of dialogue suggests either that the issue causing the earlier deadlock has been resolved or that the Pakistani delegation, at the mediators’ request, has shown flexibility in its stance to make another attempt to resolve the matter through negotiation,” Sayed told Al Jazeera.\n\nAsif, in an interview to a TV channel on Wednesday, also alleged that India was waging a “low intensity” war in Pakistan through the Afghan Taliban, claiming Islamabad possesses evidence of Indian involvement. He, however, did not share any evidence to back his claim.\n\nPakistan and India engaged in a  four-day conflict  in May. While New Delhi accuses Islamabad of harbouring armed groups that launch cross-border attacks, Pakistan has historically alleged that India supports Baloch separatist groups demanding an independent Balochistan, Pakistan’s mineral-rich province.\n\nThis year, however, also saw a thaw in relations between the Afghan Taliban and the Indian government. A series of meetings and diplomatic exchanges culminated in a  visit to New Delhi  by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi this month.\n\nSayed noted the recent escalation along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border began during Muttaqi’s visit to India.\n\n“Pakistan has long maintained that India uses Afghan territory to create challenges for it. Even during the rule of the Afghan Taliban, traditionally Pakistan’s longstanding allies, these concerns persisted,” he said.\n\n“Within the tensions of Islamabad-Kabul relations, India remains a crucial factor,” Sayed added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a major hurricane impacting Jamaica, but no actual content or details are available due to the page being closed.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major milestone in its space program.

milestone” it says will help advance national objectives from agriculture to urban planning.\n\nThe country’s space agency, SUPARCO, announced the “successful launch” of the H1 satellite from northwestern China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on Sunday.\n\nHyperspectral satellites can detect subtle chemical or material changes on the ground that traditional satellites cannot, making them especially useful for things like tracking crop quality, water resources or damage from natural disasters.\n\nPakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the technology is expected to “significantly enhance national capacities” in fields like precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning and disaster management.\n\nIt said its ability to pinpoint geohazard risks will also contribute to development initiatives such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which  seeks to build infrastructure linking  China’s northwestern Xinjiang province with Pakistan’s Gwadar

optimised management of the country’s vital natural resources,” SUPARCO chairman Muhammad Yousuf Khan was quoted as saying in Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper.\n\nPakistan also hailed H1’s deployment as a “pivotal step forward” in its space programme, as well as a reflection of its longstanding partnership with China in the “peaceful exploration of space”.\n\n“The mission reflects the ever-growing strategic partnership and deep-rooted friendship between the two nations, who continue to cooperate in advancing peaceful space exploration and harnessing its benefits for socioeconomic development,” said the Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe mission is part of a recent push in Pakistan to grow its space programme, which has sent three satellites into orbit this year, according to SUPARCO.\n\nThe two other satellites – EO-1 and KS-1 – are “fully operational in orbit”, reported Pakistan’s The News International newspaper.\n\nIt may take about two months to calibrate the H1 satellite’s systems before it is fully operational this year, according to a SUPARCO spokesperson quoted in Pakistani media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1344","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:56:35+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine

The Russian president said about the Poseidon: “There is nothing like this in the world in terms of the speed and the depth of the movement of this unmanned vehicle – and it is unlikely there ever will be.”\n\nA nuclear-powered platform or weapon – whether an aircraft carrier, missile or drone – draws its propulsion from nuclear fission instead of traditional fuels. But a nuclear-powered object isn’t automatically a nuclear weapon: nuclear power also generates a 10th of the world’s electricity.\n\nA nuclear-capable weapon, like the Poseidon, could, however, become a nuclear weapon: It is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.\n\nBut for now, Russia has tested these weapons without any nuclear warhead.\n\nMost countries stopped testing nuclear weapons after they signed the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) starting from 1996. The treaty emerged amid growing concerns about human health and the environment above the ground, underground and underwater, from nuclear pollution.\n\nThe US conducted its first nuclear test in 1945. In all, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations. The US last tested nuclear weapons in 1992. It signed the CTBT in 1996 but never ratified it.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests, the last of them in 1990. Since the USSR’s dissolution in 1990, Russia – which inherited the former superpower’s nuclear arsenal – has not conducted any nuclear tests. In 1996, Russia signed the CTBT, ratifying it in 2000. But Putin revoked Russia’s ratification of the treaty in 2023.\n\nChina last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests between 1945 and 1996.\n\nThe United Kingdom conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952, with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nSince the CTBT came into effect, 10 nuclear tests have taken place.\n\nIn 1998, India and Pakistan conducted two nuclear tests each. India and Pakistan have never signed the CTBT.\n\nAccording to the UN, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2017. It conducted two tests in 2016. North Korea has also not signed the CTBT.\n\nNine states have nuclear arms, including the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nFor decades, Israel has maintained nuclear ambiguity, also known as “opacity”. It has never publicly confirmed or denied the presence of its nuclear weapons programme.\n\nThe CTBT bans all nuclear explosions, for military and civilian reasons, anywhere on Earth.\n\nBut while the US has signed the CTBT, it is not legally obliged to follow it since Washington never ratified it.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it is expressing general agreement with the treaty’s contents and its intention to comply with the treaty in the future. But it is when a country ratifies a treaty that it confirms that it has completed the necessary domestic legal steps to put the treaty into action. Ratification makes a treaty legally binding for a country under international law.\n\nIf history is any guide, then yes.\n\nThat’s what happened at the dawn of the nuclear age.\n\nAmid Cold War tensions, the US atomic weapons programme became a source of anxiety for the Soviet Union, and a focus of espionage between the rivals. The USSR became the world’s second nation with nuclear weapons after a successful test in 1949.\n\nBritain followed in 1952, and France in 1960.\n\nBy the late 1950s, as China and the Soviet Union split over the direction of the global communist movement and its leadership, Beijing feared military attacks from its northern neighbour. China tested its first nuclear bomb in 1964 – its atomic programme was initially aided in the early 1950s by Moscow.\n\nNuclear one-upmanship was also on display when India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons within days of each other in 1998.\n\nIn June this year, a report by SIPRI warned that the world was on the brink of a  new nuclear arms race .\n\nWhile the overall number of nuclear warheads around the world is falling – largely because the US and Russia have been dismantling old warheads – new warheads are still being produced and added to arsenals.\n\nThe SIPRI report warned that in the absence of agreements that limit or reduce stockpiles, these new additions could eventually outnumber the warheads being decommissioned.\n\nGuardrails that focus on controlling and limiting nuclear arms have weakened in recent years.\n\nIran has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Its  recent threat  came in June during its war with Israel.\n\nThe NPT is an international treaty that was open for signing on July 1, 1968, and came into force on March 5, 1970.\n\nThe treaty decrees that nuclear-weapon states will not transfer nuclear weapons or assist non-nuclear-weapon states in developing them. It also makes non-nuclear-weapon states agree not to seek or acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Israel never signed the NPT. While North Korea signed the treaty in 1985, it withdrew its signature in 2003.\n\nRussia’s withdrawal of its ratification of the CTBT in 2023 means Moscow is no longer obliged to adhere to a no-tests policy.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union signed several treaties and agreements to control the nuclear arms race. However, most of these have lapsed or fallen apart.\n\nFor instance, in 1972, the two signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, but the US withdrew from it in 2002.\n\nIn 1979, both sides negotiated terms for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II (SALT II) treaty. The US signed the treaty but never ratified it, and withdrew from it in 1980 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nIn 1987, the two sides signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The US withdrew from this in 2019, alleging that Russia was violating its terms."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/tropical-storm-melissa-soon-a-hurricane-brings-death-floods-to-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:03:42+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa rapidly intensifies, threatening major Caribbean flooding","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa has rapidly intensified into a powerful storm with sustained winds of 120 km/h, threatening the Caribbean.

National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.\n\nThe centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.\n\nA hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.\n\nAlready, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.\n\nJamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.\n\nThe forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nThe storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.\n\nIn the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.\n\nMore than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.\n\n“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMelissa is also forecast to strike eastern Cuba as a major hurricane on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/30/live-palestinians-lose-hope-in-ceasefire-after-israeli-strike-wave-on-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:03:08+00:00","title":"‘Calm turns to despair’ in Gaza as Israeli strikes shake hope in ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Gaza, Israeli strikes have killed over 100 people, predominantly children, causing deep despair and undermining the credibility of a recently proposed ceasefire.

Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have  agreed to a trade truce  under which the US will ease tariffs and Beijing will restart imports of US soya beans, delay the introduction of export restrictions on some of its rare earth metals and intensify efforts to curb illegal fentanyl trafficking.\n\nSpeaking after his meeting on Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea – their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 – Trump described the meeting as the capstone of his five-day Asia tour.\n\n“I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nThe short duration of Trump and Xi’s talks – about one hour and 40 minutes – took some observers by surprise.\n\nShan Guo, a partner at the Shanghai-based consultancy Hutong Research, said the “shorter-than-expected” meeting likely suggests both sides limited discussions to topics that had already been settled in advance.\n\nAlthough no official timetable was released, Trump had earlier suggested the talks could last up to four hours.\n\nBut Trump said the result overall was “amazing”, adding that the meeting “was a 12 with 10 being best”.\n\nInstead, the two countries have agreed to a “truce” in their trade war, which has been raging on and off for the past year.\n\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera the agreement could be seen as a “partial freeze” or “minor rollback” in the US-China trade war.\n\nThe two countries agreed to the following for a period of one year – to be renegotiated and renewed after that time:\n\nSemiconductors, which are crucial for the development of artificial intelligence (AI), have been a key source of tension between Washington and Beijing since former US President Joe Biden’s administration imposed export controls on US-made semiconductors to limit China’s access to advanced chips used in AI development.\n\nOne of the most closely watched companies in this dispute is Nvidia, a leading US chipmaker whose processors power most of the world’s AI systems.\n\nNvidia’s new Blackwell AI processors, unveiled this year, are considered central to its dominance in the global AI race and are among the technologies restricted under US export rules.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has tried to persuade the Trump administration to loosen the controls, saying Chinese AI’s dependence on US hardware was good for the US.\n\nDuring his meeting with Xi, Trump said he had discussed semiconductor trade with China but the talks did not involve the Blackwell processors. “China is going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips,” he said, adding, “We’re not talking about the Blackwell.”\n\nThe agreement by China to delay export restrictions on rare earth metals represents another key area of strategic importance in the US-China relationship – one that, like semiconductors, sits at the intersection of trade and technology, and national security.\n\nNo details of the deal have been made public yet, but analysts believe it could be a major “win” for Trump.\n\n“Rare earths are critical for the production of everything from smartphones to headphones to, of course, military defence weaponry, fighter jets and tanks,” Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu said, reporting from Beijing. “This is a national security issue for Trump, and the problem for him is that China dominates this industry.”\n\nChina produces more than 70 percent of the world’s processed rare earth metals and rare earth magnets, according to the Washington, DC-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nYu added that even if a deal has been struck, China is still likely to “use rare earths as leverage in any negotiations it has with the United States going forward”.\n\nSoya beans and fentanyl have long been flashpoints in US-China relations, symbolising the economic and political stakes on both sides.\n\nSoya beans  are the top farm product the US exports abroad, and China is one of the top buyers. During the trade war this year when China and the US slapped each other with tariffs exceeding 100 percent before agreeing a pause in May, China stopped buying US soya beans, causing exports to plunge and hurting farmers across the US Midwest, a key Trump political base.\n\nA resumption of Chinese purchases would provide both an economic boost and a symbolic political win for the Trump administration. However, soya bean futures in Chicago slipped after the summit as traders were disappointed with the lack of concrete details about agricultural commitments.\n\nFentanyl, a highly addictive drug which is 50 times stronger than heroin, remains at the centre of the US opioid crisis, contributing to tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year. Washington has repeatedly accused Chinese suppliers of exporting the precursor chemicals used to manufacture it.\n\nChina previously pushed back on Trump’s accusations, saying it has done more than required to meet its obligations on narcotics control.\n\nAccording to Chinese state media reports on Thursday, Xi told Trump that China does not seek to challenge or replace any other country and instead focuses on “doing its own business well”.\n\nHe described China’s economy as “an ocean”, adding that the country is confident and capable of handling all kinds of risks and challenges.\n\nXi said China-US relations remain generally stable and both sides’ teams should refine and follow up on the consensus reached.\n\nThe reports said Xi also “called on both sides to focus on long-term benefits brought by cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of retaliation”.\n\nBeijing also confirmed Trump’s visit to China next year.\n\nIn response to a reporter’s question, Trump declined to provide more details about this part of the talks but emphasised the scale of potential trade.\n\nThe question of China’s access to Nvidia’s chips remains a major point of US-China tech tension.\n\nEinar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute in Beijing, said Trump’s decision to ease tariffs on Chinese goods from 57 percent to 47 percent “means nothing”.\n\n“Any economist will tell you, tariffs 30 percent or above mean that you effectively end trade,” Tangen told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s kind of an indication to me that there wasn’t as much progress [in these talks] as Donald Trump is trying to hint at,” he added.\n\nTangen said Beijing would have hoped the Trump administration would have lowered its tariffs to 20 or 25 percent, or 30 percent “at most”, putting them “on parity with the rest of the world”.\n\nHe added that until a joint communique is released, it would be hard to gauge just how successful this meeting really was."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/trump-says-us-to-resume-nuclear-weapons-tests-backs-s-korean-nuclear-sub","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:09:59+00:00","title":"Trump says US to resume nuclear weapons tests, backs S Korean nuclear sub","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Defense to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing on an equal basis with other nuclear-armed states, citing growing nuclear activity by China and other nations.

sub\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump says he has ordered the Department of Defense to “immediately” resume nuclear weapons testing on an “equal basis” with other nuclear-armed powers.\n\nThe US leader also said on Thursday that he gave ally South Korea the green light to build its own nuclear-powered submarine after successful trade negotiations with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Jae Myung.\n\nWriting on his Truth Social platform shortly before his summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the South Korean city of Busan, Trump said that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump added that he ordered the resumption due to “other countries [nuclear] testing programs”.\n\n“I have instructed the Department of War [Department of Defense] to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Trump meant flight testing of nuclear-capable missiles or nuclear-explosive testing, which would be carried out by the National Nuclear Safety Administration.\n\nChina has  rapidly expanded  its nuclear warhead stockpile to about 600 in recent years, adding about 100 per year since 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The Pentagon estimated that Beijing will have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030.\n\nThe Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation (CACNP) estimated that Russia currently possesses 5,459 nuclear warheads, of which 1,600 are actively deployed.\n\nThe US has about 5,550 nuclear warheads, according to the CACNP, with about 3,800 of those active. At its peak in the mid-1960s during the Cold War, the US stockpile consisted of more than 31,000 active and inactive nuclear warheads.\n\nFormer Republican US President George HW Bush issued a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The US last exploded a nuclear device in 1992.\n\nOnly three countries have detonated nuclear devices since 1996, the year the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was opened for signatures – India in 1998, Pakistan twice in 1998 and North Korea on five occasions.\n\nTrump also announced on Thursday that he had approved US support for South Korea building its own nuclear-powered submarine.\n\nTrump said the move would replace South Korea’s “old fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel powered Submarines”. He added that the submarine would be built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the South Korean firm Hanwha runs a shipyard.\n\nThe dramatic move is set to admit Seoul to a small club of nations that possess such vessels, namely the US, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and India.\n\nAt their meeting on Wednesday, Lee pushed Trump to revise the countries’ nuclear energy agreement to allow Seoul greater flexibility in reprocessing spent nuclear fuel and uranium enrichment.\n\nThe longstanding pact restricts Seoul to enriching uranium to levels below 20 percent, and it is prohibited from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel without US consent.\n\nLee said revising these restrictions would allow South Korea to have fuel “supply for nuclear-powered submarines”. Crucially, he emphasised that his government was looking for nuclear fuel rather than weapons.\n\n“If fuel supply is permitted, we can build several submarines equipped with conventional weapons using our own technology to defend the waters around the Korean Peninsula, ultimately reducing the burden on US forces,” Lee said.\n\nTrump did not say where South Korea would get the propulsion technology needed for a nuclear-powered submarine. The US has only once before shared that technology – with the UK in the 1950s."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/tanzania-police-fire-shots-tear-gas-at-protesters-after-chaotic-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:14:17+00:00","title":"Tanzania police fire shots, tear gas at protesters after chaotic election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a contentious presidential election in Tanzania, protests erupted in the capital Dar-es-Salaam, where police responded with gunfire and tear gas, resulting in at least two deaths.

homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

So many homes, so many people have been displaced,” she said.\n\n“We did prepare, but there wasn’t much that we could have done.”\n\nTrout Hall Rd,  Clarendon #TrackingMelissa   #HurricaneMelissa   #Jamaica   @CVMTV   pic.twitter.com/bTop93pOvp\n\n— Giovanni R. Dennis (@GiovanniRDennis)  October 28, 2025\n\nIn Kingston, Lisa Sangster, a 30-year-old communications specialist, said her home was devastated by the storm.\n\n“My sister … explained that parts of our roof were blown off and other parts caved in and the entire house was flooded,” she told the AFP news agency. “Outside structures like our outdoor kitchen, dog kennel and farm animal pens were also gone, destroyed.”\n\nMathue Tapper, 31, told AFP that those in the capital were “lucky”, but he feared for people in Jamaica’s more rural areas.\n\n“My heart goes out to the folks living on the western end of the island,” he said.\n\nAlthough Jamaica and Cuba are used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making the storms more severe.\n\nBritish-Jamaican climate change activist and author Mikaela Loach said in a video shared on social media that Melissa “gained energy from the extremely and unnaturally  hot seas  in the Caribbean”.\n\n“These sea temperatures are not natural,” Loach said. “They’re extremely hot because of the gases that have resulted from burning fossil fuels.”\n\n“Countries like Jamaica, countries that are most vulnerable to climate disaster, are also countries that have had their wealth and resources stripped away from them through colonial bondage,” Loach added.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting to the effects of a warming world.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2910-05-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera - Science and Technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A diverse range of scientific, technological, and policy developments are reported, including a US official's caution after former President Donald Trump made baseless claims linking Tylenol use to autism; rising mosquito populations in Iceland due to climate change; Pakistan’s rollout of the HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer; growing AI-related concerns about misinformation and data misuse; a massive AWS cloud outage; and the impact of geopolitical tensions on technology policy.

in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An AWS outage caused by a human error during a software update to DynamoDB’s API led to a cascading failure that affected 113 services, including major apps like Snapchat, WhatsApp, Roblox, Fortnite, banks, airlines, news outlets, and smart home devices.

outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kjw515pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"15:10:05.853+00:00","title":"Sudan war: New videos show executions after RSF militia takes key city","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New videos and satellite imagery reveal that fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have executed unarmed civilians in el-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur held by government forces.

graphic descriptions of executions.\n\nFighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have executed a number of unarmed people after capturing the Sudanese city of el-Fasher, new videos analysed by BBC Verify show.\n\nThe RSF, which has engaged in a brutal war with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for more than two years, seized a key military base in the city over the weekend after an extended siege.\n\nSeveral videos have since emerged showing men wearing military fatigues and some with what appear to be RSF patches carrying out extreme acts of violence around el-Fasher. The UN's Sudan coordinator said it had received \"credible reports of summary executions\" in the city during an interview with the BBC on Wednesday.\n\nBBC Verify has approached the RSF for comment. Imran Abdullah, an adviser to the paramilitary, denied the group's fighters were targeting civilians in an interview with the BBC on Monday.\n\nSudan has been ravaged by war since the conflict broke out in 2023, prompted by the collapse of the SAF and the RSF's fragile ruling coalition. More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes since then.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Denise Brown - the UN's Sudan coordinator - said she had received reports of executions against \"unarmed men in particular\" since the RSF entered el-Fasher. Killings of unarmed civilians or surrendering combatants is a war crime under the Geneva Convention.\n\nMost of the clips reviewed by BBC Verify are in dusty and sandy rural locations, making it hard to say where exactly they took place. However, we did geolocate one video showing the summary shooting of an unarmed man at a university building in el-Fasher.\n\nThe clip showed the unarmed man sitting amid dozens of dead bodies in a hallway. As the video progressed, he was seen turning towards the camera which followed an armed man who was descending the stairs. The fighter then raised his rifle and fired a single shot knocking the unarmed man to the ground, where he lay motionless.\n\nA number of similarly distressing clips are circulating online, but are difficult to geolocate as they are recorded outside the city itself where there are very few visible landmarks. But BBC Verify has managed to place one of the fighters who appeared in multiple execution videos in the area around el-Fasher in recent days.\n\nThe fighter, who goes by the name of Abu Lulu, has long had his activities with the RSF documented on a social media profile viewed by BBC Verify.\n\nA video which first appeared online over the weekend showed him amidst dead bodies in an area north-west of the city. Working with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR), BBC Verify has been able to confirm the location of this footage, but it's difficult to say whether the dead in the clip are civilians or SAF troops killed in fighting due to the quality of the video.\n\nBut Abu Lulu has also appeared in at least two videos which show him participating in the execution of unarmed men who are kneeling and under armed guard. Reverse image searches show all the videos have appeared online since the weekend.\n\nIn one video he was seen addressing an injured man lying on the ground, berating him for not sharing information before threatening to rape him. The RSF fighter then shot the captive several times using an automatic rifle.\n\nA separate video shows Abu Lulu standing alongside several RSF troops carrying AK-style assault rifles and guarding a group of at least nine unarmed captives. After addressing the men, Abu Lulu aimed his rifle at the group and opened fire. In the aftermath the other armed men raised their arms and cheered.\n\nIn another clip the fighter was seen standing alongside several other armed men with dozens of dead bodies visible in the background. Some of the fighters were wearing RSF style uniforms, one of which has a circular patch with a black line running around the circumference - consistent with the paramilitary's insignia.\n\nIn August the RSF said it would investigate Abu Lulu after he was accused of executing a captive. A statement said \"if it is proven that the perpetrator is indeed a member of our ranks, he will be held accountable without delay\".\n\nThe videos come after US-based researchers said that satellite images taken of el-Fasher since the city fell appear to show the aftermath of mass killings carried out in the streets of the city itself.\n\nAnalysts with the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab highlighted large \"clusters\" visible in the images, which they said were \"consistent with the size range of adult human bodies and are not present in previous imagery\".\n\nIn the report issued on Monday, Yale said that its analysts' observations were \"consistent with reports of executions\" shared online and by the UN and human rights groups in recent days and also highlighted \"discoloration\" which the analysts said may be human blood.\n\nWithout on-the-ground footage from that location, BBC Verify cannot independently confirm Yale's findings.\n\nOther satellite images viewed by BBC Verify appeared to show vehicles parked at each end of several streets. Yale analysts noted that their positioning appeared to suggest that the paramilitary was carrying out house-to-house clearance operations. In some areas, clusters that Yale identified as human bodies were seen near the vehicles.\n\nMichael Jones, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said the RSF has a track record of carrying out ethnically-based summary killings which could be partially attributed to the paramilitary's \"decentralised composition\".\n\n\"The bulk of the group's manpower comes from a messy confederation of rented militia, local allies and economic opportunists, who are often motivated by interests or grievances that pre-date the April 2023 conflict,\" he told BBC Verify.\n\n\"Although likely playing out under the umbrella of RSF policy, the violence can sometimes be decentralised, with perpetrators settling personal or communal vendettas, seizing assets or land, and participating in ethnic cleansing to consolidate their own political power.\"\n\nIn recent months the SAF has made several major gains against the RSF, including recapturing the capital Khartoum, so that the army now controls most of the north and the east of the country.\n\nBy contrast the RSF controls almost all of Darfur in the west and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region - the traditional base of its predecessor, the Janjaweed paramilitary which carried out ethnic killings in Darfur between 2003 and 2005. Many of those who fought with the Janjaweed are believed to have joined the RSF.\n\nUntil now el-Fasher was the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies. The RSF has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in the city when it had assumed control there.\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes since the conflict began and in the closing days of President Joe Biden's administration the US said the RSF had carried out acts of genocide. BBC Verify has  previously documented mass killings carried out by the RSF  following the defection of a senior commander.\n\nAdditional reporting by Kumar Malhotra, Benedict Garman, Richard Irvine-Brown, Daniele Palumbo, Paul Myers and Thomas Copeland."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3xq9wx5zyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"00:47:50.764+00:00","title":"Four killed in latest US boat strike in the Pacific","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 30, 2025, the US conducted a lethal strike in international waters of the Pacific Ocean, killing four men on a vessel suspected of transporting illegal drugs.

It didn't say too much beyond the fact that they had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\".\n\nTrump said they had \"come to a conclusion on many important points\", which will be announced soon.\n\nBut there has been no word yet on the sale of Chinese-owned TikTok's US operations, which analysts were expecting to be finalised during these talks.\n\nIt took 10 months - of retaliatory tariffs, a shaky truce, uncertainty for manufacturers and businesses world over - for Trump and Xi to meet.\n\n\"This is the meeting that resets globalisation in a post-Covid era,\" according to economist Prof Tim Harcourt from the University of Technology Sydney.\n\nSo, how did we get here?\n\nTrump kicked off his trade war with China well before \" Liberation Day \" in April - the date on which he unveiled levies on most countries, hitting both allies and foes.\n\nChina has long been in his crosshairs - for what he described as unfair trade practices - and was hit with tariffs in his first term too.\n\nEarly in his second term, in February, he announced 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports in - on top of those that already existed from his previous term.\n\nBeijing shot back with its own levies, and Trump responded again, taking US tariffs on China to 20% .\n\nAnd then on \"Liberation Day\" Trump threatened China with an additional 34% levy.  The tit-for-tat measures continued, with US tariffs reaching 145%, while Chinese levies touched 125%.\n\nThe staggering numbers left manufacturers and importers reeling and uncertain. Stock piled up in warehouses in China, as alarmed American businesses wondered how to find alternate supply chains overnight.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's global tariffs offensive also took aim at \"transshipments\" - Chinese-made goods that were being re-routed through other countries, such as Vietnam.\n\nBut Beijing did not back down. China was open to dialogue, it said again and again. But just as clear was that it was willing to take the pain.\n\nIt also managed to inflict pain. For instance, it targeted a key vote base of Trump's - farmers - when it began heaping levies on American agricultural imports, such as soybeans.\n\nTrump's attempts to cut off US companies, from Apple to Walmart, from Chinese manufacturing were also weakened by exemptions - and that, in turn, boosted Beijing's confidence.\n\nIn May, the two sides struck a fragile truce, agreeing to keep talking until they had a final deal.\n\nEven as the tariff talks continued, another sticking point in the US-China relationship returned: the fight over advanced chips, which go into everything from smartphones to AI applications.\n\nThey are essential for China's plan to transform its economy from the \"world's factory\" for basic products to the home for cutting-edge tech. And experts largely agree that despite huge talent, China's semiconductor industry trails behind that of the US.\n\nThe White House has been trying to limit China's access to the most advanced chips. This was happening even before Trump, but his administration has held on that tight leash, allowing only less-advanced semiconductors to be shipped to China.\n\nAt the heart of this strategy has been Nvidia, the world's most valuable company  - the chips it designs are widely regarded by the industry as the gold standard. China is a big enough market - earning it billions - that the firm even agreed to pay the US government 15% of its China sales in return for export licenses.\n\nBut Beijing then surprised the US by reportedly telling local firms not to buy from chips from America. Instead it  rallied its industries around domestic manufacturers  like Alibaba and Huawei.\n\nBeijing also launched an  anti-monopoly probe into Nvidia .\n\nThe measures underline what Beijing has long intended: to become more self-reliant, China policy analyst Stefanie Kam from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies says.\n\nIt has been investing heavily in tech and AI, encouraging firms to innovate and make big bets. This ability to use \"state-craft\" to rally specific sectors of the economy is partly what has made China appear more resilient during the negotiations with the US, she adds.\n\nChina is playing the long game, analysts believe - so rather than rush into a deal which may or may not last, it is investing in building industries that are less reliant on the West.\n\nBut its decision to play a long game doesn't necessarily mean China doesn't want a deal with the US.\n\nThere are limitations to Beijing's powers, says Prof Harcourt, noting its economic challenges at home, including  unemployment ,  weak spending  and a  property crisis .\n\nChina's leadership isn't constrained by democratic elections but it still faces pressure to keep its middle-class prosperous and ensure political stability, he noted.\n\n\"Washington would be fully aware of China's domestic difficulties... There is still pressure on China and they wouldn't want a long-term severe trade war.\"\n\nWhat Xi does want is to be able to walk into the talks with a strong hand. And so in October, China went on the offensive by tightening controls over rare earth exports.\n\nThe country has a near-monopoly in the processing of the critical minerals that go into electronics, green energy tech and military equipment like fighter jets.\n\nIt was a pivotal moment in the trade war.\n\nThe US's tech curbs threaten to slow China's progress, but restricting rare earths could halt entire industries, says Naoise McDonagh from Australia's Edith Cowan University.\n\nThe Chinese announcement on rare earths stunned the White House. Especially because it came after Trump said that the two sides had reached an agreement on the sale of TikTok's US business. A top US trade official called it a \"betrayal\" of the US-China truce.\n\nThe move served as a stark reminder of American dependence on Chinese resources. And it prompted a series of agreements between the US and Australia, Malaysia and Japan, all focused on US access to rare earths - a form of \"insurance\" for Washington to get hold of the minerals outside China, according to Prof Harcourt.\n\nThese deals happened as Trump and US negotiators sought to ease tensions with Beijing, and met with Chinese officials to set up Thursday's meeting.\n\nThe differences are huge, and the rivalry runs deep but \"there are lower-hanging fruits\", according to Prof Kam, such as China delaying its rare earth export curbs in exchange for lower tariffs.\n\nHowever fragile a deal might be, it could \"narrow the risk\" of any unexpected decisions in the months ahead, Prof Kam adds.\n\nBut experts warn that no truce between the US and China will last forever."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39+00:00","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by four environmental NGOs—Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies—reveals that 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel projects have been launched globally since 2021.

a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvy4w875vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:13:37.401+00:00","title":"Dutch centrist liberals neck and neck in close finish with populist Wilders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a closely contested Dutch election, centrist-liberal party D66, led by Rob Jetten, narrowly edges out populist Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in a 26-seat victory, marking the best result in D66's history.

populist Wilders\n\nRob Jetten's centrist-liberal party D66 are in a neck-and-neck race with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in the Dutch election, according to latest vote projections.\n\nWith about 98% of votes counted, both D66 and Wilders' Freedom Party were  heading for 26 seats in the 150-member parliament, a projection from Dutch news agency ANP said on Thursday.\n\nInitial exit polls had put Jetten in the lead. \"Millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity,\" he told supporters.\n\nA downbeat Wilders had earlier conceded the result was not what he wanted, having lost 11 seats, but said he had still achieved his second best result ever.\n\nAs the final few results trickled in on Thursday, Wilders took a narrow lead in the race, but it was so close that by the afternoon there were fewer than 2,000 votes between the two frontrunners.\n\nBoth parties won less than 17% of the national vote.\n\nThree other parties were not far behind, including the conservative liberals on 22 seats, followed by the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.\n\nWilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he  pulled the plug on his own coalition  in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.\n\nHe admits he has little hope of forming a government himself, but said on X on Thursday that if his party did top the vote he should have the first try. Even without a clear-cut victory, Jetten - who staged a remarkable campaign - would stand a stronger chance of leading the next administration.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 on just 12 seats, but the photogenic, 38-year-old liberal leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews.\n\nThe fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.\n\nJetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, despite the party mood among his supporters.\n\nThe conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and her party would be a good fit for any potential Jetten-led coalition.\n\nGoing into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party won 37 seats in November 2023, but many of those voters will have been put off by the realisation he would struggle to find parties to work with him again.\n\nIt took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later.\n\nRob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.\n\nHe named the Labour(PvdA)-GreenLeft of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative liberals and a revitalised Christian Democrat CDA.\n\nHe is also likely to consider JA21, a populist right-wing party with 9 MPs, but his options are limited as he has to assemble a majority of at least 76 seats.\n\nThe exit poll spelt bad news for Frans Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth.\n\n\"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.\n\nTimmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.\n\nWilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"\n\nMatthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.\n\nBut, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.\n\nThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. As the exit polls became clear, the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.\n\nTaking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\n\n\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"\n\nThis election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.\n\nJetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\n\n\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"\n\nAnother potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 18.\n\n\"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl25xl1gjpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:24:05.426+00:00","title":"Trump hails 'amazing' meeting with Xi in South Korea","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant diplomatic event, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first face-to-face meeting in six years in South Korea, signaling a potential thaw in Sino-US tensions.

Trump hails 'amazing' meeting with Xi in South Korea\n\nUS President Donald Trump has hailed an \"amazing\" meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, amid rising hopes for a de-escalation of tensions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nBeijing was less effusive, saying the two side had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\" during the leaders' first face-to-face meeting in six years.\n\nTrump's trade war had set off tit-for-tat tariffs that shot past 100% on both sides, but they agreed to a truce in May - although tensions remained high.\n\nThursday's talks did not lead to a formal agreement but the announcements suggest they are closer to a deal - the details of which have long been subject to behind-the-scenes negotiations.\n\nTrade deals normally take years to negotiate, and countries around the world have been thrown into resolving differences with the current Trump administration within a matter of months.\n\nOne key win for Trump is that China has agreed to suspend export control measures it had placed on rare earths, crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets.\n\nA jubilant president told reporters on Air Force One that he had also got China to start immediately buying a \"tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products\". Retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans by Beijing had effectively halted imports from the US, harming US farmers - a key voting block for Trump.\n\nThere was, however,  no mention of a breakthrough on TikTok . The US has sought to take the video-sharing app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Beijing said afterwards it would continue to work to resolve the issues.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has said it will drop part of the tariffs it has levied on Beijing over the flow of ingredients used in making fentanyl to the US. Trump has imposed severe tariffs on the US's top trade partners for their perceived failure to clamp down on the drug.\n\nHowever, it seems other tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, will remain in place, meaning that goods arriving in the US from China are still being taxed at a rate of over 40% for US importers.\n\nBeijing will also be able to speak to Jensen Huang, the head of US tech firm Nvidia - according to Trump. Nvidia is at the heart of the two countries' fight over AI chips: China wants high-end chips but the US wants to limit China's access, citing national security.\n\nBeijing has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit China in April - yet another sign of thawing relations.\n\nBut the meeting also showed the gulf between the two leaders' approaches.\n\nXi was self-contained, and said only what he had prepared. He entered the meeting knowing he had a strong hand. China had learned from Trump's first term, leveraging its chokehold on rare earths, and diversifying its trade partners so it is less reliant on the US.\n\nAfterwards, he was far more measured in his language than Trump. The two sides would be working on delivering outcomes that will serve as a \"reassuring pill\" for both countries' economies, he said.\n\nTrump was - as always - more ad-lib. But the US president was also noticeably more tense than he had been for the rest of his whirlwind trip to South East Asia - a reflection of the high stakes in Thursday's meeting.\n\nThe glamour and pageantry on show since he arrived at his first stop in Malaysia just five days ago was also absent.\n\nGone were the gold-laden palaces of the sort he was welcomed to in Japan on Tuesday. Instead, a building at an airport, lying behind barbed wire and security checkpoints.\n\nThe military bands which welcomed Trump to South Korea on Wednesday were nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead, the only sign something important was going on inside was the heavy police and media presence.\n\nBut despite the quieter public face, what was happening inside was arguably the most significant hour and 20 minutes of the trip.\n\nHenry Wang, a former adviser to China's State Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump and Xi's talks \"went very well\".\n\nIt may not have been a trade deal, but a \"framework and structure has been laid\", he added - calling it \"a good start\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjdy5eevn2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:04:58.569+00:00","title":"Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 104, health ministry says, after Hamas accused of killing soldier","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On 29 October 2025, Israeli military strikes in Gaza killed at least 104 Palestinians, including 46 children and 20 women, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) responded to claims that Hamas violated a US-brokered ceasefire by killing an Israeli soldier and staging a false recovery of a deceased hostage's body.

strikes in Gaza on Tuesday night, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\" in response to violations by Hamas of the US-brokered ceasefire deal.\n\nIsrael's defence minister accused Hamas of an attack in Gaza that killed an Israeli soldier, and of breaching the terms on returning deceased hostages' bodies. Hamas said it had \"no connection\" to the attack and that Israel was trying to undermine the deal.\n\nUS President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire, but added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.\n\nThe Israeli strikes hit homes, schools and residential blocks in Gaza City and Beit Lahia in the north of Gaza, Bureij and Nuseirat in the centre, and Khan Younis in the south.\n\nWitnesses in Gaza City described seeing \"pillars of fire and smoke\" rising into the air as explosions shook several residential areas.\n\nGaza's health ministry said a total of 104 people were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, and that more than 250 others were injured.\n\nThree women and a man who were pulled from the rubble of the al-Banna family's home in the southern Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.\n\nIn the urban Bureij refugee camp, five members of the Abu Sharar family were killed in a strike on their home in the Block 7 area, it said.\n\nAt Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, women gathered to mourn over the bodies of a mother, Bayan al-Shawaf, and her four children who were killed in a strike on a tent at a camp for displaced families in the al-Mawasi area.\n\n\"What kind of world is this? Is this the ceasefire?\" asked Bayan's cousin, Umm Mohammed. \"They [the children] were sleeping. They were wanting to learn.\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday morning that it had \"begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire\" after carrying out a series of strikes on what it described as \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\", including at least 30 commanders of armed groups.\n\n\"The IDF will continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it,\" it added.\n\nA brief statement put out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Tuesday evening said he had ordered the IDF to carry out \"forceful strikes\" on Gaza but did not specify his reasons.\n\nHowever, his defence minister said Hamas had crossed \"a bright red line\" by launching an attack on Israeli soldiers in Gaza on Tuesday.\n\n\"Hamas will pay many times over for attacking the soldiers and for violating the agreement to return the fallen hostages,\" Israel Katz warned.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the IDF announced that a reservist soldier, Master Sergeant Yona Efraim Feldbaum, was killed.\n\nA military source said the attack took place in the southern city of Rafah on the Israeli side of the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates IDF-controlled territory inside Gaza under the ceasefire deal.\n\nSgt Feldbaum was killed when one of the vehicles of an IDF engineering team that was dismantling an underground tunnel route in Rafah was hit by fire from \"terrorists in the area\", according to the source.\n\n\"A few minutes later, several anti-tank missiles were fired at another armoured vehicle belonging to the troops in the area. No injuries were reported,\" they added.\n\nHamas insisted on Tuesday that it had \"no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah\".\n\nOn Wednesday, the group stressed that it remained committed to the ceasefire agreement and accused the Israel of seeking to undermine it with the strikes.\n\nThe US played down concerns that all-out hostilities could resume.\n\nOn board Air Force One, President Trump told reporters: \"As I understand it, they took out, they killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back.\"\n\n\"Nothing is going to jeopardise\" the ceasefire, he said. \"You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.\"\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said the reports of so many people being killed were \"appalling\" and urged all sides not to let the opportunity for peace \"slip from our grasp\".\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, hours after announcing it had resumed the ceasefire, the IDF said it had carried out a new air strike on a site in the northern town of Beit Lahia where weapons and \"aerial means\" intended for an imminent attack were stored.\n\nPalestinian media reported that one person was killed in the al-Salateen area.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Israel's prime minister had pledged to take unspecified \"steps\" against Hamas after the group handed over the previous day a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased hostages still in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu's office said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, an Israeli hostage whose body was recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023, and that this constituted a \"clear violation\" of the ceasefire deal.\n\nThe IDF also released footage from a drone that it said showed Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" in eastern Gaza City on Monday.\n\n\"Shortly afterwards,\" it added, the operatives \"summoned representatives of the Red Cross and staged a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"\n\nHamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) later condemned what it called the \"fake recovery\", saying it had attended the scene \"at the request of Hamas\" and \"in good faith\".\n\nIt went on: \"The ICRC team at this location were not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage – in general, our role as neutral intermediary does not include unearthing of the bodies of the deceased.\n\n\"Our team only observed what appeared to be the recovery of remains without prior knowledge of the circumstances leading up to it.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.\"\n\nThe ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey is supposed to implement the first stage of Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan.\n\nIt said Hamas would return its 48 living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect on 10 October.\n\nAll 20 living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\n\nIsrael has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.\n\nEleven of the dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the group was facing challenges because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\". He also said that \"some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them\".\n\nHowever, the Israeli government insists Hamas knows the locations of all the bodies.\n\nAlthough the ceasefire deal appeared to acknowledge that Hamas might not be able to return all the deceased hostages within the original timeframe, Trump warned the group on Saturday that it had to hand over those remaining \"quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action\".\n\nAll but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.\n\nIsrael responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than  68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr4xpyrkdqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"00:16:42.691+00:00","title":"How China really spies on the UK in 2025","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the evolving nature of China’s espionage against the UK in 2025, moving beyond traditional spy networks to include large-scale cyber operations, bulk data collection, political influence, and economic dependency.

offered conflicting accounts about whether a failure or unwillingness to label China as an active threat to national security led to the withdrawal of the charges. And yesterday Lord Hermer, the attorney general,  blamed \"out of date\" legislation  for the case's collapse.\n\nBut this all raises the question of what exactly Chinese espionage looks like in the modern world.\n\nOn one level, China spies within the traditional framework of the old ways of human espionage associated with the Cold War, with spies working under the cover of being diplomats, and recruiting people to pass secrets.\n\nThe witness statement by a deputy national security adviser for prosecutors investigating the now-collapsed case of Cash and Berry outlines this kind of work.\n\n\"The Chinese Intelligence Services are interested in acquiring information from a number of sources, including policymakers, government staff and democratic institutions and are able to act opportunistically to gather all information they can.\"\n\nHere is the thing though. Pretty much every country does this kind of spying - wanting insight into what other countries are up to is as old as the hills. The UK conducts this kind of espionage against China (as China itself has publicly complained about). When countries get caught there is normally a public row but each side knows it is normal business.\n\nBut this barely covers the breadth of the Chinese behaviour that  worries security officials.\n\n\"Try not to think too much just in terms of classic card-carrying spies based out of the embassy in the John le Carre mould,\" the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum said during a briefing on national security threats earlier this month.\n\nFor what truly sets China apart - and what lies at the heart of the problem - is that the national security threats China poses go beyond traditional notions of espionage.\n\nTo complicate matters further, some of the threats are also closely tied up with the reasons many believe we need to engage with China.\n\nChina's economic power, for example, presents many potential benefits for a UK desperate for growth.\n\nLabour is reported to be  seeking to improve ties with China.  However, securing the benefits of a relationship while navigating the associated risks is the hard task that has bedevilled governments.\n\nThe sheer size of Chinese intelligence – which some estimates put at half a million when you account for the entire workforce operating on security both at home and abroad – means they can afford to pursue their work at a larger scale than many other countries.\n\nEvery country uses its intelligence services differently - how it does so throws a spotlight on the priorities of the state - and in China, the top priority is ensuring the continued rule of the Communist Party.\n\nIn practice this has meant influencing political debate abroad, going after dissidents, collecting data at a large scale and  ensuring economic growth  at home.\n\nIn the UK, concerns about Chinese political influence have been growing.\n\nMI5 issued an \"interference alert\" in January 2022 about the activities of an alleged  Chinese agent, Christine Lee,  who was believed to have infiltrated Parliament.\n\nMs Lee denied the allegations. She later took unsuccessful legal action against MI5, and told a tribunal that the spy agency's alert about her carried a \"political purpose\".\n\nMI5 has also warned that Beijing was cultivating local politicians in the early stages of their career with the hope of seeding them into more senior positions - a sign of a long-term, patient strategy to build influence.\n\nHere, the purpose was not stealing secrets or gaining information so much as  manipulating political debate  – having people in influential positions who will take a pro-China view of issues and the world.\n\nAnother area that worries UK security officials is China's predilection for spying on dissidents, known as transnational repression, something that has been a primary target for Chinese intelligence for years with a focus on groups like Tibetan campaigners.\n\nBut the arrival in the UK of many young pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong, following Beijing's clampdown, has heightened the concerns.\n\nAccording to MI5, Hong Kong police have issued bounties against more than a dozen pro-democracy activists here in the UK and there have been increased reports of harassment and surveillance.\n\nBeijing has always dismissed accusations of espionage as attempts to \"smear\" China.\n\n\"China never interferes in other countries' internal affairs and always acts in an open and aboveboard manner,\" the Chinese embassy in London has previously said.\n\nIn a statement issued earlier this month, it added: \"The so-called 'China spy-case' hyped up by the UK is entirely fabricated and self-staged. China strongly condemns this...\n\n\"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat to any country. We firmly oppose attempts to smear China by peddling unfounded allegations of 'spying activities, or concocting the so-called 'China threat'.\"\n\nYet China has been linked to some large scale cyber operations. Some of this sits within modern notions of espionage – stealing secrets.\n\nLast year Beijing was accused of  trying to hack into the emails of MPs .\n\n\"China represents an economic threat to our security and an epoch-defining challenge,\" Rishi Sunak, the then-prime minister, said at the time, while avoiding formally labelling Beijing as a \"threat\".\n\nThen, in August, the UK finally revealed what many suspected – that it had been hit as part of a highly sophisticated espionage campaign codenamed Salt Typhoon, which compromised telecoms companies around the world.\n\nThe UK remained quiet about who exactly was hit and only spoke out in conjunction with a dozen other countries and after months of discussion behind the scenes about what it should say.\n\n\"The data stolen through this activity can ultimately provide the Chinese intelligence services the capability to identify and track targets' communications and movements worldwide,\" the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of GCHQ, warned in a statement.\n\nThe US had spoken out months earlier, and there it has been reported that senior politicians, including Donald Trump and JD Vance, had their communications targeted during the 2024 election.\n\nNow, in the UK,  plans for a new Chinese Embassy  at the former Royal Mint building in London have drawn attention for fears that it could offer the chance for espionage by tapping data cables which run underground beneath it.\n\nBut some security officials downplay those dangers - not only because those cables can be physically protected and monitored - but because of Beijing's capacity for large cyber-espionage.\n\nThe reality is that it has shown itself perfectly capable of collecting data through remote cyber-access.\n\nThat kind of targeting, though, still sits broadly within traditional state-on-state espionage and the kind of thing Western governments carry out.\n\nIn fact it was the revelations about the scale of UK and US digital eavesdropping by former contractor Edward Snowden that may have spurred China to become more ambitious in cyber-space.\n\nBut in cyber-space, the real concern is broader.\n\nWhat is notable about Chinese intelligence activity online is an appetite for data on a massive scale. Beijing's pursuit of what is often called bulk data - large scale data sets which might contain financial, personal, health or other types of information - is what alarms Western security officials.\n\n\"China has been trying to collect population level data on British people,\" according to Ciaran Martin, a former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre.\n\n\"That may be useful to train artificial intelligence or to better understand the country or even influence opinion or possibly even to work out what our vulnerabilities are individually and collectively.\n\n\"It is not always effectively carried out but it is very different from the kind of 'normal' spying on government and politics that virtually all countries undertake.\n\n\"In this other respect, China is notable only for how brazen its spying sometimes is.\"\n\nSome of this data is stolen but sometimes it is suspected to be acquired through Chinese companies with access to the Western market.\n\nThere is one element that is trickiest for national security officials to deal with when it comes to China: how to balance the risks and the benefits of China's growing economic power.\n\nA priority for the Chinese state - and its spies - is ensuring economic growth.\n\nObservers often point to a kind of unspoken bargain: the Chinese public will tolerate the relative lack of political freedom and continued one-party rule as long as the state delivers economic benefits.\n\nThat is one reason that China has also been active for decades in pursuing economic as well as political and diplomatic secrets in a way Western countries have not.\n\nSometimes this has been business secrets of companies – whether designs for new products or negotiating positions.\n\nThere are types of sensitive information that are not state secrets, like high-tech research into a new advanced material at a university, which has military as well as civilian applications.\n\nMI5 says it is tackling \"a steady stream of attempts to lure UK academic experts\" in order to get hold of technology they are working on, often starting with approaches over networking sites like LinkedIn.\n\n\"In a world where the 'DNA' of military and economic power is built on ones-and-zeros [of digital information], when core intellectual property and process knowledge leak, entire industries can be upended - and with them move jobs, capital, and geopolitical leverage,\" says Andrew Badger, a former US intelligence official and co-author of an upcoming book, The Great Heist: China's Epic Campaign to Steal America's Secrets.\n\n\"The UK's current debate about how to prosecute spies, strengthen laws, and balance commerce with security should start from this historical truth: economic power can only be sustained with the resolute custody of secrets.\"\n\nAs China's economic power grows – especially in advanced technology – one of the hardest risks to measure is the UK and other Western states' dependence on China in critical fields, including electric vehicles and critical minerals used in manufacturing.\n\nThis underpinned the debate about the Chinese telecoms company Huawei building a large part of the country's new 5G phone infrastructure.\n\nChinese equipment was cheaper and often seen as better than those of competitors - but were there risks?\n\nIt was less about using it to spy - and more the fact that a relationship of dependency on another country for technology on which daily life depends opens the way to influence and even coercion. If you do something or say something Beijing does not like, could it cut you off?\n\nIn the end, technology from Huawei - which always denied it was a security risk - was excluded from 5G. But it was only the first Chinese company to go global and now there are many more.\n\nSo, does it matter if China builds new nuclear reactors? Or becomes the main supplier of green technology? And what about if people depend on the Chinese-originated social media platform TikTok for their news and information?\n\nThis is the area where the tension with the economic growth agenda become clearest. China is the second largest economy in the world, an important export market and source of investment. If we want to secure the benefits of this relationship then it becomes much harder to exclude Chinese companies from the UK market.\n\nAny kind of blanket ban on Chinese technology or companies would be absurd. But just how much should we open ourselves?\n\nThe other challenge for Britain is that, in many of these areas where economic and national security mix, the US is taking a tougher stance - and Washington is seeking to pressure London to come into line.\n\nThat leaves London caught between pressure from Beijing and Washington and trying to work out how to address these threats while also maintaining productive relationships.\n\nNone of this is easy - and not much of it is to do with traditional spying. In this new world, threats are far broader and more complex.\n\nBut without a clear, consistent China strategy that is confidently expressed, this government – like previous governments - will continue to find it hard to know how to navigate.\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

evidence of systematic killings in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher have prompted human rights and aid activists to describe the civil war between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the military as a \"continuation of the Darfur genocide\".\n\nThe fall of el-Fasher, in the Darfur region, after an 18-month RSF siege brings together the different layers of the country's conflict – with echoes of its dark past and the brutality of its present-day war.\n\nThe RSF emerged from the Janjaweed, Arab militias who massacred hundreds of thousands of Darfuris from non-Arab populations, in the early 2000s.\n\nThe paramilitary force has been accused of ethnic killings since its power struggle with the army erupted into violence in April 2023. The RSF leadership has consistently denied the accusations - although on Wednesday its leader  Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\"  in el-Fasher.\n\nThe current charges are based on apparent evidence of atrocities provided by the RSF fighters themselves.\n\nThey have been sharing gruesome videos reportedly showing summary executions of mostly male civilians and ex-combatants, celebrating over dead bodies, and taunting and abusing people.\n\nAccounts from exhausted survivors also paint a picture of terror and violence.\n\n\"The situation in el-Fasher is extremely dire and there are violations taking place on the roads, including looting and shooting, with no distinction made between young or old,\" one man told the BBC Arabic service. He had escaped to the town of Tawila, a hub for those displaced from el-Fasher.\n\nAnother woman, Ikram Abdelhameed, told the Reuters news agency that RSF soldiers separated fleeing civilians at an earthen barrier around the city and shot the men.\n\nAnd  satellite images collected by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab  show evidence of what seem to be massacre sites – clusters of bodies and reddish patches on the earth that the analysts believe could be blood stains.\n\nEl-Fasher \"appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of… indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution\", the Yale researchers say in a report.\n\nThere is a clear ethnic element to the battle for el-Fasher, because local armed groups from the dominant Zaghawa tribe, known as the Joint Force, have been fighting alongside the army.\n\nThe RSF fighters see Zaghawa civilians as legitimate targets.\n\nThat is what many survivors of the paramilitary takeover of the Zamzam displaced persons camp next to el-Fasher reported earlier this year, according to an investigation by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF).\n\nThe army has also been accused of targeting ethnic groups it sees as support bases for the RSF in areas it has recaptured, including the states of Sennar, Gezira and some parts of North Kordofan.\n\n\"Whether you're a civilian, wherever you are, it is not safe right now, even in Khartoum,\" says Emi Mahmoud, strategic director of the IDP Humanitarian Network which helps coordinate aid deliveries in Darfur.\n\n\"Because at the flip of a hat, the people in power who have the guns, they can and will continue to falsely imprison, disappear, kill, torture, everyone.\"\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes - ethnically motivated revenge attacks are part of that.\n\nIt was Sudan's military government in 2003 that weaponised ethnicity – enlisting the Janjaweed to put down rebellions by black African groups in Darfur who accused Khartoum of politically and economically marginalising them.\n\nThe pattern of violence established then has been repeated in Darfur now, says Kate Ferguson, the co-founder of NGO Protection Approaches.\n\nThis was most evident in the 2023 massacre of members of the Masalit tribe in el-Geneina in West Darfur, which the UN says killed up to 15,000 people.\n\n\"For more than two years, the RSF have followed a very clear, practiced and predicted pattern,\" Ms Ferguson said at a press briefing.\n\n\"They first encircle their target town or city, they weaken it by cutting off access to food, to medicine, to power supplies, the internet. Then when it's weakened, they overwhelm the population with systematic arson, sexual violence, massacre and the destruction of vital infrastructure. This is a deliberate strategy to destroy and displace, and that's why I feel the appropriate word is genocide.\"\n\nThe RSF has denied involvement in what it has called \"tribal conflicts\", but Gen Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, appeared to be hearing expressions of mounting international outrage, including from the UN, the African Union, the European Union and the UK.\n\nHe released a video saying he was sorry for the disaster that had befallen the people of el-Fasher in a war that had been \"forced upon us\" and admitted there had been violations by his forces, promising they would be investigated by a committee that has now arrived in the city.\n\nAny \"soldier or any officer who committed a crime or crossed the lines against any person… will be immediately arrested and the result [of the investigation] to be announced immediately and in public in front of everyone,\" the general pledged.\n\nHowever, observers have noted that similar promises made in the past - in response to the accusations over el-Geneina, and alleged atrocities during the group's control of the central state of Gezira - were never fulfilled\n\nIt is also not clear how much control the RSF leadership has over its foot soldiers – a loose mix of hired militias, allied Arab groups, and regional mercenaries, many from Chad and South Sudan.\n\n\"The reality is that the way that the RSF is, it's very, very hard to believe that a command is going to be given by Hemedti, and then people on the ground are going to follow it,\" says aid co-ordinator Ms Mahmoud. \"By that time, we'll have lost many, many people.\"\n\nAid groups and activists warn that if the pattern of the past two years is allowed to continue, it could happen again. They stress that the el-Fasher killings were entirely predictable, but the international community failed to act to protect civilians despite ample warning.\n\n\"The reality is that we laid these options out multiple times over six meetings with UN Security Council elements, with the US government, with the British government, with the French government, basically saying they had to be ready for a protection kinetic option [direct military action] in the summer of last year,\" says Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab.\n\n\"This cannot be something settled by a press conference. It has to be something settled by immediate action.\"\n\nIn particular, activists are urging pressure on the United Arab Emirates, which is widely accused of providing military support to the RSF. The UAE denies this despite evidence presented in UN reports and international media investigations.\n\n\"This is exactly like the siege of Sarajevo,\" says Ms Mahmoud, referring to the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnia war, which galvanised international action. \"This is the Srebrenica moment.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7m0n890npo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"03:50:18.613+00:00","title":"Who is Rob Jetten, tipped to become youngest Dutch prime minister?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rob Jetten, a 38-year-old leader of the socially liberal D66 party, is emerging as a strong contender to become the youngest prime minister of the Netherlands following a dramatic rise in popularity after a poor 2023 election performance.

2025-10-30T03:50:18.613+00:00\n\nTitle: Who is Rob Jetten, tipped to become youngest Dutch prime minister?\n\nRob Jetten's achievement in dragging his socially liberal D66 party from fifth place to the top of Dutch politics in less than two years has been extraordinary.\n\nBut politically, all the stars were perfectly aligned for the 38-year-old to do so.\n\nThe result of Wednesday's election is too close to call, with Jetten vying with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders for the most seats in parliament.\n\nNo other political leader commanded as much screen time during the campaign as Jetten and his smile and cheerful message resonated with voters, while his rivals sometimes struggled.\n\nHardly a night went by without him on TV. When Wilders cancelled an appearance because of security fears, Rob Jetten seized the moment and took his place. He even featured in a TV quiz show recorded months ago called The Smartest Person.\n\nAnd his D66 party was untarnished by involvement in Wilders' ill-fated 11-month coalition, largely because Jetten had fared so poorly in the last election in 2023. The government collapsed last June when  Wilders' party quit following a row over migration .\n\nBut perhaps more than anything else, he was able to convey a positive message summed up by the slogan  Het kan wel  - an optimistic phrase that borrows from Barack Obama's \"Yes, we can\".\n\nIt contrasted strongly with Wilders, who he accused of \"sowing division\".\n\nIf his party does come top, Rob Jetten could become the Netherlands' first openly gay prime minister.\n\nA self-confessed politics nerd as a child, the young Jetten grew up in a small town in the southern province of Brabant and came out when he was young.\n\nJetten has not made his private life part of his political identity, but five years ago he posted a video in which he read out a long list of homophobic messages from his phone, to prove why an international day against homophobia was important.\n\nJetten is now engaged to Argentine hockey player, Nicolás Keenan, and they are due to marry next year.\n\nHe was an early supporter of the centrist D66, which describes itself as progressive and socially liberal party, and officials soon spotted his potential.\n\nAfter a few years working for Dutch rail network ProRail, Jetten was elected as an MP in 2017 and had a couple of early experiences as leader before he served under long-serving prime minister Mark Rutte as climate minister.\n\nBut not everything has worked out smoothly in Jetten's career.\n\nA parliamentary colleague complained he was \"pushy\" on the climate, and his big ambitions as minister were cut short when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.\n\nHe led D66's disastrous campaign in 2023 when the party came away with only nine seats, two years after his predecessor Sigrid Kaag managed second place after Rutte.\n\nJetten was not yet as fluent in front of the cameras. Some media appearances he gave were criticised as dull, and one critic labelled him \"Robot Jetten\".\n\n\"Robot Jetten is going to be prime minister!\" one reporter said to him incredulously as his success became clear on Wednesday night.\n\n\"Sometimes it can work out really crazy in politics,\" Jetten replied with a broad grin.\n\nSupporters see him as a kind of mini-Mark Rutte, who is now head of Nato.\n\nAnd that comparison will suit Jetten fine, as many Dutch now look back warmly on the stability of the Rutte years, after two years of relative turmoil.\n\nBoth men always appear cheerful and pragmatic, and both are notorious for getting by on precious little sleep.\n\nHowever, party colleague Roy Kramer noticed a difference: \"Rutte is a chatterbox, Jetten is a bit quieter,\" he told Dutch newspaper Het Parool.\n\nThe liberal leader has big ambitions, and few challenges are more pressing than tackling the Netherlands' housing crisis, with a shortage of some 400,000 homes.\n\nJetten wants to build 10 cities and complains Dutch governments have not really achieved anything impressive for the past 10 to 15 years. He is making big promises and will come under pressure to deliver.\n\nFor Jetten to succeed he will need some of Rutte's teflon political coating that saw him through four governments.\n\nHe has already survived one awkward moment in the campaign, when a joke about Crown Princess Amalia fell flat in front of 2,000 students in Rotterdam.\n\n\"I think the best way of promoting work in the military is being able to end up training with the Crown Princess. I bet a few guys in this audience would be interested in that,\" he said.\n\nThe debate moderator hit back saying: \"what kind of sexist remark is that?\"\n\nJetten later admitted it was inappropriate, but it appears to have done him no harm."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyndvj3640o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"02:10:16.850+00:00","title":"Daughter criticises Australia cruise operator after mother dies on island","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The daughter of Suzanne Rees, an 80-year-old woman who died on Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef after being left behind during a cruise departure, has accused the Coral Expeditions operator of a 'failure of care and common sense'.

her with it as he was the parent who happened to be at home.\n\nChatting about periods with young people can be awkward, even more so if you don't experience them yourself, but Helen says her dad had always spoken openly about what to expect which made that first time much easier.\n\nDads \"can't tell you how it actually feels or how it can affect your life sometimes, but they can still provide advice and talk about it,\" she says.\n\nYet talking about periods can still feel like uncomfortable for many and even today, it's often left to mothers to handle.\n\nHelen's father John Adams is one of a growing number of dads who are challenging the unfounded stigma.\n\nJohn was a stay-at-home parent when his two daughters - now 16 and 12 - were younger, and said some parents he'd spoken to felt too uncomfortable to talk to their kids about periods.\n\n\"They were waiting for them to learn about it at school, but I don't believe it's just a teacher's job to talk about this.\"\n\nJohn spoke to both daughters about what they might experience, the level of pain they could be in and the various sanitary product options.\n\n\"Men maybe blunder in but they go in without that baggage and just sort of talk about things practically,\" he tells  BBC Radio 5 Live's Time of the Month .\n\nJohn, who now works in education, admits he's no expert but he spoke to his wife and mother about it and used books and online resources to guide him.\n\nFor him, periods are a matter of health, not embarrassment and while the idea of dads discussing menstruation still divides opinion, John says it's important to \"be there and approachable for your children\".\n\nAs a widowed father, Roy had no choice. He has been raising his daughter alone after his wife died from cancer.\n\nHe started talking about periods when she was nine, by going through some books with her about what to expect.\n\n\"Initially the colour drained from her face, but we spoke about it openly.\"\n\nLater, he showed his daughter a pad and demonstrated how she should stick it onto her pants and suggested she have a test drive of one.\n\n\"Things are scary when you don't know what's going on.\n\n\"I'm preparing my daughter for life and part of that is periods, sex, boyfriends, relationships. It's all difficult but you can't hide from it.\"\n\nFor many women, the memory of their first period is far less open.\n\nHannah Routledge, who works for the not-for-profit group Hey Girls, which works to stop period poverty, remembers hers with discomfort.\n\n\"I started my periods really young. I was only 10,\" she says. \"I went to a school that had no provision, no bins even.\"\n\nHey Girls launched its Pads for Dads campaign in 2019, offering free guidance and resources to help fathers have those early talks.\n\n\"It was designed to break the stigma around periods for dads and parents in general,\" she explains. \"Don't wait for a big conversation, it's about having lots of smaller ones, making sure you've got products in the house and just being supportive.\"\n\nHannah says it's also essential parents talk to their sons about periods to make them aware.\n\nDr Nighat Arif, a GP who specialises in women's health, started talking to her six-year-old son when he found one of her tampons in the bathroom.\n\n\"I said 'This is something that mummy uses because she bleeds'\".  Initially, this made him anxious, but she told him it was normal and happened to all women every month.\n\nHannah says attitudes are changing fast and has even noticed a shift in her own dad who would have once avoided period conversations but now \"if his granddaughters needed something or wanted to have that conversation, I think he'd be much more open\".\n\nConsultant gynaecologist Dr Christine Ekechi, who works in the NHS, says there's often a double standard when it comes to parents talking to their children about puberty.\n\n\"There are so many single mothers with sons and we don't tell them they cannot talk to their sons about puberty and adolescence and about protective sex.\n\n\"So why do we still have this hang up if it's the other way around?\"\n\nAn increase in openness at home also has wider effects and Dr Ekechi believes informed fathers make better colleagues and leaders too.\n\nThis can help reduce period stigma in the workplace and improve menstrual equity at work.\n\nAbove all though, \"it's a fantastic way to improve a bond between a father and a daughter,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykqrlwwxqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"00:17:40.994+00:00","title":"Should K-beauty products have to come from South Korea?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The global popularity of K-beauty, a skincare trend originating in South Korea, has led to a surge in exports and international brands adopting Korean-inspired products.

the world.\n\nBut as exports from South Korea  hit $10.3bn (£7.7bn) last year,  cosmetics companies in other countries have introduced their own K-beauty ranges that are not Korean-made.\n\nDoes this blurring of the definition matter?\n\nK-beauty products first came to international attention in the 2010s, part of a wave of other Korean exports, such as K-pop and K-drama.\n\nThe K-beauty skincare regime can be very elaborate, involving as many as 10 different steps, each requiring a separate product. This caught the imagination of people around the world, and sales rose sharply.\n\nAnnual exports from South Korea increased from $650m in 2011 to $4bn in 2017, according to official figures, a sixfold rise in just six years.\n\nRecognising this huge jump in demand, cosmetics brand Seoul Ceuticals was launched in 2017, named after the South Korean capital.\n\n\"We started to see this increase in growth in interest in K-beauty, and began developing a skincare brand to meet that demand… when we really saw it emerging in the US,\" says Seoul Ceuticals' director of retail relationship Ann Majeski.\n\n\"It has been extremely successful. We expect to do over $14m in sales in 2025. We've seen a global acceptance and demand for the K-beauty products. We've started selling in India, Latin America, Europe and Australia.\"\n\nBut Seoul Ceuticals is not a Korean company. It is based in the US, where it also manufacturers all its products.\n\nThe business doesn't claim to be Korean, but it does say that it makes  \"real, authentic Korean skincare\".\n\nThat may sound like a contradiction, but the company says it isn't because its ingredients are sourced from South Korea.\n\n\"I think we were a little more sensitive about it when we were first starting, because we wanted to be very transparent that the products are made in the US,\" says Ms Majeski.\n\n\"[But] we source our ingredients in Korea… we wanted to be able to legitimately say we are a K-beauty brand.\"\n\nBut not everyone would agree with this.\n\n\"The products should be manufactured by a Korean manufacturer,\" says Seung Gu Kim, co-founder of K-beauty cosmetics firm Hwarangpoom.\n\nHe runs the business with his wife Elisa Ahonpää-Kim. While they are based in Finland, all of their team except Elisa are Korean, and all their products are made in South Korea.\n\n\"The most important thing that we both absolutely agree is that the brand should develop its concept, and ideas, and products with a Korean perspective,\" says Mr Gu Kim.\n\n\"That can come through in the ingredients, the design. Or cultural elements, basically anything that clearly connects to the brands to Korea, or at least reflects a Korean influence.\"\n\nHowever, the couple do admit that the definition of K-beauty remains complex.\n\n\"I guess it's a very vague concept, because on the market you will find a lot of brands that are made by Koreans who live abroad,\" says Ms Ahonpää-Kim.\n\n\"And then brands like Lancôme and Clinique manufacture their products in Korea and Japan, but then it doesn't make those brands Japanese and Korean.\"\n\nThere is currently no official definition of K-beauty. And there is no protected designation of origin to defend it, like in the case of Champagne or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.\n\nAnd there is no plan to set one up, according to the K-beauty Industry Association, the only K-beauty trade body officially approved by the South Korean government.\n\n\"We are currently more focused in promoting and expanding K-beauty,\" says the organisation's chairman Chang Nam Jang.\n\n\"While the trend is quite established in Asia, it is only just starting in Europe and the US, and we don't want to throttle the growth by imposing any sanctions on them.\"\n\nHowever, the association does have rules for its members – they must be companies that are registered in South Korea, and their products must be officially tested and approved by Korea Food & Drug Administration. That approval is required in order to sell inside South Korea.\n\n\"If a product is developed in a way that suits the climate and environment of Korea, and is recognized as a viable product in the Korean market, then we would acknowledge it as K-beauty,\" says Mr Nam Jang.\n\nHwarangpoom agrees with this definition, and has received approval from KFDA.  And Seoul Ceuticals has also started the process to attain KFDA approval, to bring their products to Korean consumers.\n\nWith K-beauty exports from South Korea in 2024  20% higher than in 2023,  there is a lot of money to be made in the sector whether the firms are homegrown or not.\n\nIn fact, South Korea is now the largest exporter of cosmetic products after France and the US.\n\nHowever, this success has spawned counterfeiters.\n\nMark Lee is the CEO of MarqVision, a US-based business helps firms spot fakes and get them removed from sale.\n\n\"For a major Korean beauty brand, which I cannot disclose, we recently conducted 29 test purchases across major US marketplaces,\" he says. \"Twenty six of them were fake. So that's a 90% counterfeit rate.\"\n\nAnd in 2024 as a whole, Marqvision identified $280m worth of fake K-beauty products in the US market alone.\n\nThe high number of counterfeits greatly frustrated K-beauty fan Gracie Tullio. \"Shopping online for K-beauty was a really scary experience,\" she says.\n\nThis led to London-based Ms Tullio launching PureSeoul in 2019, a K-beauty retail business that sells authentic products sourced directly from Korean manufacturers.\n\nShe says she gets customers who visit the shop with suspected fake products to check if they are real.\n\n\"Even our customers can be sometimes tempted by the lower price [of online fakes]. It's so tempting for them just to give it a go and see, and nine times out of 10, it's not real,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0kvrnyy4wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"03:08:23.314+00:00","title":"First deaths from Hurricane Melissa confirmed in Jamaica and Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm in Jamaica and later a Category 3 storm in Cuba, caused widespread devastation across the Caribbean, with at least 25 confirmed deaths—five in Jamaica and 20 in Haiti—alongside catastrophic flooding, destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss of power.

Haiti\n\nHurricane Melissa has continued its devastating sweep across the Caribbean, destroying homes and infrastructure, flooding neighbourhoods and leaving dozens dead.\n\nThe impact in Jamaica was clearer on Wednesday, after the island nation was hit squarely by the category five storm - one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the region. At least five people have been confirmed dead there.\n\nAt least another 20 died during flooding in Haiti as Melissa, now a category two storm, tore through the region.\n\nIn Jamaica, people remain stranded on roofs and without power. Prime Minister Andrew Holness noted the \"total devastation\" across the island-nation.\n\nHe added that \"80-90% of roofs were destroyed\", along with hospitals, libraries, police stations, port houses and other urban infrastructure.\n\nKing Charles, who is the head of state in Jamaica, said in a statement that he was \"deeply concerned\" and \"profoundly saddened\" at the damage caused by Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean.\n\n\"This most dreadful of record-breaking storms reminds us of the increasingly urgent need to restore the balance and harmony of Nature for the sake of all those whose lives and livelihoods may have been shattered by this heartbreaking disaster,\" he said.\n\nFrom Jamaica, where the storm also  caused mudslides, and palm trees to be tossed like toothpicks , Melissa moved north to Cuba as a category three storm, bringing  115 mph winds and heavy rain, and battering the south-east of the island.\n\nRovier Mesa Rodríguez, a video maker who lives in Santiago de Cuba, called the storm \"terrifying\" and described it sounding \"like a tornado\".\n\nCuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel asked residents to \"not let their guard down\" and said that the country had prepared for a worst-case scenario, which helped its response.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the storm was 105 miles (170km) from the central Bahamas and expected to reach the Bahamas region overnight. Hurricane Melissa was moving north-east with wind speeds at 100 mph (155 km/h).  A dangerous storm surge is expected there before it moves further north toward Bermuda.\n\nA tropical storm warning is in place for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the speed of the slow-moving hurricane is expected to increase in the coming days.\n\nIn Jamaica, three men and a woman were confirmed dead. They were discovered after being washed up by the flood waters in the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of Local Government and Community Development.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the country lost electricity overnight.\n\nRichard Vernon, mayor of Montego Bay, told the BBC that half of the city had been cut off from the other by floods. He said the priority was to \"check if everybody is alive\".\n\nA resident in St Elizabeth sheltering in her four-bedroom home described the moment her roof blew off.\n\nGordon Swaby, a businessman in Kingston, told the BBC that his first cousin's house was completely destroyed. His cousin - who he declined to be named - recently moved from the United States to her \"dream\" house by the sea in the upscale Crane Road area. She lost the entire concrete structure and everything in it.\n\n\"She wanted a different kind of life,\" Gordon said. \"She chose the area because she loves the sea, so this is really devastating.\"\n\nDevastation was evident on Wednesday across central Jamaica. The city of Mandeville was flattened and the main road through town was littered with debris.\n\nFoliage was stuck to everything, and bits of building material were scattered along the road. The clean-up is expected to take months.\n\nPia Chevallier, who is on holiday in Jamaica, said she felt \"sick with worry\" during the storm overnight. \"The windows didn't stop vibrating.\"\n\nIn Haiti, at least 20 people - including 10 children -  died in river floods , local authorities told AFP news agency.\n\nThe island, which the country shares with the Dominican Republic, was struck by catastrophic flash flooding and landslides, which forced 3,000 people into shelters.\n\n\"Many homes have been washed away on the coast,\" said Pascal Bimenyimana from the Christian NGO, World Relief, in Port-au-Prince. Structures also lost their roofing and people were clearing the debris with their bare hands, he said.\n\nTorrential winds, violent rain and flooding destroyed crops across the country's south.\n\nThe US is sending a disaster response team to Jamaica to assess the scale of need in the hurricane's aftermath. Formal requests for help came from Haiti and The Bahamas, according to senior State Department officials.\n\nThe assistance comes in the wake of the Trump administration's closure of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was the world's biggest aid agency, amid cuts to foreign assistance by billions of dollars.\n\nMelissa is not expected to make landfall in North America, but will still be a formidable extratropical cyclone when it nears St Johns, Newfoundland, in Canada on Friday night."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91jnyelq2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:45:35.818+00:00","title":"Five new suspects arrested over Louvre jewellery theft","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the brazen 19 October heist at the Louvre museum, where €88 million worth of jewels were stolen during broad daylight.

theft\n\nFive   more suspects have been arrested over their involvement in the Louvre heist, Paris' public prosecutor has said.\n\nThey were detained on Wednesday night in the Paris region during coordinated raids, according to Laure Beccuau.\n\nOne of the suspects is thought to be part of the four-man team that carried out the heist, who were seen on CCTV.\n\nTwo of the other alleged thieves have already been arrested and have  \"partially recognised\" their involvement  in the brazen theft, while the fourth person has not yet been caught.\n\nIt is not clear what role the other newly arrested people allegedly played in the theft but, Beccuau told French radio station RTL on Thursday that they \"may eventually inform us about how the incident took place\".\n\nBeccuau said the arrests had been made in areas in and around Paris, including the  suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.\n\nPhones and other objects found on the suspects during the raid were allowing investigators to study encrypted messages, she added.\n\nThose arrested can be detained for up to four days before being charged or released.\n\nFrench investigators are not giving many more details away at this stage but Beccuau said that DNA from one of those arrested on Wednesday night could be linked to the crime scene.\n\n\"We had him in our sights,\" she said of the main suspect.\n\nShe specified that the latest arrests were not related to statements made by the previously detained suspects but to \"other elements of the case\".\n\nThe authorities have previously said that the gang involved in the heist could be bigger than those who physically stole the jewels.\n\nItems worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the Louvre - the world's most-visited museum - on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight. The precious jewels have not been recovered yet.\n\nThe first two people who were arrested over the heist - both men in their thirties with criminal records - are thought to be the pair who used power tools to enter the museum's  Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) and steal some of the French crown jewels.\n\nThey were taken into custody late last week. Beccuau told a press conference on Wednesday that one of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but that the other man had not been planning to leave France, contrary to earlier media reports.\n\nThere was no evidence at this stage to suggest the theft was an inside job, she added, confirming no accomplices worked at the museum.\n\nOn the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30, just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Gallery of Apollo via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.\n\nBeccuau said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east. Nobody had been threatened during the raid.\n\nFrance's justice minister said security protocols in the Louvre - one of the world's most famous museums - \"failed\" in preventing the theft.\n\nIt was later revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Gallery of Apollo was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in.\n\nSince the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.\n\nThe Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/politics/trump-nuclear-weapons-testing.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"02:03:58.967Z","title":"Trump Threatens to Resume Nuclear Weapons Testing, Minutes Before Xi Meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a highly charged diplomatic moment, former President Donald Trump threatened to resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in 33 years, just minutes before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

years\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called on US military leaders to resume testing nuclear weapons in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\n\n\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" he wrote on social media just before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.\n\nThe US has more nuclear weapons than any other country, Trump said, with Russia second and China a \"distant third\". It has not conducted nuclear testing since 1992.\n\nIt comes just days after Trump denounced Russia for testing a nuclear-powered missile. The Kremlin says its tests were \"not nuclear\".\n\nLater, on Air Force One after the two leaders' meeting, Trump said the nuclear test sites would be determined later.\n\n\"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said on his way back to Washington.\n\nNo country except North Korea has conducted a nuclear test explosion in this century, according to the Arms Control Association (ACA) - and even Pyongyang announced a moratorium in 2018.\n\nTrump's announcement did not make it clear whether he was referring to testing a nuclear explosion, or simply a weapon system that would be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.\n\nHis post on Wednesday night acknowledged the \"tremendous destructive power\" of nuclear weapons, but said he had \"no choice\" but to update and renovate the US arsenal during his first term in office.\n\nHe also said that China's nuclear programme \"will be even within 5 years\".\n\nThe announcement marks an apparent reversal of a long-standing US policy. The last US nuclear weapons test was in 1992, before former Republican President George HW Bush issued a moratorium as the Cold War ended.\n\nRussia announced over the weekend that it had successfully tested two new weapons capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\n\nThese included a missile which the Kremlin said could penetrate US defence systems, and an underwater drone called Poseidon, capable of hitting the American west coast and triggering radioactive ocean swells. But those tests did not involve the detonation of nuclear weapons.\n\nOn Thursday, Russia denied it had carried out nuclear tests.\n\n\"Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. \"This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.\"\n\nThe Kremlin said the United States had not notified Russia of its intention to conduct nuclear weapons testing.\n\n\"The US is a sovereign country which has a right to make its sovereign decisions. But I want to recall President Putin's statement, which has been repeated many times: if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,\" the spokesman said.\n\nChina has also responded to Trump's announcement, saying it hoped the US would earnestly fulfil its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and honour its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\n\nTrump has said the US has more nuclear weapons than any other country.\n\nThe exact number of warheads held by each country is kept secret in each case - but Russia is thought to have a total of about 5,459 warheads while the US has about 5,177, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).\n\nThe US-based ACA gives slightly higher estimates, saying America's nuclear stockpile sits at about 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580.\n\nChina is the third largest nuclear power with about 600 warheads, France has 290, the United Kingdom 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel 90 and North Korea 50, FAS reports.\n\nAccording to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030.\n\nTrump's statement about nuclear testing came about 100 days before the expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start) in February 2026 - the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia.\n\nThe agreement limits each country to 1,550 warheads on deployed missiles capable of crossing continents.\n\nThe last time the US tested a nuclear bomb was 23 September 1992. The test took place at an underground facility in the western state of Nevada.\n\nThe project, code named Divider,  was the 1,054th nuclear weapons test conducted by the US, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which played a central role in helping develop the world's first atomic bomb.\n\nThe Nevada Test Site, 65 miles (105km) north of Las Vegas, is still operated by the US government.\n\n\"If deemed necessary, the site could be authorised again for nuclear weapons testing,\" according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, which is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nBut some experts note that it would take the US at least 36 months to restart underground nuclear tests at the former Nevada test site.\n\n\"Trump is misinformed and out of touch,\" Daryl G Kimball, executive director of the ACA, wrote on X. \"The US has no technical, military, or political justification for resuming nuclear explosive testing for the first time since 1992.\"\n\n\"Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all US allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by US adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, \" Mr Kimball added.\n\nTrump's announcement also drew negative reactions from a few opposition Democrats. Representative Dina Titus, from Nevada, wrote on X: \"I'll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this.\"\n\nThe US first marched into the nuclear era with the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.\n\nIt later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year during World War Two.\n\nApproximately  140,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and 74,000 in Nagasaki,  with many deaths occurring from immediate blast effects, burns, and later from radiation sickness."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgk4x5ze3mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:06:00.632+00:00","title":"Can the Gaza ceasefire deal survive?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is under intense strain after Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip killed over 100 people—mostly women and children—in residential and humanitarian areas, following claims that Hamas fighters opened fire in Rafah.

2025-10-29T19:06:00.632+00:00\n\nTitle: Can the Gaza ceasefire deal survive?\n\nWhen is a ceasefire no longer a ceasefire? It depends on who you ask.\n\nAccording to US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, \"nothing is going to jeopardise\" the truce between Israel and Hamas that his administration has worked so hard to secure, along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nBut with more than 100 people reportedly killed by Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip late on Tuesday, preceded by Israel's accusations that Hamas fighters opened fire on its soldiers in Rafah, killing one of them and violating the terms of the deal, this is stretching the definition of \"ceasefire\" beyond credulity.\n\nIsrael says it struck multiple \"terror targets and terrorists\". The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency in Gaza reports that most of those killed were women and children, and that the air strikes hit residential areas, schools and tents housing displaced families.\n\nVolker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called the deaths \"appalling\" and called on Israel to comply with international humanitarian law.\n\nUltimately, the survivability of the much-vaunted ceasefire deal, as well as the wider, 20-point Trump peace plan for Gaza, depends heavily on the continuing engagement of the current White House.\n\nTrump, his Vice-President JD Vance, his special envoy Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have all been here to Israel this month.\n\nThey have all invested a large amount of time and effort in stopping the carnage in Gaza and they all have something to lose if their efforts fail.\n\nIn practice, this means several things.\n\nWhile the US publicly acknowledges Israel's right to respond to attacks that it ascribes to Hamas, in private US officials have been urging restraint in order to keep this deal alive.\n\nAfter the first major challenge to the ceasefire on 19 October, when Israel said Hamas fighters had shot dead two of its soldiers and its retaliatory strikes killed more than 40 Palestinians, it was Washington that made Israel reopen border crossings to let in aid and it was US pressure that prevented an even harsher Israeli response.\n\nNow that Hamas has returned the 20 living hostages it was holding, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, there are some on the far-right in Israel, including in the cabinet, who have been urging the government to resume the full-scale war on Hamas.\n\nThe White House is unlikely to let that happen, but it is clearly allowing Israel some leeway to respond to apparent violations by Hamas.\n\nSo far, Hamas, while strongly condemning the Israeli air strikes, is still insisting it is abiding by the terms of the deal.\n\n\"Hamas accepted the ceasefire because it seemed the least bad choice open to them, especially as President Trump is invested personally and might act as an effective brake on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu,\" says Tahani Mustafa, lecturer on international relations at King's College London.\n\nBut if violence such as what occurred on Tuesday becomes the norm, then the ceasefire will exist in name only.\n\nAlthough the US is the big heavyweight behind this deal, Egypt and Qatar are in many ways just as important.\n\nQatar has long hosted Hamas leaders as well as - since the group's attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 that sparked the war - round after round of peace talks involving the CIA and Mossad, Israel's overseas intelligence agency.\n\nTellingly, despite the renewed bloodshed in Gaza, the Qatari Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani, told a US audience on Wednesday: \"Fortunately, I think the main parties - both of them [Israel and Hamas] - are acknowledging that the ceasefire should hold and they should stick to the agreement.\"\n\nDr Robert Pinfold, lecturer in Defence Studies at King's College London, is of a similar opinion.\n\n\"The ceasefire will likely survive,\" he told the BBC. \"Israel and Hamas both perceive that the costs of abrogating the ceasefire themselves are too high.\"\n\nBut when it comes to moving on beyond phase one of the Trump plan for Gaza, he is less optimistic.\n\n\"What has been set back is any meaningful transition to somewhere better, such as Gaza's rehabilitation and rebuilding. Whilst the ceasefire may survive, it will remain on tenterhooks,\" he said.\n\n\"Any prospect of 'peace' or rebuilding Gaza is as remote as ever.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly91q251ljo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:40:53.893+00:00","title":"Lily Allen to tour West End Girl album in UK theatres","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lily Allen is announcing a UK tour in March 2026 to perform her new album 'West End Girl' in full, inspired by her experience starring in the West End play 2:22 - A Ghost Story, which she claims triggered the emotional and marital changes leading to her separation from US actor David Harbour.

A Ghost Story when it opened in the West End shortly after the pandemic.\n\nThis period is what inspired the title of the album, West End Girl, and Allen appears to sing about how being cast the play sparked the chain of events that led to her separation from Harbour.\n\nIn interviews, Allen has stressed the lyrics aren't necessarily the gospel truth - because she \"wasn't sure what was real, and what was in my head\" as she processed the end of the relationship.\n\nThe album's lyrics, as well as interviews she gave at the time, suggest that Harbour was surprised and envious that Allen had secured a leading West End role without having to audition, and that his \"demeanour started to change\" after she was cast.\n\nShe sings that starring in 2:22 led to a distance developing between the couple, both literally and metaphorically, which resulted in Harbour suggesting an open relationship.\n\nAllen sings on the record about how this led to an \"arrangement\" with Harbour where he could be with other women, but the rules were \"there had to be payment, it had to be with strangers\".\n\nBut, before long, Allen hears of a relationship her husband appears to have with \"Madeline\" - a pseudonym - which falls outside their arrangement.\n\nHarbour has not publicly commented on the content of the album.\n\nHowever, he appears to still have a relationship with Allen and her children,  and was seen  taking her daughters to a theme park last weekend.\n\nAll 14 songs on West End Girl were written by Allen, mainly in collaboration with her musical director Blue May.\n\nAllen has suggested that some of the songs are written \"in character\", saying that the lyrics \"could be considered autofiction\" - a genre that combines autobiography and fiction.\n\nShe rose to fame in 2006 with her debut album Alright, Still, and had number one hits including Smile, The Fear, and her cover of Keane's Somewhere Only We Know, which was featured in a John Lewis advert.\n\nShe had two number one albums in the UK, It's Not Me It's You and Sheezus, while her 2018 record No Shame was nominated for the Mercury Prize.\n\nShe released a candid memoir, My Thoughts Exactly, in the same year, but took a break from music shortly afterwards, and began dating Harbour in 2019.\n\nThe singer will perform West End Girl in the order the songs appear on the record for her tour in March.\n\nTickets for the tour, which launches in March 2026, go on sale on 7 November."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/asia/china-trump-xi-trade.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:00:06-04:00","title":"The Art of Letting Trump Claim a Win, While Walking Away Stronger","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a meeting in Busan, South Korea, President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump reached a temporary truce in their trade dispute, with China securing key concessions through its control of rare earths and purchases of U.S. soybeans.

Both sides also agreed to extend a truce struck earlier this year to limit tariffs.\n\n“What’s clear is they have become increasingly bold in exerting leverage and they are happy to pocket any and all U.S. concessions,” said Julian Gewirtz, who was a senior China policy official at the White House and the State Department in President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration.\n\nSounding almost like he was delivering a lecture, Mr. Xi said to Mr. Trump that the “recent twists and turns” of the trade war should be instructive to them both, according to a Chinese government summary of Mr. Xi’s remarks at the meeting in Busan, South Korea.\n\n“Both sides should consider the bigger picture and focus on the long-term benefits of cooperation, rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” Mr. Xi said.\n\nBy twists and turns Mr. Xi was likely referring to the last several months, or nearly a year, of tit-for-tat retaliatory measures in the form of tariffs, sanctions and export controls. Earlier this month, China escalated dramatically, strengthening its hand by announcing sweeping new limits on the sales of on rare earths, critical minerals that are needed for almost all modern technology. Cutting off their supply could cripple U.S. industries.\n\nMr. Xi’s message seemed to be: Beijing had proven its capacity to hit back and Washington would do well to remember it.\n\n“After Trump launched his trade and tariff war, China was the only country that matched the United States blow for blow,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University, noting that the biggest win for China could be that the United States might think twice before imposing new measures on China.\n\n“If Trump had forced China to implement its complete export controls on rare earths, it would have been a lose-lose situation for both sides,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Xi also seemed to grasp what Mr. Trump needed, a deal that he could sell as a victory at home. The outcome allowed Mr. Trump to claim a win for American farmers and companies, even though China had largely restored the status quo by agreeing to buy soybeans and to hold off on further restricting the export of rare earths.\n\nMr. Trump pumped a fist in the air as he boarded Air Force One, then said on the plane that Mr. Xi had agreed to take more action to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl from reaching the United States. He also said that China promised to purchase more U.S. soybeans. “Our Farmers will be very happy!” he posted on Truth Social afterward. “I would like to thank President Xi for this!”\n\nAfter the two leaders met, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that it would suspend for one year the restrictions on rare earths that were announced in October. (The ministry made no mention of earlier controls announced in April.)\n\nSeparately, Mr. Trump said he would cut in half the 20 percent tariffs he had imposed on Chinese goods to pressure China to do more to stop fentanyl trafficking. The reduction announced on Thursday brings overall tariffs on Chinese goods to around 47 percent from 57 percent, he said. The Chinese commerce ministry also said the two sides had agreed to a one-year extension of a truce to limit additional tariffs that was originally set to expire on Nov. 10.\n\nSome experts said China inevitably had the upper hand in the trade fight because the Trump administration never had a clear objective.\n\n“I think its an approach that can safely be described as tactics without a strategy,” said Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously analyzed Chinese politics at the C.I.A.\n\n“Ostensibly, the goal was to address some of the meaty trade issues that had long bedeviled the relationship. Instead, the P.R.C. side has successfully orchestrated a game of ‘whack-a-mole’ for the Trump Administration,” Mr. Czin said, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China.\n\nStill, in a potential concession by Beijing, China’s official summary of the meeting did not mention Taiwan, the island democracy that Beijing claims. It is a topic that Chinese leaders usually bring up when meeting their U.S. counterparts to pressure Washington to dial back U.S. support for the island.\n\nThe agreements struck on Thursday could mean at least a temporary calm in the fractious U.S.-China relationship. Mr. Trump said the two leaders also discussed “working together” to end the war in Ukraine. He said he would travel to China in April and Mr. Xi would visit the United States after that.\n\nMr. Xi also played to Mr. Trump’s preference for personal rapport by appealing to Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda, saying that he believed China’s development “goes hand in hand” with the president’s “vision to ‘make America great again.’” Mr. Trump, for his part, flattered Mr. Xi, calling him “a great leader of a great country” and a “great friend.”\n\n“It’s a personalized style of diplomacy that plays well to both leaders’ instincts,” said Lizzi C. Lee, a fellow focusing on the Chinese economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “For now, these gestures of good will seem to set the tone for a period of managed stability.”\n\nStill, any progress made on Thursday could easily be erased by moves on either side that are interpreted as violating the agreement. A deal struck last month was almost undone when the U.S. expanded the range of companies banned from accessing U.S. technology, which would have affected many Chinese companies. China then announced its export controls on rare earths. That prompted Mr. Trump to threaten to call off Thursday’s meeting and to impose yet more tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nIn the absence of a finalized agreement, it is unclear how long the current détente will last.\n\n“Maybe I’m jaded because I’ve seen this movie too many times, but these are issues that are relatively easy to roll back and also to accuse the other side of bad faith,” said Ja Ian Chong, a professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, about the state of the truce.\n\nThursday’s progress threatened to be overshadowed by an announcement that Mr. Trump made just before the meeting. He said that the United States would resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in more than three decades. But Mr. Trump seemed to suggest on Air Force One that the move was not directed at China, and analysts said it was not clear that Mr. Xi would see it as a provocation.\n\nMore important, experts in China said, is that the American president is focused on working with China.\n\n“If Trump truly wants to implement something, if he wants to go east, his staff wouldn’t dare go west,” said Xin Qiang, a U.S.-China expert at Fudan University in Shanghai.\n\nPei-Lin Wu contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00.147+00:00","title":"Why has the US government shut down and what does it mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US government has shut down for the first time in nearly seven years due to a budget standoff between Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress.

2025-10-29T13:17:00.147+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has the US government shut down and what does it mean?\n\nThe US government shutdown continues, with Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress no closer to ending their budget standoff.\n\nIt means that many - but not all - US government services are   temporarily suspended, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.\n\nAlthough budget confrontations are common in US politics, this one is especially tense because President Donald Trump began drastically reducing the size of the national government as soon as he returned to office in January, and has threatened to use the current impasse to make further cuts.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats could not agree to pass a bill funding government services past 1 October, when the previous federal budget expired.\n\nIn the US system, Congress must agree a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nThe Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress. But in the Senate - or upper chamber - they are short of the 60 votes needed to pass the spending bill, which gives opposition Democrats some negotiating power.\n\nDemocrats want the bill to include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and a reversal of Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.\n\nDemocrats also oppose spending cuts to government health agencies.\n\nA stopgap bill designed to avoid the shutdown was passed in the House, or lower chamber, but did not clear the Senate.\n\nAnd so, at 00:01 EDT on 1 October (04:01 GMT), the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nEnding the shutdown requires the two parties in the Senate to find a compromise that Trump will sign. Several votes aimed at reopening the government have failed.\n\nRepublicans say they want to negotiate the health insurance subsidies separately, and only pass what they call a \"clean resolution\".  The Trump administration has been unwilling to offer substantive concessions and believes the Democrats will bear the brunt of the public's blame.\n\nOn the other side, Democrats believe their efforts to secure cheaper healthcare are popular with voters. There is also pressure on congressional leaders to hold firm from the party's left wing, which believes they folded too quickly during the budget dispute in March 2025.\n\nNot all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown. Services   deemed essential continue as normal, but most staff are not paid until the government reopens.\n\nBorder protection and law enforcement staff, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and in-hospital medical care workers are expected to operate as usual.\n\nHowever  many flights have been cancelled or delayed  because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are also expected to work without pay.\n\nThousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave. That has affected ongoing research projects at agencies lke the National Institutes of Health.  Contractors who are not directly employed by the government are missing out on work, too.\n\nUS troops were on track to miss their paycheck in mid-October until the Trump administration  identified funds to pay them . However, House Speaker Mike Johnson warned this was a \"temporary fix\" and future payments may not be made.\n\nMoney for Snap (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), commonly known as \"food stamps\", has also run out. The 41 million people enrolled in the program  will stop receiving aid from 1 November , unless the shutdown ends or Congress intervenes.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare cheques are still being distributed, although benefit verification and card issuance work may be interrupted.\n\nServices like federally-funded pre-school and institutions like the Smithsonian museums have been reduced or closed.\n\nSome major national parks and monuments across the country have closed, including Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay Area and the interior of the Washington Monument.\n\nDuring the previous shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, parks were kept open with no staff, which led to vandalism and looting at a number of historical sites.\n\nMail is still being delivered and post offices are open because the US Postal Service does not depend on Congress for funding.\n\nMost American schools are state-funded, but the federal government is responsible for billions of dollars in grants and student loans, which could effectively come to a halt.\n\nHowever, because the grants are typically awarded during the summer, schools are expected to be largely unaffected during this shutdown, according to the education secretary.\n\nMembers of Congress are still being paid, a convention that has been criticised by some politicians.\n\nIn the past, lengthy government shutdowns were seen as politically dangerous to lawmakers and the current occupant of the White House, as they disrupted voters' everyday lives.\n\nHowever this time, the White House appears more than happy to shutter large parts of the US government for an extended period. Trump has threatened to break with the past practice of returning government operations to normal, bringing spending back to previous levels, and paying workers retroactively for the shutdown.\n\nSince January, his administration has already slashed government spending and sacked many federal workers, testing the boundaries of presidential power. Now he is seeking to permanently fire \"non-essential\" workers during the shutdown.\n\n\"We'll be laying off a lot of people,\"  Trump said on 30 September , the day before the shutdown began.\n\nThe administration has also warned that furloughed \"non-essential\" workers  may not receive their unpaid salary after the shutdown finishes .\n\nOn 7 October, Trump told reporters that back pay \"depends on who we're talking about\" and that some workers \"don't deserve to be taken care of\".\n\nMany lawmakers insist this is wrong, including the top Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, who said: \"The law is clear - every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay, period.\"\n\nEarlier in October,  the administration's attempt to to lay off about 4,000 workers  was  temporarily blocked by a federal judge , but the White House is appealing against the ruling.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still represents a drag. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed, as are reviews of potential stock listings.\n\nBy one estimate, $800m in new federal contracts are not being awarded each day. Unlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and many of the companies are small businessses without other big clients to carry them through.\n\nOverall, analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth for each week that it continues - about $15bn (£11.2bn) a week.\n\nBut those losses threaten to become more substantial - and harder to make up - the longer the shutdown lasts.  The key holiday months of November and December are fast approaching and analysts are worried a shutdown will hurt shopping and spending.\n\nThere are also new possible economic factors in this shutdown, as Trump moves to fire workers or deny them backpay and cancels federally funded projects - all of which could extend or deepen any hit to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspension of key releases of economic data, like the monthly jobs report, has added to uncertainty. Without basic information about how the country is faring, policymakers could are at risk of committing grave errors.\n\nShutdowns over budgets are a unique aspect of US politics.\n\nThey have become quite common over the past 50 years - with three taking place during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nThe last shutdown, which began in late December 2018, lasted 35 days - the longest in history.\n\nIt was brought about by disagreements over funding a wall on the Mexico border.\n\nIt finally ended in part because large numbers of air traffic controllers, who had been working for a month without pay, began calling in sick, as has started to happen during the current shutdown.\n\nAt the time, flight disruption quickly spread, and the shutdown came to an end shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced economic output  by about $11bn, including $3bn that it never regained.\n\nBut shutdowns pre-date Trump.\n\nThe Republican Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his presidency in the 1980s - though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

Threat Brings a Chill\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T07:39:38-04:00\n\nAhead of the high-stakes meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, world leaders were hoping for news of an economic truce that could help stabilize the global economy. They got it.\n\nThey got something extra, as well: intensified concerns about whether the world is entering a new era of nuclear weapons proliferation among global powers.\n\nAfter a 90-minute face to face meeting in South Korea, Mr. Trump announced that the two leaders had sharply de-escalated their trade standoff, agreeing, in essence, on a yearlong cease-fire that would roll back tit-for-tat measures including steep tariffs and shutting off access to rare earth metals.\n\nThe meeting was the most anticipated and consequential event of Mr. Trump’s nearly weeklong tour through Asia, where he engaged in a series of trade and security agreements with other countries in the region, many of them geared toward containing Beijing.\n\n“I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington.\n\nThe agreement was a win for the world economy, but was brokered under the shadow of a new and sudden amplification of nuclear threats between global powers.\n\nJust minutes before he landed in Busan, South Korea, to meet with Mr. Xi, Mr. Trump announced on social media that the United States would immediately restart nuclear weapons testing after a lull of more than 30 years. The announcement came after Russia announced that it had also conducted tests of a nuclear-capable missile and sea drone this week.\n\n“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” he wrote, saying the process would begin immediately.\n\nMr. Trump did not provide any further details about the decision. But with his message, Mr. Trump seemed to be ratcheting up pressure as he prepared to meet with the leader with the world’s second- largest economy and third-largest nuclear arsenal.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Xi as a “great leader of a very powerful, very strong country.” And he appeared to soften his hard-edged statement from earlier in the day, suggesting that his announcement was not aimed at China but at other nations that he repeatedly declined to name.\n\n“We have more nuclear weapons than anybody, we don’t do testing,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ve halted it years — many years ago,” he said. “But with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”\n\nBut the chaotic backdrop to the meeting was a reminder of how Mr. Trump’s approach to issues and diplomacy can change on a dime — even on a matter as vital as the strategy governing the American nuclear arsenal — and also displayed his increasingly volatile approach to foreign policy since he retook office.\n\nThe meeting also drove home how much is at stake every time the United States and China meet now: the global economy, security across the world and the sprawling implications of negotiation between the two countries, affecting everything from individual alliances in the Indo Pacific to the outcome of the Russian invasion in Ukraine.\n\nA readout issued by the Chinese official news agency Xinhua after the meeting did not address what agreements were made but did allude to China’s recent move to cut off supplies of critical minerals.\n\nThe statement noted that Mr. Xi told Trump that recent “twists and turns” in the U.S.-China relationship should be a lesson to them both to avoid the “vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.”\n\nThe meeting concluded with clear victories for Mr. Trump’s foreign and domestic agenda.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One that China had agreed to suspend for a year its limits on exports of rare earth metals, which are crucial for a wide range of advanced manufacturing industries. The move by China earlier this month to restrict the exports had prompted Mr. Trump to threaten to cancel this week’s meeting.\n\nHe also said that Mr. Xi had agreed to take stronger action to stop the flow of precursor chemicals for making fentanyl and that the United States in response would reduce to 10 percent, from 20 percent, the fentanyl-linked tariffs it had imposed on China early this year. Reducing fentanyl deaths in the United States has been a priority for Mr. Trump.\n\nIn a social media post, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Xi had also committed to purchasing a “massive amounts of Soybeans” and other agricultural products, adding that “Our Farmers will be very happy!” He wrote that China would also “begin the process” of purchasing American energy.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump greeted Mr. Xi warmly ahead of their talks at a military base in Busan, the mood was more fraught than it had been when he met the leaders of Japan and South Korea earlier this week.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, his five days in Asia beforehand had largely been about gathering honors and securing trade deals quickly. On Thursday, the tour took a sober turn as he encountered Mr. Xi, even as he called him a “friend of mine.”\n\nBefore meeting, the two leaders tensely shook hands in front of a row of Chinese and American flags at an air base in Busan, with Mr. Trump doing the talking and Mr. Xi staying largely silent.\n\n“President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we’re going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Xi, for his part, approached the meeting with caution and steeliness. In his remarks, Mr. Xi likened China-U.S. relations to a “giant ship” that requires steady joint leadership.\n\nMr. Xi also said that he and Mr. Trump “do not always see eye to eye with each other” and said it was “normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.”\n\nHe also suggested that he would not bend to Mr. Trump’s “America First” agenda. “I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” Mr. Xi said.\n\nBefore their private meeting, the two leaders said they were focused on the long list of trade negotiations before them, and signaled they would ignore far graver concerns, including the resumption of nuclear testing among hotly competing countries and Mr. Xi’s interest in putting more distance between America and Taiwan.\n\nMr. Xi did not respond to a question about whether he would raise the issue of Taiwan at the meeting. Mr. Trump did not answer a question about why he had ordered nuclear weapons testing to resume for the first time in 33 years. The president paused before declining to answer the question, a rare reaction for an almost always spontaneous leader.\n\nMr. Trump said after the meeting that the issue of Taiwan did not come up during the leaders’ discussion. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he did not expect it to, and he would not say whether or not he supported independence for the self-governed island, which China claims as its own.\n\nThe two leaders discussed partnering to address other conflicts, he said. Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Xi had discussed the war in Ukraine at length and that they were “going to work together to see if we can get something done.”\n\nMr. Trump, who has pressured other nations to stop purchasing Russian oil, which is helping to fund its invasion of Ukraine, noted that Mr. Xi had been buying oil from Russia for a long time but said they did not really discuss the topic.\n\nMr. Trump’s announcement that he would resume nuclear testing came after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that his country had successfully tested a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missile, and then, separately, a nuclear sea drone that could set off a tsunami. And Mr. Xi is overseeing one of the fastest buildups of a nuclear arsenal on Earth.\n\nAsked whether he believed his directive would create a riskier nuclear environment, Mr. Trump brushed off its impact saying, “I think we have it pretty well locked up.”\n\nMr. Trump added that the United States was already in talks with Russia about denuclearization and that “China would be added to that.”\n\nMr. Trump’s announcement also came after he had made substantial announcements about building the defenses of American allies in the region.\n\nAt a naval base near Tokyo on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that the Japanese government had placed an order of American-made missiles to arm their fighter jets. His administration has been pressuring the Japanese to spend more on military defense.\n\nStanding next to him, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi of Japan promised that she had renewed her resolve “to make the Indo-Pacific free and open,” a reference to checking Chinese maneuvers and territorial ambitions in the South China Sea.\n\nIn South Korea, Mr. Trump highlighted the country’s investment in American shipbuilding and said later that he had given the U.S. ally​ “approval ​to build a nuclear powered submarine.”\n\nBy the time he arrived in Busan, Mr. Trump was hoping that he had collected enough leverage for an agreement with Mr. Xi and was looking for more chances to engage.\n\nThroughout his trip, Mr. Trump struck a hopeful tone about striking a deal that could bolster a fragile trade truce that the United States and China struck last month after four rounds of negotiations. As he flew back to Washington, Mr. Trump declared victory.\n\nHe called the meeting “a great success” and announced that he would visit in China in April.\n\n“The whole relationship is very, very important,” he said.\n\nDavid Pierson contributed reporting from Busan, David E. Sanger from Washington, and Lily Kuo from Taipei.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/europe/dutch-elections-geert-wilders-rob-jetten.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:34:20-04:00","title":"Centrist Party Ties Dutch Election as Far-Right Party Loses Seats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 Dutch election, the center-left Democrats 66 (D66) and the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, each won 26 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, resulting in a political deadlock.

Cuomo, the 67-year-old former governor of New York, is running as an independent mayoral candidate in the 2025 New York mayoral race, having abandoned his long-held rule of avoiding high-risk campaigns. Despite a recent primary defeat, he has launched an aggressive, media-savvy campaign, engaging with influencers like Logan Paul, facing unflattering questions on shows like 'The View,' and using AI-generated ads and high-pitched voiceovers to attack opponent Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo frames the race as a nostalgic referendum on tradition, civic order, and his legacy — particularly through references to his father Mario M. Cuomo and the political elite of New York. He claims he has not changed, despite adopting more confrontational tactics, and insists he is the true Democrat. His rhetoric includes opposition to progressive policies, corporate expansion (such as Amazon’s campus), and what he calls socialist ideologies. Though he acknowledges the shift in public sentiment, he remains committed to defending a version of New York he remembers, stating that if he loses, the city will be worse off.

Cuomo, tieless but never casual, was making a familiar point in an unfamiliar place.\n\n“You know, government is supposed to function,” Mr. Cuomo, the 67-year-old mayoral candidate, told Logan Paul, the 30-year-old influencer-wrestler-bro, seated recently in a luxury hotel room between at least six bottles of Paul-branded energy drinks and two Paul-branded snack packs. “It’s not a debating society.”\n\nThe host had something to add.\n\n“EYOOOOOOOOOO.”\n\nSuddenly Mr. Paul was shouting, transition-less, at his great many podcast listeners, smash-cutting to a prerecorded ad break about professional wrestling merch.\n\nThirty-two seconds later, Mr. Cuomo had the floor again.\n\n“There was a great senator, Ted Kennedy, God rest his soul …”\n\nThere was a governor, Andrew Cuomo, God rest his decade ruling Albany, who would have sooner traveled the state by Winnebago with Bill de Blasio, his sworn nemesis, than submit to the sundry humiliations of the modern underdog campaign.\n\nNow, straining to catch Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in the closing stages of this mayoral race, Mr. Cuomo has shown far more hustle than he did in his languid primary bid — sitting with seniors and shock-jocks, semi-smiling for cellphone selfies, play-grabbing the shoulders of men with silver hair who said they remembered his father.\n\nHe has embraced schlocky A.I.-generated advertising to depict Mr. Mamdani as a secondary character from the Austin Powers franchise; adopted a high-pitched voice to play the role of New Yorker Grateful for Andrew Cuomo’s Construction Projects as Governor (“This is nice! We did this! I feel good about New York!”); commended Mr. Paul for his feats in hydration commerce (“I’m going to bring some bottles with me”).\n\nWhat Mr. Cuomo has not done, what former aides have long said he is incapable of doing, is change.\n\nTo see him up close in the campaign’s final frames — pressing, pleading, seeing what sticks, calling his opponents meritless hacks and unbridled zealots while lamenting the bygone civility he ascribes to the less-than-utopian New York of his 1970s adolescence — is to see a man betting that this city has not changed as much as others seem to think it has, either.\n\n“Our city,” he thundered last weekend in Queens, standing atop a flatbed truck draped in hybrid American-Israeli flags. “Our city.”\n\nAnd doesn’t everyone remember? Don’t they remember when he was younger, when we all were, when he was in charge? Don’t they remember that New York — where he was feared and respected and feared and ascendant and feared and inevitable and occasionally beloved?\n\nThere is a reason his remarks lately have drifted toward a verbal slide show about his decades in public life:\n\n“When I was H.U.D. secretary …”\n\n“When I was governor …”\n\n“I go out into the briefing room — CNN, live …”\n\nHe has made it plain that his chief regret about any behavior that led to his resignation as governor is that he resigned.\n\nHe has issued increasingly foreboding warnings about “that young man” before audiences who worry, too, that a victory for Mr. Mamdani would signal the end of something for them.\n\n“He is an extremist!” Mr. Cuomo said in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, looking out on a crowd of yarmulkes and a MAGA cap or two.\n\n“Who’s the oligarch?” Mr. Cuomo asked at a senior center in Harlem, speaking beside a headshot of Barack Obama as older Black voters urged him on. (Mr. Cuomo’s $4.9 million in income last year did not preclude his hyping Mr. Mamdani’s family wealth.)\n\n“This election is a choice,” he told a business group in Midtown, “between capitalism and socialism.”\n\nYet for him, the race remains less a choice than a referendum: Andrew Cuomo or not Andrew Cuomo; unlikely redemption or another unwanted retreat.\n\nAides and allies used to invoke an iron rule of Cuomo scholarship: Since his failed first campaign for governor in 2002, he had resolved to never again risk such embarrassment, arranging to run only in elections he viewed as virtual certainties.\n\nThat he abandoned that principle after his stunning primary defeat in June is as instructive as anything, those who know him say — the crackling id behind everything he is saying and doing to reverse that recent history before it can happen again.\n\n“He lives for political power,” Frank Seddio, a former Brooklyn Democratic chairman who has known Mr. Cuomo since the 1970s, said after the two campaigned together in southeast Brooklyn last week. This was a compliment.\n\nAnd so, with some polls tightening and Mr. Cuomo’s rhetoric unbound, his last days on the trail have felt at times like a collective spasming of the old guard — or a proper countermovement, admirers hope — as a new would-be political order threatens their grip and his relevance.\n\nOutside his event with Mr. Seddio, Cuomo supporters and backers of Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, bickered on the sidewalk between a Chinese takeout spot and a vape shop, before agreeing that they should all probably leave the city together if Mr. Mamdani wins.\n\nIn Queens, hats and signs specking an outdoor crowd of more than 100 seemed as good a marker as any of Mr. Cuomo’s closing messages: “Ready on Day One.” “Mamdummy.” “Don’t Kvetch. Vote.”\n\nThere and elsewhere, Mr. Cuomo has spoken often of his father, Mario M. Cuomo, who, like his son, won three terms as governor. He suggested the elder Mr. Cuomo, who died in 2015, would not recognize a New York that elected Mr. Mamdani.\n\n“He sheds a tear,” Mr. Cuomo said, “that we need to be here.”\n\nThe younger Mr. Cuomo can likewise sound flabbergasted at his current lot — the Democratic son of a Democratic stalwart sitting for a Fox News interview as a third-party challenger with an I-for-independent identifier on the chyron, emphasizing his own fiscal discipline in a triple-bank-shot bid for conservative votes.\n\nAt nearly every appearance, though, he continues to argue he is the true Democrat.\n\n“I didn’t change,” Mr. Cuomo told Mr. Paul, noting that he was once caricatured as a “crazy liberal” and is now considered a moderate. “The planet shifted.”\n\nMr. Cuomo’s spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said that the campaign had course-corrected after a lackluster Democratic primary effort without altering the fundamental political product on offer.\n\n“We’ve never tried to sell him as anybody but himself,” he said. “Wouldn’t be right to the voters.”\n\nWhat has changed most is what Mr. Cuomo seems willing to put up with, at least in the interim.\n\nHis relative media blitz in recent weeks — after Mr. Mamdani’s success with an everywhere-all-at-once strategy in the primary — has compelled Mr. Cuomo to navigate the sort of unwieldy interactions he once tended to avoid.\n\nHe has laughed along with a right-wing radio host who said that Mr. Mamdani would cheer another 9/11-style terrorist attack on New York City.\n\nHe has smiled tightly through a procession of unflattering questions from the women of “The View”:\n\n“Why aren’t you doing better?” (“Yeah, good question.”)\n\n“Why are you losing to a democratic socialist?” (“It is a very good question.”)\n\nWhat of the sexual harassment allegations? (“It’s a good question.”)\n\nOther stops have been more comfortable for him.\n\nLast week, Mr. Cuomo visited an office building on Park Avenue to address the Association for a Better New York, a business group, and deliver some attendant reminders.\n\n“Remember Amazon!” Mr. Cuomo said, recalling left-wing opposition to the company’s planned corporate campus in Queens years ago.\n\n“A.O.C.,” an attendee whispered gravely to her seatmate in the back. (Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a high-profile supporter of Mr. Mamdani, helped lead the backlash against Amazon.)\n\nIt was a room full of people whom Mr. Cuomo had known and teased and sometimes thrilled and often tormented, people who knew him when he was permitted to thrill and to torment with civic impunity.\n\nThe session was moderated by Steven Rubenstein, the association’s chairman and the son of Howard Rubenstein, the New York public relations titan who died in 2020. Mr. Rubenstein asked Mr. Cuomo how he planned to negotiate governing partnerships amid complicated relationships across Washington and Albany.\n\n“Love,” Mr. Cuomo deadpanned. “Give love, get love, circle of love.”\n\nThis, understandably, was a laugh line.\n\nBut as he outlined the future he imagined, Mr. Cuomo lingered on the New York he remembered.\n\nHis father and Mr. Rubenstein’s father had “made this place,” Mr. Cuomo said. This was their city.\n\n“I will be damned,” he vowed, “if Steven Rubenstein and Andrew Cuomo are going to leave their children a New York that is anything less than they inherited.”\n\nAnd if he was wrong about all that — about what his city thought it needed; about what awaited New York if he lost; about what awaited him — that was not something that Mr. Cuomo seemed ready to contemplate yet.\n\n“I’m afraid for New York City,” he said. “And I am New York City.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-howeowners.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"03:00:16-04:00","title":"Where Mamdani Found the Blueprints to Run for Mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani’s experience as a foreclosure prevention counselor at Chhaya Community Development Corporation in Queens, where he provided emotional and practical support to struggling South Asian and Indo-Caribbean homeowners, has significantly shaped his political identity and messaging.

He’s been a tutor and a rapper. And in 2016, he helped his mother, the director Mira Nair, with the music in her movie, “Queen of Katwe.”\n\nBut his first and only full-time job outside of politics involved counseling struggling homeowners at a small nonprofit in Queens.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s work at the nonprofit, the Chhaya Community Development Corporation, has mostly been an aside in this year’s mayoral campaign, occasionally mentioned by his opponents to criticize his comparatively thin résumé.\n\nBut a closer look at his year there, based on accounts from current and former co-workers and his past statements, shows how Chhaya laid the path for his rise and sharpened his politics into a message of empathy that has resonated with New Yorkers amid the worst housing shortage in nearly 60 years.\n\nHousing is a top issue in the mayor’s race. The focus of both leading candidates, Mr. Mamdani, 34, and former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, 67, has mostly been on renters, who make up roughly two-thirds of New York City residents. Mr. Mamdani’s rallying cry to “freeze the rent” helped propel him to a decisive victory in the Democratic primary.\n\nStill, some three million New Yorkers live in homes that are owned and not rented. Many city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams and Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker, have spoken about the need to do more to help struggling homeowners.\n\nSeven years ago, Mr. Mamdani was learning the ropes.\n\n“No one goes to college to become a foreclosure prevention counselor,” said Will Spisak, who interviewed and hired Mr. Mamdani to work at Chhaya. “It’s hard to find that perfect fit.”\n\nWhen Mr. Mamdani applied for the job in 2018, the organization was trying to expand its foreclosure unit. Mr. Spisak knew that Mr. Mamdani, like many applicants, did not have experience working on foreclosures. But Chhaya was founded in 2000 to help New Yorkers of South Asian descent with housing and other economic issues. Mr. Mamdani, who is South Asian, won Chhaya over with his comfort around strangers and his ability to speak Bangla as well as Hindi and Urdu, which are similar when spoken.\n\nHe would meet daily with people on the brink of losing their homes after missed mortgage payments or late utility bills. He would try to negotiate with banks on their behalf, or find them aid from the government. He has said he sometimes tried to help his clients raise money on the website GoFundMe.\n\n“At my best, I can stop maybe one foreclosure a month, a couple months,” Mr. Mamdani lamented on a podcast in 2020 during his Assembly campaign. “What my job is, is to try and put people’s lives back together after they’ve been broken apart into a million pieces. The potential of legislation and being a legislator is to ensure people’s lives don’t get broken in the first place.”\n\nMr. Mamdani’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment about his time at the nonprofit.\n\nChhaya’s work on foreclosures peaked during the 2008 financial crisis, when thousands of homeowners could not pay their mortgages. In the following years, grant funding for that kind of work dried up, Mr. Spisak said.\n\nStill, many low-income homeowners continued to call for help, particularly in Queens neighborhoods with big South Asian and Indo-Caribbean populations like Jamaica, Richmond Hill and South Ozone Park. They would be assigned to someone like Mr. Mamdani to take a closer look at their case and to refer them to other programs that could help.\n\nWhile the job might have seemed bureaucratic, it was often intensely emotional and complicated. Many clients were immigrants, older people on fixed incomes and people who had bought homes for the first time. Many homes were old and needed repairs. Many families did not speak English and frequently misplaced important documents.\n\n“A lot of our senior clients don’t have family members,” said Tenying Yangsel, Chhaya’s assistant director of homeownership, who began working on foreclosures when Mr. Mamdani left. “So they come, and even just to get through the appointments, we have to spend like two or three hours with them.”\n\nAt first, Mr. Spisak said, Mr. Mamdani needed help learning how to manage the meticulous amount of paperwork involved for the 100 or so cases the group dealt with in a year. But he learned quickly, Mr. Spisak said, and even pushed Chhaya in new directions.\n\nOnce, Mr. Spisak said, Mr. Mamdani recognized that the organization let employees take time off during holidays that were more common in America, like Columbus Day, but not Eid or Diwali, that might be more relevant to the South Asian community. He led an internal push to get those holidays off, Mr. Spisak said.\n\nMr. Mamdani also wanted Chhaya to be more proactive in how it found clients, Mr. Spisak said. He decided to investigate tax lien sales.\n\nEvery year, New York City, like many other cities and towns, sells the right to collect overdue property taxes and other bills to people who will then collect the outstanding debt. Mr. Mamdani looked at the list of properties in Queens on the list, keying in on the names that sounded South Asian.\n\nThen, on one summer weekend, Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Spisak set out to visit them, driving home to home. Mr. Mamdani would hop out, knock on the door and talk to each person. In between, the two listened to music by the band Weezer and the musician K’naan.\n\nIntaz Khan, 72, bought a home in South Ozone Park around 2008, but he quickly fell behind on mortgage and insurance payments, he said.\n\n“It caught me off guard,” he said. “I was in a desperate situation.”\n\nHe contacted Chhaya for help and got his mortgage rate reduced. He has been relying on the organization for help ever since, and on one occasion remembers meeting Mr. Mamdani during a visit to Chhaya’s office. Mr. Mamdani looked through his bank statements and called the mortgage company to check on the status of his loan, he said.\n\n“He helped me in whatever way he could,” Mr. Khan said.\n\nHe said he had not thought about Mr. Mamdani until he saw him on the news recently. “I told my wife, I know that guy,” he said.\n\nMr. Spisak said Mr. Mamdani grew frustrated at times when he wasn’t able to help people.\n\n“He would frequently, not in a necessarily bad way, raise the issue, ‘There aren’t enough resources for the people we are serving,’” Mr. Spisak said.\n\nWhen a seat in the State Assembly seemed attainable, Mr. Mamdani jumped at the opportunity, and Chhaya let him take a leave of absence.\n\n“Homes should not be a place of financial speculation — they should be a place of stability and setting a foundation for a family to build on for the rest of their lives,” Mr. Mamdani said in a 2020 interview about his campaign.\n\nForeshadowing his mayoral politics, he added then: “This is not the only issue we care about, but the reason it’s a flagship issue is that it’s a building block of the major crisis facing New Yorkers across all communities.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-displacement.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:22:06-04:00","title":"Syria’s Rocky Transition Brings New Waves of Displacement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the end of Syria’s 14-year civil war with the ousting of dictator Bashar al-Assad, the country entered a fragile transition phase marked by renewed displacement.

It was 9:34, and masked thieves were about to barge through the window.\n\nThe room froze, suspended for a moment of confusion, according to her husband, who locked eyes with her. Then they heard a piercing sound from the balcony outside: The thieves were firing up a disc grinder that could cut through reinforced glass.\n\n“The attendant said ‘Everyone get out,’” said Ms. Barker, a middle-school teacher who participated in enough active-shooter drills to convince her this was a terrorist attack.\n\nShe and her husband clasped hands and rushed from the gallery with the 20 or so other visitors. They turned back only once, as the same attendant pulled the doors closed and shouted “Run!”\n\nIt would be about 90 minutes before the Barkers learned they had been witness to the biggest heist at the world’s most famous museum since 1911, when the Mona Lisa was stolen.\n\nMore than a week after the burglary, in which thieves made off with more than $100 million worth of jewels in broad daylight, the country is still reeling, stunned by its brazenness, shocked by the clear security failures, and less and less hopeful the jewelry will be recovered intact.\n\nMuch is still unknown by the public, including whether the thieves scouted the location as experts say museum robbers do, and whether they had any help from an accomplice within the museum.\n\nBut a picture of the crime has started to emerge, in testimony by French authorities, interviews with Louvre staff and local media reports. It suggests that the thieves had a careful plan, which included stealing the truck-mounted electric ladder they used to reach the second floor. They posed as workmen complete with yellow vests and seemed to have an exact idea of which cases they wanted to break into. (One was the case Ms. Barker had been admiring.)\n\nAnd they cut hand-sized holes with specialized tools that the Louvre’s own firefighting manual says are efficient for opening cases if there’s a blaze. Experts said the cases that display museums’ most valuable items are normally designed to withstand some 140 hammer blows or ax strikes, enough to exhaust a thief, and they called the use of disc grinders innovative.\n\nStill, information leaking out also shows that in the end, the thieves were as frazzled as they had been careful. In their rush to escape, they left a trove of evidence that led the police directly to two of them so far.\n\nOn Saturday night, the police arrested the two men they believe entered the gallery and late Wednesday night formally charged them with thefts committed by an organized gang and criminal association. They caught one man at Charles de Gaulle airport, the Paris prosecutor said, as he was attempting to leave with a one-way ticket to Algeria. The second was arrested 40 minutes later near his home in a Paris suburb. Their two accomplices remain at large.\n\n“How do you do all that, and then get caught at the airport?” said Brian Ledsinger from Houston, Texas, who was also in the Apollo Gallery when the thieves broke in. “They were amateurs who were also smart.”\n\nFor the Louvre, the fatal flaw was the weaknesses in its security system, especially its perimeter cameras, the museum’s director, Laurence des Cars, admitted to the French Senate last week. The outdoor cameras are very old, she told a hearing, and so scarce that they don’t cover the entire facade.\n\nOn a recent visit to the museum, a Times reporter counted about 25 cameras on the museum’s perimeter, only five of which were on the outer walls rather than inner courtyards. The British Museum says it has several dozen surveying its much smaller perimeter. In response to questions, the Louvre said it would not comment on the external cameras.\n\nThe museum’s\n\ndirector said this\n\ncamera did not\n\ncapture the\n\nQuai François Mitterrand\n\nArts Décoratifs\n\nArts Décoratifs\n\nQuai François Mitterrand\n\nApollo Gallery\n\nWhere thieves broke in\n\nSeine River\n\nThe museum’s director\n\nsaid this camera did not\n\ncapture the balcony.\n\nSource: OpenStreetMap (basemap)\n\nCatherine Porter and Samuel Granados/The New York Times\n\nBut perhaps most important, the site the thieves targeted was covered by a single outdoor security camera — and it was aimed west of the balcony, so it did not capture the break-in, the museum director said.\n\nHad the camera been positioned differently, it could have shown security guards in the museum’s control room the thieves ascending to the balcony on the electric ladder. Instead the guards were blind for the four critical minutes it took the intruders to get in place before they began cutting the window, delaying calls to the police.\n\nBut on Wednesday a police official acknowledged in testimony to the Senate that they, too, had a role in protecting the museum’s perimeter and had suffered their own lapse. Vincent Annereau, the head of the Paris police crime prevention service, said the police have seven street cameras around the Louvre, and one had captured the thieves’ arrival, but no one noticed, or suspected a problem, until they received alerts that a burglary was in progress. He blamed the oversight on the fact that construction work is commonplace in Paris and that the police do not have artificial intelligence to help monitor the cameras.\n\nThe camera was positioned in the opposite direction, the museum’s director said.\n\nElectric ladder\n\nused by the\n\nThe camera was positioned in the opposite direction, the museum’s director said.\n\nElectric ladder\n\nused by the\n\nThe camera was positioned in the opposite direction, the museum’s director said.\n\nElectric ladder used\n\nby the thieves\n\nSource: Photo by Dimitar Dilkoff /AFP via Getty Images\n\nSamuel Granados/The New York Times\n\nBased on the timing of the break-in provided so far by various officials, including the museum’s director, it seems likely that the police missed the intruders by less than a minute. It took officers just three minutes to arrive after they were notified by museum staff and a passing cyclist, the Paris police chief said. But they had been notified only after the thieves began to carve into the display cases — and the intruders rushed away with eight precious items less than three minutes later.\n\nFour thieves arrived at 9:30 and parked their truck. Two ascended the ladder. The others remained with the getaway vehicles: two motor scooters.\n\nAfter barging into the gallery, the first thief headed directly to the display case where Ms. Barker had been moments before, according to a report in the French newspaper Le Parisien that summarized confidential museum surveillance footage of the crime that its reporter saw. The targeted case was not the closest to the window, but fifth in a line that stretched down the 200-foot gallery. Alongside Napoleon’s wedding gift, it contained a sapphire necklace and matching tiara and earrings that had belonged to France’s last queen, Marie-Amelie.\n\nThe second thief, who was wearing a motorcycle helmet, attacked the neighboring case.\n\nBy the Louvre’s standards, the cases were relatively new, built in 2019 with reinforced glass that can withstand bullets. In the event of a fire, they were also designed to be broken by firefighters, a former senior member of Louvre’s firefighting unit told The New York Times.\n\nAlarms began sounding in the guards’ control room when the window was breached, and new alerts were sent as the thieves attacked the two cases, according to the museum director’s testimony. From that room, the museum’s chief operations manager called the closest police station, just over half a mile away, the Louvre’s head of security, Dominique Buffin, told senators last week. The manager also pressed an emergency alert button, alerting the central police prefecture as well.\n\nThe footage seen by Le Parisien showed what happened next in the gallery, the newspaper reported. The thieves remained calm while working, even as two museum guards tried to scare them off. One approached with a metal pole, but one of the intruders waved him back.\n\nThen the burglars’ composure seemed to crack; they got sloppy. One dropped some jewelry and stopped to stuff it back into his bag, but the burglars left a glove and jeweled brooch behind. The footage also showed the helmeted thief diving head first into the ladder’s basket, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office declined to comment on Le Parisien’s report.\n\nA video posted on X and corroborated by Storyful, a company that reviews social media content, appears to show the suspects escaping by riding down the mechanical ladder.\n\nA museum attendant told the French television channel BFM that he and some colleagues had heard an alert and rushed outside from the museum’s lobby and down to the street toward where the thieves had parked. They arrived just as the motor scooters drove away.\n\nThe guard said they found holes in the truck’s gas tank and a blowtorch nearby — a sign that the thieves had likely hoped to burn the truck to destroy evidence.\n\nInstead, they left behind a cache of evidence, including power tools, gloves, a motorcycle helmet and one of the yellow vests they wore, the authorities say.\n\nThey also dropped the crown of Empress Eugénie.\n\n“Even when well-prepared, thieves often make mistakes due to rushing,” said Olivier Halnais, the head of the national union of forensic police officers.\n\nHe described what was left behind as a treasure trove for investigators, saying a helmet, for instance, would be “very rich” with DNA from sweat and saliva droplets, and that samples could be matched with the millions in a national database.\n\nLaure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor, said on Wednesday that investigators had processed 150 forensic samples, including DNA traces and fingerprints, at the crime scene and on objects left behind. One of the thief’s DNA was found on the broken window and other things, she said. The other’s was on a motor scooter found by police.\n\nThe more than 100 officers on the case have been racing to catch the perpetrators before they could break the jewelry into individual stones and melt the metals down for sale. So far, no recovery has been announced.\n\nThat has left a profound sense of loss, at the Louvre and beyond.\n\nIn a written response to questions, the museum’s decorative arts director, Olivier Gabet, said he had entered the Apollo Gallery the night of the heist to help the police. He was “overwhelmed by the icy silence of the place,” and struck by the sight of the stands where the precious objects had rested. They were mostly empty, though he said the thieves had missed a few items.\n\nMr. Ledsinger, the Houston resident who was visiting the Apollo Gallery on that fateful morning, was evacuated before he got to see the snatched jewels. “That’s world history,” he said, he said of the items. “That’s why we are there, to see and experience and to immerse ourselves in what it was like back then.”\n\nMs. Barker, who was mesmerized by the jewels before rushing out with her husband, said she keeps watching the news back in Indianapolis, hoping the jewels — including the emerald and diamond necklace she admired — are recovered intact.\n\n“I think I’m one of the last people to see that necklace and admire it,” she said.\n\nSégolène Le Stradic and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris and Alex Marshall from London.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/29/us/us-caribbean-pacific-boat-strikes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:07:20-04:00","title":"Tracking U.S. Military Killings in Boat Attacks","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since September 2, 2025, the U.S. military has conducted a series of boat attacks in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, targeting vessels suspected of drug smuggling.

U.S. Military Killings in Boat Attacks\n\nPublished: 2025-10-29T20:07:20-04:00\n\nBy Lazaro Gamio, Carol Rosenberg and Charlie Savage\n\nNote: Images are sourced from social media posts by President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nSince Sept. 2, the U.S. military has been attacking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs, killing dozens of people. A broad range of legal specialists on the use of lethal force have said that the strikes are illegal extrajudicial killings because the military is not permitted to deliberately target civilians — even suspected criminals — who do not pose an imminent threat of violence.\n\nThis is a drastic departure from past practice. The Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, has typically treated maritime drug smuggling in the Caribbean as a law enforcement problem, interdicting boats and arresting people for prosecution if suspicions of illicit cargo turn out to be correct.\n\nThe White House has said the killings are lawful. It cited a notice to Congress in which the administration said President Trump “determined” that the United States is in a formal armed conflict with drug cartels and that crews of drug-running boats are “combatants.” It has not supplied a legal theory to bridge the conceptual gulf between drug trafficking and an armed attack.\n\nThe New York Times is tracking the boat strikes as details become available. The strike locations and casualty figures are drawn from postings by Mr. Trump or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and have not been independently confirmed by The Times.\n\nThis was the sixth strike in the Pacific in eight days.\n\nThis was one of three strikes on four boats in one day in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Mr. Hegseth said that Mexican search and rescue authorities had “accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue,” but he did not release further details.\n\n*Officials did not specify which of the four destroyed boats the survivor was on in the strikes of Oct. 27.\n\nThis was the second strike in the same day in eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\n*Officials did not specify which of the four destroyed boats the survivor was on in the strikes of Oct. 27.\n\nThis was the third strike in the same day in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\n*Officials did not specify which of the four destroyed boats the survivor was on in the strikes of Oct. 27.\n\nThis attack, in the Caribbean Sea, was the first at night, Mr. Hegseth said.\n\nThis was the second strike in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis was the first strike in the eastern Pacific Ocean, an expansion of the strike campaign.\n\nMr. Hegseth described those on the boat as affiliated with Ejército de Liberación Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group. The strike took place in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThis strike was on a semisubmersible in the Caribbean Sea. Two men from the boat were rescued by the U.S. military and repatriated within days to Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nThis strike took place “just off the Coast of Venezuela,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nColombia’s president said this boat was carrying Colombian citizens.\n\nOfficials from the Dominican Republic said they recovered cocaine from the wreckage after this strike.\n\nColombia’s president said the strike occurred near his country and killed an innocent fisherman.\n\nThe first strike on a boat alleged to be carrying drugs was near Trinidad in the Caribbean Sea. The boat appeared to have turned around before being struck.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/opinion/palantir-shyam-sankar-military.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:45.123Z","title":"The Importance of Cultural Sensitivity in Global Communication","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article published on April 15, 2024, discusses the growing need for cultural sensitivity in global communication.

In its own eyes, it’s doing essential patriotic work.\n\nYou’ll hear that argument from my guest this week, Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir, who was also recently commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve.\n\nBelow is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYTimes app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nRoss Douthat: Shyam Sankar, welcome to “Interesting Times.”\n\nShyam Sankar: Great to be here. Thanks for having me, Ross.\n\nDouthat: So we’re going to talk about a lot of things. We’re going to talk about your biography and background, how you came to be an officer in the U.S. military, the future of technology and warfare. But we have to start with a very, very simple question: What is it that Palantir does?\n\nSankar: Great question.\n\nDouthat: Thank you.\n\nSankar: Obviously the most important question, yeah.\n\nDouthat: I spent a long time crafting it, I have to say.\n\nSankar: Let’s start at a foundational level. We’re a software company and we build software that allows you to manage your data to make better decisions. And I think that’s best understood through an example.\n\nI spend a lot of my time helping companies manufacture things — really, the reindustrialization of America. If you’re a manufacturer, you have a system called a P.L.M. system — product lifecycle management system — that you use to design your product. You have another system that you use to manage the manufacturing, the actual production of it, on the assembly line. You have another system called an ERP system, for inventory management and supply chain management, and yet another system for managing sales orders. What we do is we build software that allows you to bring the data from those systems together so that you can manage the process holistically.\n\nNow, half of what Palantir does is commercial. We work in 50 different industries from energy and mining, to pharmaceuticals and insurance. In the commercial world, you’re optimizing the value chain. You have a series of decisions that you’re making from the hand of your supplier to the hand of your customer.\n\nAnd of course, you can generalize it to the military, which we’re very well known for what we do there. You can think about that as you’re optimizing the kill chain from sensor to shooter, they call it doctrinally, but it’s the same thing as: How do I find the enemy targets? How do I decide which targets I want to prosecute, based on maybe the inventory I have on hand and the effect it might have on the enemy? How do I manage my personnel readiness? How do I manage my equipment readiness?\n\nAll of these things need to work, or it doesn’t work.\n\nDouthat: So, your C.E.O., Alex Karp, did an interview with my colleague Maureen Dowd a little while ago, and he had this extremely resonant phrase. He said that Palantir is in the business of “the finding of hidden things.” A lot of the narrative about Palantir assumes that  means you go to work for a government or a corporation, and then you go out and find those things in the external world. But in your description, it’s that you’re finding things that institutions already have access to, but don’t know or don’t understand.\n\nSankar: Yeah, the cynical way to think about Palantir is it took something as sexy as James Bond to motivate engineers to work on a promise as boring as data integration. But that’s actually the core of what generates the value.\n\nIf you look at any of these institutions, they have so many silos of data, and they all have a specific purpose, but the greater truth is lost in the seams between these systems. And historically, we’ve just relied on humans connecting the dots in their heads. So we build Iron Man suits for those humans to be able to ask questions of the data, usually with the normative view of getting to a decision.\n\nSo it’s not insights for insights’ sake, but it’s actually: What am I trying to do? How do I optimize the operation of the business?\n\nDouthat: And so, from the public’s point of view, the reason Palantir is a big figure in national politics and national debates is that half of your work is done for military, government and so on, right?\n\nSankar: Yeah.\n\nDouthat: And that’s not just a business choice. There is a values-based theory that Palantir has of why you do that kind of work. Can you talk about that?\n\nSankar: Yeah, and I would even just state it even more strongly: We started in the government. We started really as a small group of folks who wanted to work on problems in national security.\n\nAnd if you rewind and go back to this immediate period, post-9/11, the political discourse was very much something like: What’s more important: privacy or security?\n\nAs a bunch of engineers, we thought that was a silly question. They both seemed really important. Why wouldn’t we be trying to have more of both? You have to actually build technologies that are cognizant of both ends of these things and are pushing out the frontier.\n\nDouthat: We’re going to come back to the privacy question a bit more, but in the case of government, you have silos of information that the government has access to, but some parts of the government are not supposed to use or deploy, for reasons having to do with constitutional rights and privacy.\n\nYou are not responsible for the choices that companies or the Department of Defense make about when to access something and when not to. You create a structure that gives them opportunities to say: You can’t access this, or this department can’t access that — but they’re, in the end, running it.\n\nSankar: Exactly. They’re responsible.\n\nDouthat: They’re responsible. OK.\n\nSankar: I didn’t really address your question of the moral view we have, which is why we started the company, that the West is a force for good. We believe in strengthening the legitimacy of these institutions. We should have been able to connect the dots and prevent 9/11.\n\nSo what is the role of us as technologists in this country? What is our obligation to America? How can we be helping? And we believe in leaning in and solving these problems, and our war fighters should have the best software.\n\nDouthat: It’s worth noting that your company is named for seeing stones used to view things at a very long distance in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.” And the Palantíri, these seeing stones, were used by the noble kingdoms of the West in that story.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that in the course of the Tolkien story, they fall into the wrong hands and are used for evil as well.\n\nSankar: The naming choice was intentional. It’s a built-in warning and reminder to us.\n\nDouthat: That you’re basically building something that is potentially —\n\nSankar: You’re building something powerful and you have an obligation on how it’s used, and you have to be thoughtful of this stuff. My broad critique societally would be: There’s what to build, and how to build it.\n\nThe Valley is obsessed with how to build things. Engineering is a craft, and very little thought is given to: What should we build? What are the valuable things for society? What is the greater second-order consequence of what we’re doing here?\n\nI’d like to get both of these things right. You have to be right about how you’re going to build these things — world-class software — and you have to build the right thing that matters for the nation.\n\nDouthat: But any right thing, as you said in the warning, is going to be powerful enough to be misused, potentially.\n\nSankar: Yeah.\n\nDouthat: By the Sarumans, if not the Saurons, of the 21st century.\n\nSo now, I want to see if you can walk me through two examples — one foreign, and one domestic — of the zones where Palantir’s software is being used by the government. And I’ll see how concrete I can get you to make it, because I know that we’re talking about areas where there’s confidentiality and national security.\n\nSo let’s start. You talked before about the kill chain. What is the kill chain?\n\nSankar: The kill chain is the sequence of decisions — this is a doctrinal military term — of how you go from sensor to shooter. It’s the targeting process. So how do I identify where the enemy is? How do I confirm positive ID, go through the rules of engagement, get the JAG sign-off that this is a legal target? How do I then send that to the gun line to prosecute the target? Having prosecuted the target, how do I then do a battle damage assessment and understand: Did I hit the target? — and then cycle back around to: What do I do next?\n\nDouthat: Let’s say U.S. Special Forces are operating in Central Asia or the Horn of Africa or something, and they are faced with a particular mission. What happens that Palantir is involved in? Let’s say they have a mission where they’re trying to take out a member of a terrorist group.\n\nSankar: Or we could use an example like the Houthis. You could say that there’s some starting point of intelligence — it could be from overhead imagery, it could be from any number of sensors that are out there — that there’s something at this location. OK, now then how do I spend —\n\nDouthat: Primarily satellite information? Or just a whole range?\n\nSankar: Terrestrial sensors, satellite information — so, space-based terrestrial are the opportunities, really. You’re never going to just prosecute off of one single source of intelligence. So, OK, can I corroborate this with other sources of intelligence? How do I get a positive ID that this is not a decoy, and maybe I’m not misattributing what it is that I’m looking at here?\n\nThere’s a prioritization process. Is this worth shooting? Is this a threat? What is the effect of taking this capability off the battle space? Does it provide safety? Does it provide more room to maneuver, or is it actually irrelevant?\n\nLet’s assume we decide it’s important to take out of the battle space. Maybe they’re going to fire a missile at a destroyer. Then it’s —\n\nDouthat: The Houthi are going to fire a missile at our destroyer. So we’re trying to pre-empt?\n\nSankar: Yeah.\n\nDouthat: OK.\n\nSankar: So then we go through the process. There’s legal sign-off. Then you get to the point of: OK, well, how do I want to interdict this? Am I going to use a $2 million missile? What are my options for doing this? How long will it take? What are the consequences of logistics? What’s the time in flight to get there? Can I actually action this?\n\nThen there’s sending that to the gun line or the weapon system that will do it. And then there’s scheduling the collection. Maybe you’re going to use overhead imagery and you’re going to fly a drone with a camera to see, having shot it, did we eliminate it or not?\n\nSo that cycle is really — that’s the kill chain. And the whole point of this is applying technology to be faster than your adversary at going through that. If you’re faster than your adversary at going through that, assuming you’re fighting, you’re going to win. Assuming you’re not fighting, you’re going to have maximal deterrence.\n\nDouthat: So the “we” here is the U.S. military.\n\nSankar: Yes.\n\nDouthat: It’s not Palantir.\n\nSankar: That’s right.\n\nDouthat: You are not personally running the kill chain. But who is actually managing the process?\n\nSankar: The combatant commanders — the green suiters and blue suiters, as we call it. The military itself.\n\nDouthat: So the soldier on the ground is therefore downstream of the information that Palantir software is collating and spitting out for the people giving commands to him or her.\n\nSankar: That’s right. And the software extends to enable collaboration. I think part of the value is you want a single pane of data. We’re all seeing the same thing, but you have multiple panes of glass. So the soldier on the ground might be looking at it on their mobile phone, and you might have, in the situation room, a big command center view of the whole battle space.\n\nBut what you want to know is that we’re all looking at the same thing, even if we’re looking at it through different applications or mechanisms relative to where we sit.\n\nDouthat: This would apply basically across areas where the U.S. is doing military intervention. So what you’re describing presumably applies to elements of our attack against the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nSankar: Yeah.\n\nDouthat: Or it would apply to the politically highly controversial attacks in the Caribbean or the Pacific that the Trump administration has been conducting. Those are the overseas zones where what you’re doing is integrated into what the U.S. military is doing.\n\nSankar: Yeah, our software is deployed ubiquitously across the military.\n\nI mean, I think there’s actually even a bigger question there where the military is a massive enterprise, and I think one of the most important missing strategic assets for us is an integrated view from the factory floor to the foxhole. People spend a lot of time thinking about the sharpest end of the kill chain. Like how do we intervene —\n\nDouthat: For understandable reasons.\n\nSankar: Yeah. But if you think about the complexity of the problem, you start realizing: well, we spend a large amount of money building weapons. How do we know we’re building the right weapons? How do we know the consequences they’re going to have in the foxhole three years from now, when you deploy DGGs — a destroyer — out? All these ships need maintenance at some point. So if you’re extending the deployment, you’re deferring the maintenance. How do you trade off present readiness against future readiness?\n\nThese are the sorts of questions that I think are much more strategic, that are hard to answer, but are determinative on delivering deterrence.\n\nDouthat: And so Palantir treats the military as both a kill chain problem and a corporate supply chain problem? You’re working on both effectively?\n\nSankar: Yeah.\n\nDouthat: So, obviously anything the U.S. does that kills people overseas is controversial, but probably the most controversial thing that Palantir software is being used for right now, I would say, is for immigration enforcement with ICE and other organizations. Can you talk a little bit about how Palantir software is integrated there?\n\nSankar: Yeah, certainly. Well, first, I think a lot of the controversy moves with the politics. We first started working with ICE when Jaime Zapata, an ICE agent, was assassinated in Mexico in 2011, under the Obama administration. We’ve worked with ICE from then on, until the present moment.\n\nThe work is structurally very similar. There’s information that D.H.S. [Department of Homeland Security] has access to that is spread out across the component agencies that humans are trying to look up — they’re literally doing searches in all these systems. So how do we enable them to actually see the whole picture, and then use that for resource allocation?\n\nSo, where do we have threats? Where should we be allocating people? How do we prosecute removal operations? That’s, in many ways, exactly what we’re doing.\n\nDouthat: So, a couple of things. Number one: I think Palantir has a $30 million contract to build a platform called ImmigrationOS. What kind of data is available to enforcement and removal operations?\n\nSankar: So, encounters at the border; asylum applications, or the lack of one; applications for benefits. A lot of this data really relates to non–permanent resident, non–U.S. citizens who are interacting with various facets of D.H.S. as they come here.\n\nDouthat: So it’s data on specific encounters — encounters they have with Border Patrol, criminal justice system and so on. But does it extend to things like last known address?\n\nSankar: So, what was the address they reported in the border encounter? What was the address they reported when they applied for benefits?\n\nDouthat: So then that becomes the kind of data that, if ICE is doing a raid, they end up using to say: OK, we have this person here — and so on.\n\nSankar: That’s right.\n\nDouthat: So it is effectuating rage through that mechanism. To what extent does it go beyond that? Is there integration with local law enforcement, for instance, with any of this stuff?\n\nSankar: I don’t believe so.\n\nDouthat: OK.\n\nSankar: But I think the real question — just zooming out a little bit: we’re working with agencies that have lawful authorities. So, what data are they collecting? — That’s the data we’re helping them integrate.\n\nIf there’s a lawful authority for them to collect the data — I don’t think local law enforcement is part of this. I’m not saying I have an objection to them being part of this. I’m just saying that —\n\nDouthat: No, I’m just trying to get into the core fear that people have about — well, there’s two layers of fears that I think people have with this kind of domestic data collection, that are distinct from people who just oppose deportation. One layer, which as far as I can tell is overstated or wrong, is that Palantir is going out and devising —\n\nSankar: We have no data.\n\nDouthat: But you’re not devising systems to acquire new forms of data for the government, right?\n\nSankar: Correct.\n\nDouthat: But you are creating systems where the government has access to data — and I think this is important — on a scale that no government has ever had access to before. Like, one of the unique features of 21st-century digital age America is that it’s just so much easier to track and observe people in all kinds of different ways. Corporate America does that even more than the government does.\n\nSankar: I think so. But I don’t think that’s the fundamental inflection.\n\nDouthat: OK.\n\nSankar: I think it’s really that the number of decisions you’re trying to make are growing much more quickly than your headcount is growing. So, let’s just say in the ICE case, you would’ve had roughly on the order of 20 systems that you would have to manually go search across.\n\nDouthat: As you’re trying to find the address of someone who you want to deport.\n\nSankar: Do you think you’re going through all 20 systems? Maybe you stop at 10, maybe you forgot to search some systems. The entropy is just that you’re not actually able to do the work. You’re fighting your tooling the whole time.\n\nAnd this leads to the lack of legitimacy of the institution — you’re not able to do the thing that you’re actually supposed to do. The complexity of this is growing as you’re asked to do more and more. Like, maybe I was doing 10 things before and I could do it with the people I had; now I have to do a thousand things. That means I clearly don’t get to all thousand things, and the things I get to, I’m not doing them well.\n\nOK, well, why are we using the human to search 20 different systems? That’s clearly a problem that technology can do. How do we use the human to do things that are uniquely human, that require human judgment?\n\nDouthat: I guess I’m just saying that I think, for at least some people — and maybe I’m among them — there’s a relief in the idea that all of this data has multiplied so quickly that authorities can’t quite keep up with it.\n\nSo if we walk outside of this room and enter Midtown Manhattan, we are under constant surveillance. It’s not all government surveillance, but there’s a relaxation that you can feel where you’re like: OK, but all of this surveillance is distributed across so many different public and private entities, and unless I am literally a terrorist, the odds that people are going to be constantly watching and scrutinizing me are very low.\n\nBut then the fear becomes: Well, if we have this incredible way to make it all more and more and more efficient, then maybe privacy does start to disappear.\n\nI don’t know. What do you make of that?\n\nSankar: There’s two thoughts there. One is: Well, are you saying that you feel safer because the institutions that are supposed to protect you are structurally incompetent?\n\nAnd that’s the part where I feel like —\n\nDouthat: The answer might be: Yes, sometimes — right?\n\nSankar: Yeah. And then a consequence of that — which I think a democracy can decide — is that they also can’t do their job. They can’t protect you from the things that they’re supposed to protect you from.\n\nSo I’d offer another solution to this, which is: They should be really good at doing what they’re doing, and we should have a strong ability to oversee that they’re not doing things that they’re not supposed to be doing.\n\nThat’s exactly what we designed Palantir to do.\n\nSo this wasn’t our system, but I think it’s an illustrative example because it was high profile at the time: If you go back in time, there were government employees who looked up the passports of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and they got caught. How did they get caught? The system they were using generates audit logs, people were reviewing the audit log, and did you have a permissible use to look this up? The answer was clearly no. And they were quickly caught and terminated.\n\nSo you have to both help the people who are protecting us, and you have to empower the people who are watching the watchers so that they also have asymmetrically strong technology to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nDouthat: So who is watching the watchers? We can stick with immigration enforcement: Presumably there’s data and information that is protected by privacy that ICE is not supposed to be accessing, right?\n\nSankar: So the first line of defense is on the front end, like: Do you even have authority to have this data?\n\nThe lawyers on the front end have data use agreements that they have with their own interagency data use agreements and the authorities that collected the data to begin with.\n\nAnd then the second line of defense, after they have the data, is: Are you using it for permitted use?\n\nAnd that’s usually, I don’t know, for every agency this is — look, I’m a builder, so consult a policy person — but something like the Office of the Inspector General or other law enforcement agencies that are responsible for this. Sometimes, depending on the context, it can actually be counterintelligence.\n\nIt’s the same infrastructure that you would use to make sure that people aren’t abusing the data. It’s how you would also make sure that you don’t have a spy in your organization.\n\nDouthat: In the end, though, it is up to the people running those institutions to decide whether to basically track abuses at all.\n\nSankar: That’s right.\n\nDouthat: So it might be at different levels and different agencies. But presumably, in the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem would have the authority to track or not track abuses to some degree?\n\nSankar: I mean, yeah. I think that’s a little bit of a nihilistic view. There’s statutory requirements on this. I understand the perspective, but I don’t agree with it — of, hey, we can’t trust these institutions at all.\n\nThere are rules — they follow the rules. They’re also humans. They’re not infallible. But I don’t think people are willy-nilly deciding whether they want to do this or not.\n\nDouthat: No, I don’t think so either. I’m just trying to frame what I think are the most commonplace criticisms and critiques and worries about how this technology is used in the context of the second Trump administration. From the point of view of someone who is a skeptic of Palantir, [they] might say: well, in the end, you are putting a lot of power into the hands of people that this person — who thinks Donald Trump is a threat to the republic — doesn’t trust.\n\nThere is a way in which you, independent of what you think about Trump himself, when Palantir goes to work for a government — U.S. government, any other government — are putting yourself in the position of trusting that government with this very impressive technology that you’ve built.\n\nSankar: Yeah. I think that’s right. You have to pick your customers.\n\nDouthat: Can I just ask about that process? Because I think it’s interesting. How do you calibrate that kind of decision making?\n\nSo, just recently, the United Kingdom rolled out a plan to have a new digital ID, and I believe the head of Palantir in the U.K. said: We don’t think there’s enough privacy safeguards here, and we’re not going to cooperate with the government on this.\n\nThat’s an exact example of this practical, but also moral, decision making. What kind of thinking goes into a decision like that?\n\nSankar: Well, I’m probably not the best person to comment on as the C.T.O., but I think I’d have to go back to the quote. I think what Louis Mosley said was that this is an issue for the ballot box.\n\nDouthat: Louis Mosley is the head of Palantir in the U.K.\n\nSankar: That’s right. So, look, there’s a lot of discursive interaction both internally at Palantir — there’s an obvious threshold question of: Is this a legal use? Is this a government that you trust and work with?\n\nBeyond that, it’s really a question of, are the authorities there? What’s the potential for misuse? Are the protections there in our software against those potential abuses? And is the work actually going to lead to something meaningful?\n\nDouthat: See, that’s really interesting though, that he said it’s a matter for the ballot box. And again, I know you’re not running that decision, but still, as an outsider to the work your company does, it seems like he — or the larger corporate enterprise — made basically a political judgment that the digital ID issue had not been adequately litigated by British democracy for you to cooperate with it. That’s a fascinating decision.\n\nSankar: You should talk to Louis about that.\n\nI would give you the other side of that, which is that I think a lot of the policies, a lot of things that people are struggling with right now in the U.S. were voted on at the ballot box. What ICE is doing was voted on at the ballot box.\n\nDouthat: So Palantir — again, not that you speak for everyone at Palantir — but Palantir is more comfortable with mass deportations in the context of a world where Donald Trump campaigned on mass deportations and won, than it might be in a world where he had not mentioned deportations at all, and then asked Palantir to design a mass deportation–abetting software.\n\nSankar: What I’m saying is, like, the people voted on this.\n\nDouthat: Right.\n\nSankar: That seems like a functioning democracy there. And of course, there’s going to continue to be discursive interaction and disagreement. That’s the beauty of our political process, but it’s an important distinction.\n\nDouthat: Yeah. How do you think about that with foreign clients? Obviously, Palantir does work for the state of Israel. That is, again, obviously a source of controversy. So you’re making a judgment that Israel is a morally appropriate partner.\n\nSankar: Yes.\n\nDouthat: Do you do work with non-democratic governments?\n\nSankar: We do work with the U.S. and our allies. The nature of the work depends particularly, I think, on the coalitions that are fighting terrorism, the coalitions that are pushing back on the great power competition that we’re in with the Big Four.\n\nDouthat: But if the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called you up and said: we just want to build a digital ID system — you would be less likely to do that work because they’re not a democratic government? Would that be fair?\n\nSankar: I would leave that up to Alex [Karp] to figure out. It depends on their uses.\n\nI’m not sure that’s exactly fair. I mean, is it leading to a more efficient electronic government? What’s the purpose of it? That’s the question. There’s a difference of, which agency’s doing it? And what is their mandate? What data do they have? What are the work flows they’re trying to enable?\n\nDouthat: But from the beginning — again, in the name, from “Lord of the Rings” — you have this idea that you’re building a technology that, in the story the name originates from, is used for good and for evil. I’m just interested in the extent to which that judgment is, more than most companies, woven into the kind of governmental work you’re willing to do.\n\nSankar: It’s very woven into it. I mean, we pick our partners very carefully. We want to work on work that’s important to the West. That includes the commercial work we do in re-industrializing the country.\n\nDouthat: Let’s use that as a way to pivot to your own biography for a minute. Back in June, you were one of four tech executives to be commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves. Why did you do this?\n\nSankar: For a lot of reasons. The primary one is personal: what example am I setting for my children? What did I learn from my father?\n\nSo, you have to go back to how I came to America. My family fled violence in Nigeria when I was a child. Our dog was decapitated, they pistol whipped my father, they threatened my mother, and I was a young child, so I don’t really have direct memories of this. But obviously it was very traumatic for my parents, and we left all of our earthly possessions behind and restarted life in Orlando.\n\nDad was a person who was wildly successful in his 20s, and never really successful again after that. After he came to the U.S., it wasn’t the classic immigrant story. It was a guy who tried to start something, went bankrupt — like, life was always kicking him in the teeth. But he was always so grateful to be here. Life, liberty and possibility.\n\nHe would remind us of the counterfactual: But for the grace of this nation, you’d be dead in a ditch in Lagos — so we always grew up with that deep understanding of this.\n\nI don’t know how useful I really could have been to the military when I was 23, but I think at 43 — 20 years of building Palantir, really learning all the mistakes I made, compounding into actual lessons — I think I can be much more useful. And the opportunity to serve — there were times where my dad really wished I would go to a service academy, but I think what really catalyzed me to push on this is my observation in Israel after Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael is an incredibly technical country. Bountiful resources of technologists. The I.D.F. [Israel Defense Forces] is incredibly skilled. On Oct. 8, they mobilized 300,000 reservists. By definition, all of them were prior service — you know, conscription-based country — and what was their day job? Well, they were mostly technologists, now with 20 years of experience, roughly.\n\nWhen they came back in, they were horrified at the state of technology, which is actually an implicit self-critique. It’s a version of what I just said. Like, yeah, at 20, I knew how to code, but I didn’t know what I was doing, and wow, I would just build these things differently. I would architect them differently.\n\nThe I.D.F. got more modernization done in the four months after Oct. 7 than in the 10 years that I’d worked with them prior.\n\nAs bountiful as technologists are in Israel, we have the world’s best technologists in America. We have uniquely talented people just like that, who today, are outside of defending the nation. We have made voluntary civil military fusion impossible, when our adversaries make it a requirement.\n\nSo it’s great to have some venue to have America’s greatest technologists actually have some opportunity to give back and contribute. The four of us are the first sort of salvo at that, but I think there’s an opportunity to really scale that.\n\nDouthat: What are you doing during that time?\n\nSankar: Each of us have different jobs that align with our skills here. My focus is really on the work force — work force development. I have a personal interest in theory and identifying the heretics that are in the department.\n\nThere’s so many talented green suiters. How do we find them and make sure that they’re in a role that’s big enough for their actual skills? Rank often gets in the way of really getting the right person in the right role, so that’s one piece of it.\n\nThe other piece of it is just actually helping them with how they plan. If you say: look, the Army of 2030 needs to look like this, and I need this many people for all these sorts of skills, we have these emerging roles — then what’s the software infrastructure that allows us to decompose that into: Well, how many people do I need to recruit now? How am I doing against that goal? What’s my pipeline for training and developing them?\n\nThat’s closer to my job jar.\n\nDouthat: Who are the other three who were commissioned with you?\n\nSankar: We have the C.T.O. of Meta, Andrew Bosworth, “Boz”; Bob McGrew, who was the former chief research officer at OpenAI, and before that he was at Palantir for 10 years; and Kevin Weil, who’s the chief product officer of OpenAI.\n\nDouthat: OK. But would you say all of you in different ways are involved in bureaucratic modernization?\n\nSankar: Yeah.\n\nDouthat: Yeah, that’s fair? Do you think there’s any potential tension between your  responsibilities at Palantir, and your responsibilities to the U.S. military?\n\nSankar: Well, I think hopefully everything I’ve learned commercially working with thousands of commercial customers can be repurposed to actually more efficiently deliver solutions here. There’s a reason I’m focused on work that doesn’t overlap with anything else that Palantir does, so there’s no appearance of conflict.\n\nBut, you know, the Army has lots of reservists, and those reservists have day jobs, and the Army has a whole process for managing conflicts and assigning what it is that you can work on based on what is your day job.\n\nDouthat: OK. So there’s someone above you, effectively, in the military chain of command who’s deciding if you’re crossing lines.\n\nSankar: Yes.\n\nDouthat: Do you see any tension between your own personal narrative and family history as an immigrant to the U.S., and the fact that Palantir is working to effectuate mass deportations? I guess, more generally: What is your view of immigration policy based on that biography?\n\nSankar: My own view is that assimilation is important. We came here legally. We believe in America, and that immigration has made this country strong — but legal immigration. There are rules to follow.\n\nAnd it’s even true if you just zoom out. How will you maintain the society where broad parts of the American people feel gaslit by the process? The lack of enforcement breeds nihilism, and that’s not tenable.\n\nDouthat: I agree with that. There is also, though, clearly a conflict or a tension in right-of-center politics right now, between people who take your view and basically say immigration is good for America, but the system we’ve had is a disaster and we need to restore order — and people who say we just have too many immigrants, period, and South Asian immigrants in particular.\n\nLike, I don’t know. Do you see yourself as effectively trying to make immigration policy more credible for the purpose of allowing continued immigration?\n\nSankar: Well, I’ll let that be decided at the ballot box. What I view is the latter thing that you pointed out is a reaction to having no enforcement of the former. It’s easy to go and say that, but when you feel like you’re losing jobs, when you feel like the society’s being torn apart, when you feel like no one’s being responsive, this is what happens.\n\nThis is why I really believe in getting the organizations to be legitimate and to function and work. Otherwise, what is the basis for making policy? It’s really tenuous right now.\n\nDouthat: That seems like an attempt to have a civic nationalist vision from the perspective of corporate America, and I think it’s —\n\nSankar: Well, I’m just speaking from my individual perspective here.\n\nDouthat: I know you’re not offering Palantir’s perspective on immigration policy. But you’re a corporate — I won’t say a corporate titan, but you are a leader of corporate America, so it’s notable to have this civic nationalism expressed, in part because this was not, I think, the dominant mind-set in Silicon Valley in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nFor an extended period of time, I think the tech industry was very much defined by, not a hostility to America, but a kind of post-nationalist, “We’re citizens of the world, we’re serving global culture.” And it certainly was not just true of Silicon Valley. I think it was true of a lot of elite American institutions in ways that contributed to the populist rebellion in the end. And the idea of tech executives serving in the military, I think, is a very concrete shift away from that older perspective.\n\nI don’t think it’s just Palantir where you see that shift. There’s hundreds of tech and A.I. start-ups that are focused on military technology.\n\nSankar: When the four of us got direct commission, between the four of us, maybe a thousand people in the Valley reached out saying, one, this is amazing, and two, how can I get involved?\n\nDouthat: But what do you think is driving this change in attitude overall? Because it seems notable. Like, I lived through Sept. 11. There was some kind of shift after Sept. 11, but it seemed to dissolve pretty quickly. What do you think is happening that makes this kind of mentality more common in Silicon Valley?\n\nSankar: I don’t want to be reductionist about it, but I think you can’t discount the effect of the invasion of Ukraine. It was a moment where people realized all these things they took for granted actually just don’t happen on their own. And that actually, someone can just decide to roll a bunch of tanks across the border and try to change a fundamental reality in the world, and you can’t actually dissuade that without hard power. That perhaps there is still evil in the world, and that evil is not us.\n\nYou could characterize a lot of the malaise of the last 20 years as feeling like, oh, we screwed up in Iraq or Afghanistan, and maybe we’re the problem — and this element of self-loathing that I think Putin’s invasion brought a lot of clarity to and a recognition that these things have to be done well.\n\nDouthat: That’s really interesting, because, again, as with immigration, it seems like there are two very different reactions to the invasion that are present in American politics on the center right in the Trump administration. And one sees it as kind of a continuation of the Iraq–Afghanistan story, where it’s like: Look, here again is another foreign war that Americans are unwisely enmeshed in, and in fact, it’s yet another case study in how we need to effectively retrench — and rebuild — but retrench.\n\nYou’re offering what is in the end, I think, a much more hawkish view of the lessons that the U.S. should take from—\n\nSankar: Well, I’m offering a view of what I think has galvanized Silicon Valley. And certainly, different pockets of America have different reactions to this. I think, though, there is a broader narrative that unfortunately unfolds over many decades that people have lost the plot on. And you could ask, arguably for the last 10 years, we’ve lost deterrence as a nation.\n\nYou look at Crimea in 2014, the militarization of the Spratly Islands by the Chinese in 2015, the breakout capability of Iran on the bomb, and then a pogrom happening in Israel two years ago. So peace is not there right now. That doesn’t mean I’m saying we need to go out and have wars all over the place. But peace comes from deterrence, and we’ve lost deterrence. Now, the national question is: what should we do about that?\n\nMy argument from a builder’s perspective is that a big part of why we’ve lost deterrence is the excesses of having won the Cold War — or I think, more accurately, it should be framed as the Soviets lost the Cold War — and being the sole superpower for some period of time.\n\nIf you really look at what made the industrial base work in World War II and the early Cold War, it wasn’t a defense industrial base — it was an American industrial base. We have kind of whitewashed history to forget that Chrysler built minivans and missiles. Ford built satellites until 1990. General Mills, the cereal company, used to build torpedoes. That American innovative spirit.\n\nNow, the conventional wisdom of this story is that we lost competition in the industrial base. This consolidation just led to fewer players and they became less good at providing it, maybe a little fat and happy.\n\nI don’t think that’s right. I think what actually happened is that you drove out the crazies, and the wild engineering spirit moved out to other parts of our economy, parts of our economy that became disconnected from serving the nation.\n\nThat’s what’s changed in this present moment, whether it’s the invasion of Ukraine — you could say SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril led it before then — interested group of founders and technologists who want to build in the national interest and who have heterodox ideas.\n\nYou need the heretics. The heretics end up being your heroes.\n\nEven the formation of the Air Force was an act of heresy. You had Billy Mitchell, who at the time was part of the Army, and he really pissed off the Navy by showing that you could drop a bomb from an airplane instead of using a boat to do it. He was court-martialed. He died in disgrace.\n\nPosthumously, they created the Air Force. So he didn’t even get to see his heresy become heroism. But he’s the founder of the Air Force, and I think, more than ever in this time, we need our heretics.\n\nDouthat: So is that the fundamental tension in a way, between the new players in the Silicon Valley part of the defense industry, and the old guard? That you are offering yourselves as potential outside builders for things that the existing services prefer to build themselves? Like, what are the tension points?\n\nSankar: Five years ago, that was really a tension point. Famously, Palantir had to sue the Army, not once, but twice, to get the right to compete.\n\nDouthat: And the Army wants to build its own — so this isn’t just about ships. The Army wants to create its own proprietary software.\n\nSankar: Humans want to create their own things.\n\nDouthat: Yes.\n\nSankar: So it’s not like: hey, the Army’s bad, or this service is bad — this is a function of human nature. Our greatest competition in the commercial world is the same thing: It is that institution’s desire to build their own solution, rather than having this foreign object come by — “not invented here” syndrome, people call it. And what is the clarifying way of thinking about this? Well, existential threat.\n\nSo yeah, having won the Cold War, facing no threats, you’re going to go down a long path of indulging in the largesse of building exactly what you want and how you want to do it. There’s no back pressure. There’s no threat that’s going to align you to developing the right thing at the right speed. You know what’s going to empower the heretics there. And I think the world has changed in a way.\n\nThat’s why I say in the present: Five years ago, that was a problem. Now, it’s very different, the amount of heterodox thinking that’s being absorbed.\n\nThe way I often frame it is, the Department of Defense is a monopsony. The Department of War is a monopsony. People are very familiar with monopoly, where you have one seller of a thing, but a monopsony is when you have one buyer of a thing. And a lot of the dysfunction is, that’s the root cause, that you have a single buyer.\n\nYou can think about the great monopsony of the 1990s, Walmart. And what was their tagline? “Everyday low prices.” You can remember the ads where they would roll back the prices. Their strategy was, effectively: We have the distribution. We need to squeeze our suppliers and control prices.\n\nThey didn’t see Amazon coming. This is the problem for the monopsony. You don’t have enough competition to realize what’s actually happening in the marketplace.\n\nDouthat: And competition in this area just takes the form of military conflict?\n\nSankar: Yeah.\n\nDouthat: In the end, or at the very least, the strong threat of military conflict.\n\nSo talk about, from the point of view of the heretics, as much as you can specific to Palantir. What are the changes that would prevent the U.S. from losing the next war?\n\nSankar: Well, I think that A.I. and software is a wonderful asymmetric advantage of the U.S. There are no Indian or Chinese enterprise software companies that are on the world stage. It is a unique strength that we tend to underestimate here.\n\nA.I. is an American phenomenon. Deep Seek would not exist if they had not stolen the model from OpenAI through distillation. Yes, they had clever optimizations, but the fundamentals of it is, this is a phenomenon that’s happening in a small radius around the San Francisco Bay Area. It’s an American phenomenon.\n\nYou’re not going to win the war with software and A.I. It can increase your lethality. At the end of the day, you’re going to have to be able to build things. You’re going to need mass that you can bring to a fight that drives deterrence.\n\nThe analogy I would give you is World War II. The Germans were far better engineers than the Americans. They had really exquisite technology. They just couldn’t build it at any sort of scale. They could build one-off little things here or there.\n\nWhat did we have? We had just incredible manufacturing capability. It even brought awe to Stalin. He couldn’t believe what we were capable of doing. Our things were less sophisticated, but quantity is a quality of its own.\n\nIf you look at the present moment, you might say, that sounds an awful lot like our adversary — so we need a high-low mix. And I think part of this is we have to be able to build these things here again with speed. That’s what the new entrants are really bringing.\n\nI don’t think most people recognize that Gulf War I was a watershed moment for the Chinese. They could not believe how quickly the Americans rolled over the fourth-largest army in the world. Since that happened, they have been systematically investing in countering the key capabilities that enable us to do that, whether it’s in space, whether it’s our Navy.\n\nNow, they’ve had 30 years of thinking about this, developing things that continue to push us back and make our life harder, while we haven’t really been treating them like a pure adversary. So I think we’re not behind, but we could be behind if we continue to believe that we have no competition.\n\nDouthat: But it’s more than that. You’re not just trying to build midlevel military technology at scale. You’re also trying to create new military technology that integrates A.I. especially, right? What is Titan?\n\nSankar: Titan is a project that we have with the U.S. Army. We’re the prime on it, but we’re partnered with Anduril and L3 and Northrop Grumman. It’s a satellite ground station on wheels — that’s how to think about it.\n\nThere are multiple form factors. There’s a truck version of it. But the whole point is to be able to connect soldiers on the ground to national-level intelligence that allows you to do deep sensing that enables long-range precision fires.\n\nDouthat: What is deep sensing?\n\nSankar: Deep sensing is not just what can I see from my truck, but how can I use all the sensors that we have to tell the truck: What can you see?\n\nDouthat: So that is an example of a new form of military technology that did not exist before, that is being designed using the kind of software that you’re involved in—\n\nSankar: I think it becomes feasible. Yeah. I mean, many of the concepts have been around for a while, but what is the unit cost of producing it? How long will it take? How many people will you need to do it, to actually run the software that’s in the truck? Being able to collapse all that down to something that’s survivable, that’s mobile — what would you have done before the truck? You can ask that question.\n\nWell, here’s a question: Why is it even a truck to begin with? Because you need to be mobile. Because if you are static, if you have a big command center, you’re going to get blown up. That’s not survivable. U.S. service members will die.\n\nNow if you can do that same thing, that would’ve taken 400 people in a huge logistical footprint with four people while moving, hopefully they’re going to survive.\n\nDouthat: And how much can you do without people, in a world where part of the future of warfare is drone technology?\n\nSankar: I’m structurally skeptical there.\n\nDouthat: OK.\n\nSankar: That’s where the fantasy goes. Fantasy, terror and fear —\n\nDouthat: Fear and fantasy both. Go on. Tell me your skepticism.\n\nSankar: Actually there’s a fair amount of human judgment required for any of these things. It’s not a simple game constrained by rules. The better way to think about this is what the soldiers need, or uniformed service members need, is an Iron Man suit. Something that gives them much more efficiency, much more effectiveness at doing the job that they’re already trained to do, but is too hard to get done right now. Or if we did it the old way, would not be survivable in a future conflict, and therefore provides no deterrence.\n\nYou know, everything’s not about getting into the next fight. It’s actually building technologies that dissuade the next fight.\n\nDouthat: But why do you need the person inside the Iron Man suit if you could just build the Iron Man robot that has the same capacities?\n\nSankar: I’m not sure you can. First of all, I’m leaving aside just military doctrine, that there’s always going to be a human on the loop. That’s just right how military makes —\n\nDouthat: Well, that’s a related question. So much of the kill chain assumes that you have to have a human being in the loop when you decide to fire a missile or kill someone. That’s the moral side of this. But you’re arguing that practically, you can’t imagine a world where that element is taken out —\n\nSankar: Efficaciously, I just don’t think it would work the way that people think it would work in the Terminator nightmare scenario.\n\nI’ll give you one example. I also think there’s an element of this where it’s more of a difference of degree than kind. So we tend to think about it as, OK, we have these autonomous weapons that are going to be built. Well, if we go back to the ’70s, we have fighter jets with radar that see beyond the horizon, that see things that the human cannot see, that tell you, hey, there’s an enemy aircraft here — OK, so you’re already relying, there’s some belief in the computer seeing that.\n\nThen, assuming you want to engage it, you press a button that releases a missile where the terminal guidance to the target is done by a computer as well. So that kind of sounds like an autonomous weapon. Sounds like we’ve had autonomous weapons since the ’70s.\n\nThere is a kind of sensationalism around the present moment that makes it sound like, hey, this is a difference of kind — and I’m saying it’s a difference of degree, actually, and that, in the context of having a human on the loop, we’re just extending their capabilities.\n\nDouthat: But there are lots of people — maybe not at Palantir, but in Silicon Valley — who think that they are building machines that will be, in some period of time, better than the pilot at making the decision required of them, of when and how to pull the trigger.\n\nThere’s a level of superintelligence that’s possible through A.I. We are racing the Chinese to achieve some level, and that level, like the atomic bomb, gives you this super advantage in military conflict. And in the end, that’s much more of the whole ball game than figuring out the right way to improve our kill chain loops right now.\n\nSankar: I’m super skeptical there.\n\nDouthat: You’re super skeptical.\n\nSankar: Very.\n\nDouthat: Tell me why you’re so skeptical. Give me more.\n\nSankar: Because I think the secularists in Silicon Valley are filling the God-shaped hole in their heart with A.G.I. [artificial general intelligence]. There’s not an empirical basis to believe that such a thing — it’s like: OK, the models get better. Why do you think that this cliff is going to happen where they somehow turn us into house cats?\n\nAnd you see that the people who have religion are the most skeptical of this. The people who are transhumanists — it becomes what they wish were true, and then they run around with the doomerism.\n\nThe doomerism of Silicon Valley is both a fund-raising shtick, where the Frontier Labs can say: My technology is so powerful, it’s going to lead to mass unemployment, so you better invest in me, or you’re going to be poor — and also it’s divorced from any sort of reality. They are sitting in Silicon Valley building these models, spending no time on the front lines of how people are using this.\n\nThat’s exactly my job: being with the I.C.U. nurse in Tampa, or being with the submarine industrial parts manufacturer in New Hampshire. Well, when you see it intersect the frontline, it’s actually empowering the worker to do more. The nurse spends less time collating clinical notes, more time by the bedside of the patient. The submarine parts manufacturer spends less time looking at and analyzing change orders and replanning the work, more time building the parts that actually move the enterprise forward. So there’s a much more subtle reality that is positive and empowering.\n\nI think that the ultimate litmus test is when you ask these frontline workers, not only, hey, how do you feel about your job now that you’re using A.I.? — it’s obviously positive, as you might expect from my description here, much more profoundly than when you ask them: How do you feel about your children’s future in America, given A.I.? — they’re wildly positive.\n\nAnd so how do you square that optimism for the future with the doomerism coming out of the Valley? You know how I square it, which is that they’re living in a bubble, and it happens to be very good for them from a fund-raising perspective.\n\nBut I think it has huge—\n\nDouthat: And may be good for you if it does actually push A.I. further and make—\n\nSankar: Yeah, I want the models to get more powerful. That’s great.\n\nBut the analogy I’d give you, it’s like electricity: just producing electricity is not valuable. You have to actually be able to consume it. The valuable part were the people who built the machine tools that ran on electricity that powered the industrial age. Of course, producing electricity is a precondition to that, but we’re so skewed to one side of this equation — the supply side — we’re not thinking about the demand side in a way that’s productive.\n\nThis is where I do worry about China, because I don’t think they have the same A.G.I. fantasies we do. Their explicit strategy is to be the best at implementing A.I. for economic value. That’s what we should be doing.\n\nDouthat: I’m incredibly sympathetic to that narrative. But then, I have children, I am religious, I’m not a technologist. So there’s limits to my own understanding of A.I. I always worry that I’m overly tempted to under-index on the strong A.G.I. scenarios.\n\nAnd I guess I worry a little bit that you might be tempted for a slightly different reason, which is that — as I keep pressing on — Palantir is in this position of having this incredibly powerful technology that you have to keep making moral and political judgments about: Who do you sell it to? Who do you work with? Who do you trust with this technology? — and it’s in your interest, in a way, to convince yourself that the moral stakes of your work is always going to be somewhat constrained.\n\nBut you’re not worried that you or anyone else is in the position of building Skynet, of building the system that yields true disaster?\n\nSankar: No, I’m not. We’re explicitly not building Skynet. The thing I’d say is — I’d offer a little bit of evidence, which is, for the Frontier Labs to be successful, they’ve all started to have to build software around their models. You can think about ChatGPT as the software interface to a model. You can think of all the coding assistants as software interfaces to the model. And I think in the general public, there’s a lack of clarity of what is the software, and what is the A.I. The more and more advanced uses of this stuff really require better models — sure. But they require more software.\n\nSo, yes, maybe you could say: no conflict, no interest. The facile view of this would be: Well, you’re incentivized to believe it — but I spend every day building things that inform this position.\n\nDouthat: Yeah, no. I’m more likely to trust your sense of things than my own. That’s why I’m interviewing you.\n\nAnd that brings me to my last question for you, which is that in addition to being an officer in the U.S. military and the C.T.O. of Palantir, you are now a would-be Hollywood executive, right?\n\nSankar: That’s right. I’ve started a film production company to make content that makes you proud to be an American. Not Pravda Entertainment, but a lot of this was built on my own assimilation journey.\n\nSo when I came to the U.S. in the early ’80s, I would sit on the couch with Dad and watch “Rambo III” and “Rocky IV” and “Hunt for the Red October” —\n\nDouthat: “War Games” and “Terminator 2”? Just throwing those out there — those two.\n\nSankar: “Star Trek.” I’ll offer you some optimistic sci-fi.\n\nDouthat: Yep, yep.\n\nSankar: But also things that reflect comedy, like “Beverly Hills Cop.” There’s a sense of heroism. It’s not just about war movies. It’s about: what is the American spirit?\n\nI like to say, as a 5-year-old, I knew what it felt like to be an American before I knew civics or our political philosophy or our history, and I think that feeling’s really important. It explains why people went back to the theater to see “Top Gun Maverick” over and over again. Obviously they already knew the plot the second time around, but the feeling is really important.\n\nA lot of our content right now is filled with a little bit of self-loathing, maybe a lot of nihilism — a sense that America’s a force for bad in the world. Sometimes it’s subtle, sometimes it’s not so subtle. We’ve been here before as a country — in Vietnam, essentially. We had a lot of movies that felt this character arc of self-loathing.\n\nIt’s actually the reason that George Lucas made “American Graffiti” in ’73. He was tired of it. He just wanted to make a movie about boys chasing girls driving cars. It was the palate cleanser that set the tone for the big pump-up movies of the late ’70 and ’80s that we’ve just been talking about here.\n\nAnd I think they are really powerful stories to be told. There’s a great opportunity to tell a story on the 25th anniversary of 9/11 that has nothing to do with terrorism or planes flying to the building, per se, but to focus on a very, what I view as a quintessentially American story: the nine everyday New Yorkers who went to work that day and were courageous. They motivated each other to get 12,000 souls out of that building in the 102 minutes between the first strike and the towers collapsing. All of our narratives of this tend to focus on the 2,000 or so folks we lost, which is a grave tragedy, but even in our worst moment, that’s the best of us.\n\nWhat is it that we want to communicate to our children that being American means? I think that’s really important.\n\nDouthat: All right, on that patriotic note: Shyam Sankar, thanks so much for joining me.\n\nSankar: Thanks for having me, Ross.\n\nThoughts?

Become Too Scary?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-29T05:02:27-04:00\n\nOn a recent Sunday evening, Melanie Parker took her 2-year-old to the Ditmas Park section of Brooklyn to see a house in the area known for its elaborate Halloween displays. “He loves classic Halloween imagery — pumpkins, witches, ghosts, spiders and skeletons,” Ms. Parker, 38, a full-time caregiver who lives with her partner in Crown Heights, said of her son.\n\nAdorning the home, though, was “a ton of blood” as well as “dismembered bodies, like a child’s head,” she said. “They were all moving and speaking and gesturing and making noises.” The decorations were illuminated in a way that made many of the figures — and wounds — appear more lifelike, she added.\n\nSince then, her son “keeps talking about the guy who broke his head and the people who were hurt. Our kid was both riveted and disturbed.”\n\nBeing a little spooked is part of the delight of Halloween. But lately, some say genuine jump scares are abundant — on stoops and front lawns, looming in doorways and hanging from rafters — as household decorations seem to have become more gory, more violent and unsettlingly realistic.\n\nIt has caused neighbors to lodge complaints, and others to wonder about the twisted impulses that may be lurking in the collective American psyche.\n\n“It bothers me because I think it says something about the character of our culture,” said Regina Musicaro, a licensed clinical psychologist who practices in New York City and specializes in trauma. “It feels what is being prioritized is being the most outrageous, and I think we need some self-imposed restraints on what we put out there because it reflects our thoughtfulness.”\n\nThe subtle shift might have begun with Skelly, the 12-foot skeleton with light-up eyes that Home Depot introduced in 2020. Over the last few years, it has become a must-have item, even with its $300 price tag.\n\nThis year, Home Depot has released some new, spookier decorations, like a five-foot-tall skeleton dog. “The dog piece was actually designed to be a scarier version of last year’s Skelly Dog, based on customer feedback that it wasn’t quite spooky enough,” Aubrey Horowitz, merchant of decorative holiday at the Home Depot, wrote in an email. “Since everyone’s definition of scary is different, we strive to offer a balance.”\n\nTom Arnold, a finance professor and retail expert at the University of Richmond, said Halloween decorations had become more realistic because of improved technology and more popular because of the capacity to mass produce them at a lower price point.\n\nHalloween has also become a bigger spending holiday — according to the National Retail Federation, spending on decorations alone is expected to reach $4.2 billion this year, up from $1.6 billion in 2019 — and a more adult one.\n\n“One way to think of it is if a store is dedicated 100 square feet to children, they are adding another 50 square feet for adults,” he said. “More adults seem to be getting into Halloween.”\n\nDo adults participating in the fanfare still have an obligation to keep things kid-friendly? And then there’s a larger question about social responsibility. Is it a parent’s job to protect children from seeing scary things, or should the entire neighborhood pitch in?\n\n“I would probably say it’s our responsibility to make sure our son doesn’t see things that could scare him,” Ms. Parker said. But, she continued, “I know I don’t have total — maybe not even partial — control over what he sees out in the world.”\n\nCabot Phillips, 31, a reporter on a conservative news podcast who lives in a suburb of Nashville, has started walking two blocks out of his way to get to the playground with his 18-month-old son to avoid one house.\n\n“There is an inflatable four-foot-long demo zombie baby with blood all over his face and creepy veins, and it looks possessed,” he said. “Initially, I would walk next to the stroller so my son couldn’t see it, but now I am taking a different path.”\n\nHe said he thought his homeowner’s association should take up a discussion about the décor. “People in the neighborhood can decide together what is too far for them,” he said.\n\nNot all the protests are on the behalf of children. Adults say they have been rattled by decorations in their neighborhood, too, and some say they have been distracted while driving or felt jumpy when walking home at night.\n\nThis year, Julia Arenson, 58, a yoga instructor and doula who lives in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, has noticed many houses in her neighborhood displaying Skelly, the 12-foot skeleton from Home Depot. “It’s like an overabundance of large skeletons standing there lording over brownstones,” she said.\n\n“There is a lot of instability in the world right now and in our country, and I really feel like it is being reflected in all the décor, all these stark skeletal remains,” she said.\n\nMaybe those types of decorations were always there, she added, but she just hadn’t noticed them as much before.\n\n“I would like to see some googly eyes or some funny witches,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/trump-heaven-legacy.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:03:22-04:00","title":"Trump’s Search for Eternity: Heaven?

Maybe Not, He Says. Monuments? Absolutely.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T05:03:22-04:00\n\nA few weeks ago, President Trump momentarily dropped the bombast and the playground insults and the self-congratulation to muse about his eternal soul. “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible,” he said. “I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.”\n\nProdded by a reporter this month to elaborate, he repeated the lament without much more explanation. “I’m being a little cute,” he said. But he went on: “I don’t think there’s anything that’s going to get me into heaven. I think I’m not maybe heaven-bound.”\n\nMr. Trump is hardly the first 79-year-old to dwell on what may come after he departs this mortal coil — or to wonder whether he has earned entry into the pearly gates. But it is so unlike Mr. Trump to express self-doubt that his public rumination has raised questions. What is on his mind lately that makes him fear his fate in the hereafter? What sins might he be regretting?\n\nHe has not clarified his thinking, at least not on camera, nor for that matter has he shown any public signs of repentance for scandals that he may believe hold him back from grace. And yet the president’s curious contemplation comes at a time when Mr. Trump seems to be seeking a form of immortality. If absolution is out of reach, perhaps there are more achievable ways of living beyond his natural time on this earth.\n\nAnd so, the man who over a long career in business slapped his name on buildings around the world now seems intent on leaving his mark in even more grandiose fashion. He demolished the East Wing of the White House last week to make way for a vast, gilded Trumpian ballroom. He wants to erect an arch at the entrance to Washington that resembles Napoleon’s Arc de Triomphe. He is even considering having the government issue a new $1 coin with his own face on it, something no president has done in nearly a century.\n\nHis allies have gotten into the game, too. Republican members of Congress have introduced bills to rename the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts or Washington Dulles International Airport after Mr. Trump. Another measure submitted in the House would add Mr. Trump’s visage to Mount Rushmore alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, an ambition that Mr. Trump expressed in his first term.\n\nPresumably none of that would provide a speed pass to paradise, but it might help satisfy Mr. Trump’s craving for glory that will outlast his time in office. As it is, his on-again, off-again flirtation with the idea of running for an unconstitutional third term makes clear his reluctance to cede the stage. All presidents want to leave a legacy once they do depart, historical and often physical — see Barack Obama’s new towering presidential library rising in Chicago, called the “Obamalisk.”\n\nBut none in modern times have gone to the lengths that Mr. Trump has to put his personal stamp on national landmarks. And the two times he talked about heaven recently came in the context of the cease-fire that he brokered in Gaza and his efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine, in effect offering those as his argument for salvation.\n\n“Trump is trying to figure out The Art of the Heavenly Deal,” said Peter H. Wehner, a former White House adviser to President George W. Bush who has written extensively on religion and politics. “Trump is hoping he can convince God that he deserves a place in the Holy of Holies. God, not Trump, will be the ultimate judge of that. That’s true for Trump, and it’s true for all of us.”\n\nThe challenge for the president, Mr. Wehner added, is that his usual methods for getting his way are not particularly suited to Judgment Day. “Trump can’t weaponize the federal government against God,” Mr. Wehner said. “He can’t force God to sign an N.D.A. He can’t cut off federal funding to God” or “intimidate God into silence, or threaten God with a primary challenge, or threaten God with a lawsuit.”\n\nAides have not explained Mr. Trump’s thinking but said he was building a record as president to be proud of. “President Trump’s legacy will be remembered across the world for all of history as the peace president,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in response to questions.\n\n“President Trump,” she added, “has brought hostages home, ended numerous wars, stopped human trafficking and drug smuggling across our border” and created a faith office in the White House and a religious liberty commission.\n\nHe has also done things — by his own admission or the findings of courts — that would violate at least some of the Ten Commandments, including adultery, lying, taking the Lord’s name in vain and, if one counts business fraud, stealing. Nor is he a stranger to most of the seven deadly sins: pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth. His critics point to a civil verdict of sexual abuse, a criminal conviction stemming from covering up hush money payments to a porn star, his self-enrichment in office and his degrading treatment of God’s other children, including immigrants.\n\nMr. Trump’s musings about the afterlife come at a time when he has been testing the thou-shalt-not-kill commandment by ordering deadly strikes without due process or substantive legal justification against alleged drug smugglers posing no imminent threat. Nearly every modern president, of course, has authorized deadly force at some point, although many legal experts contend that killing civilians, even criminals, without trial stretches if not breaks the bounds of law. Mr. Trump argues that the suspected drug runners are the equivalent of enemy soldiers in wartime.\n\nIt might not be surprising for a man nearing the end of his eighth decade to be taking stock. But it is surprising for Mr. Trump, who rarely engages in the kind of public introspection that would entertain doubt about his worthiness for heaven.\n\n“Trump’s statement is surprising, if not shocking, given the hubris he often displays and his desire to be thought of highly by Christians, especially evangelicals,” said Gary Scott Smith, a professor emeritus of history at Grove City College and the author of books on presidents and religion. “While other presidents may have ruminated about this issue privately, I am not aware of any of them making a public statement questioning whether they will go to heaven.”\n\nMr. Trump rarely goes to church, rarely quotes Scripture, rarely cites religion as a force in his life. Yet he has become a favorite of many religious conservatives, who see him as a vessel for achieving important goals, notably the appointment of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nHe has increasingly cast himself as a figure saved for a purpose by God from two assassination attempts last year, including one in Butler, Pa., where a bullet came perhaps an inch or so from ending his life. In speeches and fund-raising appeals, Mr. Trump has framed his second term as a divinely inspired mission. Now he is sending fund-raising appeals quoting his line about wanting to get into heaven.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump’s religious supporters see the president’s recent musings as evidence that he is wrestling with the same existential questions that confront many people, particularly late in life.\n\n“I think it’s admirable that the president of the United States is thinking about where he will spend eternity — every American should care about that,” said Robert Jeffress, the Dallas evangelical pastor who has spent time with Mr. Trump at the White House. “Furthermore, when he indicates doubt that he may be going there, I believe that he is demonstrating a humility we should all have about our unworthiness.”\n\nMr. Jeffress said he is convinced that the president is a religious man. “I know that he has heard the gospel message since he was a boy listening to Billy Graham that our salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ and not by our works,” Mr. Jeffress said.\n\nChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, traces the president’s faith to his upbringing, which was heavily influenced by Norman Vincent Peale, the religious figure known for “The Power of Positive Thinking,” a popular best seller.\n\n“Peale was the ultimate prosperity gospel Calvinist,” Mr. Ruddy said. “Trump himself reflects that worldview to an amazing degree. Peale was very much focused on success in this life. No surprise to me that Donald Trump doesn’t spend much time thinking about the next.”\n\nAs Mr. Jeffress alluded to, many religious figures have suggested that Mr. Trump’s latest talk misses the point. His framing of the question belies the belief of many Christians that entry into heaven depends primarily on a profession of faith in Christ as their Lord and Savior, not on a simple scorecard of good deeds versus bad deeds.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is a transactional man. His son Eric Trump told the podcaster Benny Johnson that the president may be “too humble to say” that he is going to heaven, but his work to end wars will get him there. “He stopped the death and destruction around the world,” Eric Trump said. “I’ve personally witnessed him stop wars.” He added, “And that in itself will get my father into heaven.”\n\nWhatever his eventual destination, Mr. Trump lately has moved to make sure he is not forgotten in Washington after he is gone. The new 90,000-square-foot ballroom that he wants to add to the White House — nearly twice as large as the mansion itself — is just the latest change he made after paving over the Rose Garden lawn and adding gold trim throughout the Oval Office and Cabinet Room.\n\nAfter ABC News reported that officials were already calling the planned addition the “President Donald J. Trump Presidential Ballroom,” the president dismissed that as “fake news.” He added, “I don’t have any plan to call it after myself.”\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine his objecting if everyone else calls it that.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/climate/candy-chocolate-cocoa-prices-climate-change.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:57:22-04:00","title":"Why Did My Favorite Candy Bar Drop ‘Milk Chocolate’ From the Label?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chocolate candy brands like Almond Joy, Mr. Goodbar, and Rolo have removed 'milk chocolate' from their labels due to rising cocoa prices driven by climate change in West Africa.

Why Did My Favorite Candy Bar Drop ‘Milk Chocolate’ From the Label?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T06:57:22-04:00\n\nAlmost no one noticed when, sometime over the last few years, the packaging on Almond Joy, Mr. Goodbar and Rolo was updated to remove the words “milk chocolate.”\n\nThe edits were easy to miss: The description on the front of the Mr. Goodbar wrapper changed from “milk chocolate with peanuts” to “chocolate candy with peanuts.” Almond Joy is now marketed as a “coconut and almond chocolate candy bar.” Rolos are now wrapped in “rich chocolate candy” instead of “milk chocolate.”\n\nI realized this earlier this year after eating a disappointing chocolate bar. It wasn’t spoiled, it just didn’t taste like I remembered. As a reporter who covers the climate, I’d read about global warming contributing to drought in West Africa and sending cocoa prices through the roof, and I knew candy companies had raised prices and shrunk portions.\n\nBut could it be that they were also tinkering with the makeup of the candy itself?\n\nYes, it turns out. Experts say high cocoa prices have triggered a wave of “reformulations,” the industry term for recipe changes. As the Halloween season boosts demand, some candy companies are replacing expensive cocoa butter with other fats, a swap that means their products no longer meet the U.S. regulatory definition of milk chocolate and can no longer be called that on packaging.\n\nThat’s why milk chocolate (a Food and Drug Administration-regulated term) has become chocolate candy. And these are just the most extreme examples. Armed with the latest confectionary techniques, candy scientists work hard to find reformulations that slip below the threshold for a mandatory label change. These might go undetected outside the industry and the tight-knit world of super-taster candy scientists.\n\nSquint a little, and this is a success story: As shifting weather patterns make some ingredients more scarce, the food industry has deployed its multimillion-dollar research and development budget to adjust to major shifts in agriculture.With little notice, evidence of the world’s changing climate has already sneaked into our sweets.\n\nIn recent years, longer droughts, extreme heat and irregular rainfall patterns have suppressed cocoa yields in West Africa, the crop’s primary growing region. An infection carried by mealybugs has also spread rapidly. Financial speculators, the threat of tariffs, labor issues and other geopolitical factors have compounded the problems.\n\nIn February, the nonprofit research group Climate Central published a study that found climate change had brought six additional weeks of extreme heat to most West African growing regions per year over the last decade, suppressing crop productivity.\n\nThe result of all the recent upheaval in the cocoa market is that prices have shot upward, reaching a peak of more than $10,000 per ton at the end of last year, roughly four times the price in 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\n“When climate change bumps into structural problems and disease,” said Judy Ganes, a food industry consultant, “then prices go up and manufacturers are hesitant to pass through price increases and hurt their sales. Either consumers find something else or they try to reformulate.”\n\nFood industry executives have openly acknowledged the trend of cutting down on cocoa ingredients to save money, but when it comes to answering questions about changes in their own recipes, they’re far more circumspect.\n\nAsked about reformulations in a February earnings call, Steve Voskuil, Hershey’s chief financial officer said “it’s a place we look at, we test, and in some parts of our portfolio, over time we’ve made some changes,” and added that “there’s been no consumer impact whatsoever.”\n\nThe same month, Nestlé told investors it had saved more than $500 million through recipe reformulations as it shared a slide showing high cocoa and coffee prices. When I asked Nestlé for more detail, a spokesperson said candy made up a small portion of the cost savings and that much of it came from addressing “recipe complexity” and “harmonizing recipes” from different brands.\n\nSo how can you tell when your favorite candy changes? I compared current labels on the packages of Mr. Goodbar, Rolo caramels, and Almond Joy with past ingredient lists using the crowdsourced database Open Food Facts, a U.S. Department of Agriculture ingredient database, and data compiled by Richard Hartel, a food science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who each year writes down ingredients in common chocolate bars for one of his classes.\n\n(My process also involved a few trips to the grocery store, where I spent an inordinate amount of time squinting at the small print on Halloween candy variety packs.)\n\nAccording to the databases, Rolo and Mr. Goodbar have changed since 2023, and Almond Joy seems to have changed sometime between 2020 and 2022. The Hershey Company, which makes all three candies, declined to comment. (Mr. Goodbar was also not technically milk chocolate for a handful of years starting in 2008, before it apparently switched back.)\n\nBut comparing labels can only tell enterprising candy lovers so much. Food scientists say they’re trained to tweak recipes in a manner that evades consumer detection.\n\nMichelle Frame, founder of the candy development company Victus Ars, was the first person to develop flavored Peeps, an achievement that helped land her in the Candy Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the last year or so, Ms. Frame has noticed changes creeping into her life outside the laboratory. The milk chocolate coating on a Snickers bar she bought seemed thinner than it used to be. She stopped buying a favorite store-bought chocolate chip cookie after she noticed large chocolate chips had been replaced with a lower-quality substitute. (A Mars spokeswoman said Snickers coatings have not changed since 2019, when the candy’s coatings were reduced by a small amount.)\n\nMs. Frame said a common approach to reducing cocoa costs was to replace chocolate coating with compound coating, which is made with vegetable fats instead of cocoa butter. Some candy bars, like Butterfinger and Baby Ruth, have been made with compound coatings for years. Others, like Almond Joy, have changed more recently.\n\nFor candies without coatings, reformulation can be tricker. Candy makers have begun experimenting with realistic substitutes for cocoa butter. Dr. Hartel called this problem “a food scientist’s delight” because replicating cocoa butter’s precise texture and mouth feel is so complicated. It’s also a big business.\n\nOne of the most obvious substitution tells, he added, is the use of the word “chocolatey” on packaging.\n\nCargill, which sells ingredients to other companies, has noted an uptick in interest in chocolate alternatives, said John Satumba, the company’s director of global edible oil solutions research and development. Cargill has invested  $35 million in a facility in the Netherlands that makes coatings and fillings using less cocoa, and is building a facility in Ohio to manufacture chocolate substitutes.\n\nGlobally, the company has invested $70 million in “cocoa butter equivalent capabilities.”\n\nAnother method is to replace chocolate with existing ingredients like sugar or chunky add-ins. Andrew Moriarty, senior cocoa analyst at Expana, a company that reports agricultural commodity prices, said this had resulted in the reversal of a long-term trend. Companies had been cutting back on added sugars over the last 10 years or so in response to consumer preferences, but sugar content has been quietly ticking upward more recently again as it replaces cocoa.\n\nElsewhere, a company might thin out a milk chocolate coating and slip a layer of chocolate compound beneath it. Cookie makers might shrink their chocolate chips, or use fewer, or mix in a combination of “real” and compound chocolate chips, Ms. Frame said.\n\nShoppers rarely notice these sleights of hand, but industry insiders tell a different story.\n\n“We all know each other and we run around behind the scenes and we’re like, can you believe this stuff?” said Eric Schmoyer, technical innovations director at IRCA Group, a chocolate manufacturer.\n\nCocoa prices have come down some since their peak last winter, but analysts predict the supply crunch is here to stay as the planet warms. Demand for chocolate continues to increase, and expanding production takes time. Climate change is expected to stress crops with hotter days and shifting rainfall patterns, but new plantings may be limited by regulations prohibiting deforestation, Mr. Moriarty said.\n\nIn the long run, Dr. Hartel predicts, the chocolate market will split further in response to these pressures: High-end chocolate will most likely continue to be made with the same ingredients and people will continue to pay more and more for it. Companies will continue to look for ways to keep lower-quality chocolates affordable, whether it be through reformulations, shrinking packages or marketing new products that contain less cocoa.\n\nThis last strategy is evident this Halloween season. A Hershey’s Halloween assortment currently on the market includes light-green Kit Kats and Cookies ‘n’ Creme Fangs, neither of which contain any chocolate at all.\n\nSo what happened with the bad chocolate bar that sent me on this journey? I compared product labels and found no changes over five years. Still, plenty else could have been tweaked, the candy scientists told me: The company might have sourced beans from a different region, or compromised with lower-quality beans, or hired a different manufacturer.\n\nOver the last several years, there have been no shortage of scary headlines about the ways the food system could transform as the world gets warmer, making some key crops less nutritious, trigging severe food shortages and widespread hunger. But there are also subtle shifts that have already landed on our plates, and masking them has become both possible and profitable.\n\nThe future may taste like my chocolate bar: A little worse in a hard-to-define way, whether it was made with different beans, less cocoa butter, or more sugar.\n\nThen again, maybe it was just stale.\n\nMira Rojanasakul contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/us/politics/karine-jean-pierre-book.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"17:38:29-04:00","title":"Karine Jean-Pierre and a Book Tour Most Authors Would Not Dream Of","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Karine Jean-Pierre, the first Black and openly gay White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, has drawn widespread criticism for her book 'Independent,' which argues that she left the Biden administration due to internal Democratic Party tensions over the 2024 campaign.

But that has not been evident this week for Karine Jean-Pierre, whose publicity tour for “Independent,” her book about her time behind the briefing room lectern of the Biden White House, has gone viral, and not in a good way.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that the adage that all publicity is good publicity will prove true and result in spectacular sales for her book, subtitled “A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines.”\n\nBut so far Ms. Jean-Pierre, who as Mr. Biden’s press secretary relied heavily on talking points although without the insults from the podium common today, has come across in interviews as erratic and defensive rather than as a forceful champion for her old boss.\n\nHer attempts to defend him have come at a difficult time for Democrats, who are not eager to revisit the debacle of last year. Her message has not been well received.\n\nAlong the way she has struggled to answer questions. Exhibit A was an interview published on Monday with Isaac Chotiner of The New Yorker, which has been described as “an absolute train wreck” (New York magazine) and “an excruciating case study in denial” (Peter Meijer, a former Republican congressman from Michigan). Others termed it embarrassing and incoherent.\n\nIn the book, Ms. Jean-Pierre writes that she became an independent in June because she was upset by the way the Democratic Party had pushed former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. out of the 2024 race. But in her interview with Mr. Chotiner, her explanation of her thinking devolved into a word salad that left him, and many readers, perplexed.\n\nAsked why she thought the party had given Mr. Biden the boot, Ms. Jean-Pierre, the first Black and openly gay White House press secretary, responded: “There’s more to this than just that period of time. This is very layered, right? There’s a period of time that I questioned what was happening and how do we treat our own, how do we treat people who are decent people? And then you also have to think about how I’m thinking about this as a Black woman who is part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and living in this time where I also don’t think Democrats right now, Democrats’ leadership, is protecting vulnerable people in the way that it should.”\n\n“Sorry, I’m not trying to be dense,” Mr. Chotiner responded. “I’m a little unclear about what this has to do with Democratic leaders and many Democrats in the country thinking that Joe Biden was going to lose to Donald Trump.”\n\nAt another point in the interview, Mr. Chotiner asked Ms. Jean-Pierre why she had written in the book that it was an “insult” to former Vice President Kamala Harris that people didn’t want her to be the nominee when she also wrote that “the truth was, I never really believed Harris could win.”\n\nMs. Jean-Pierre responded: “But two things could be true, right? The thing I say the second time actually proves the thing that I said the first time, right?”\n\nMs. Jean-Pierre’s publicists said she was not available for an interview on Wednesday, but offered a statement from her that said in part: “The focus of my book, ‘Independent,’ is to start a conversation about how we move forward as a country, how we preserve our democracy and fix a broken system that if not attended to will lead us into what some are already calling an authoritarian regime.’’\n\nMs. Jean-Pierre, who was the senior adviser and national spokeswoman for Moveon.org and a political analyst for MSNBC before becoming a White House press secretary, made a big splash when she assumed the job. She appeared in a spread in Vogue, received effusive coverage in the gay press (“7 Times White House’s Karine Jean-Pierre Was a Total Badass,” read a headline in The Advocate) and projected the image of a fresh new personality behind the White House podium.\n\nIn her statement, she said that “while I understand there are some who want to distract from this important conversation by discussing my performance as White House press secretary — and whether I deserved to be in the role — rather than about my book, I won’t be distracted by that chatter.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Chotiner declined to speak about the substance of the New Yorker interview. But he did offer a few words about the general chemistry of his Q&A with Ms. Jean-Pierre, which was done over the phone.\n\n“It wasn’t a tense interview to conduct,” he said. “And she seemed very nice.”\n\nReporters who covered the Biden White House often described Ms. Jean-Pierre as a pleasant person who treated them with respect, but they also said there had been moments when she had not seemed fully informed by her colleagues on policy or major decisions. Her performance at times raised questions about whether she was emblematic of the Biden administration’s problems rather than anything resembling a solution to them.\n\nAfter the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Ms. Jean-Pierre often shared the podium with John F. Kirby. A retired Navy admiral who had worked at the Pentagon and State Department, Mr. Kirby was far more comfortable and better versed in foreign affairs than Ms. Jean-Pierre, who resented the intrusion. In her book, she writes that an unnamed White House official — widely considered to be Anita Dunn — tried to push her aside, and that she wanted an unnamed man who had experience in war-torn regions — presumably Mr. Kirby — to go on a trip to Israel in her place.\n\nIn another interview, last week, Gayle King of “CBS Mornings” was openly skeptical of Ms. Jean-Pierre for writing that she had never seen signs of Mr. Biden’s decline. “You even write, Karine, that you were on the plane with him going to the debate, and you didn’t see anything,” Ms. King said, referring to Mr. Biden’s halting, fumbling debate performance with Donald Trump in June 2024 that led to Mr. Biden’s withdrawal from the race three and a half weeks later.\n\nMs. Jean-Pierre responded that she had not happened to see Mr. Biden on the flight. “With age comes what happens when you get older,” she said, adding that “I never saw anyone who wasn’t there. I saw someone who was always engaged.”\n\nIn another curious moment in Ms. Jean-Pierre’s interview with Mr. Chotiner, she said that her subtitle about a “broken White House” referred to the Trump White House, not the one she had worked in. “The book for me is really about the moment that we’re in,” she said.\n\nAt another point she told Mr. Chotiner that “you’re telling me about the feelings of Joe Biden, blah, blah, blah, but Joe Biden is out of the picture. He’s out of the picture.”\n\n“Yeah, he sure is,” Mr. Chotiner responded.\n\nKitty Bennett contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/business/a-month-without-data-muddles-the-economic-picture.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:04:43-04:00","title":"A Month Without Data Muddles the Economic Picture","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is experiencing a government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, resulting in a complete halt to the collection and release of official economic data—marking the longest economic data blackout in history.

Picture\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T05:04:43-04:00\n\nTariffs are at their highest rates in decades. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going without paychecks. Artificial intelligence is threatening to reshape the American work force.\n\nThe effect all of that is having on the U.S. economy at the moment is impossible to know.\n\nThe United States is a month into a government shutdown that has hobbled the nation’s statistical agencies and created the longest economic data blackout in history. The normally steady flow of government data on hiring, spending, wages, prices and other areas has slowed to a trickle, leaving economists to try to fill in the gaps using anecdotes and a mélange of incomplete and often contradictory indicators from private sources.\n\nThere is no good time to go without reliable data. But this might be a uniquely bad one. Job growth slowed sharply over the summer, leading to fears that the labor market could be taking a rapid turn for the worse. Such a development would most likely draw a swift response from officials at the Federal Reserve, who are responsible for maximizing employment while keeping inflation stable. But policymakers have no reliable way of knowing whether those trends continued into the fall, or perhaps reversed.\n\nTara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, likened the situation to driving down a road in a heavy fog.\n\n“Until something comes along in front of you, or until the road curves, you might be OK,” she said. “But at some point, there will be something in front of you, or the road will curve, and we don’t know when that will be.”\n\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, used the same analogy on Wednesday, acknowledging that the lack of data is exacerbating an already difficult situation for policymakers who are weighing the risk of a softening labor market against still-stubborn inflation. The central bank lowered interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter point for the second time this year. But in a sign of the deep divisions on the committee, two officials dissented in opposite directions — one calling for a larger cut, and one for no cut at all.\n\nEven before the data went dark, President Trump’s ever-changing policies on trade and immigration were making it hard for forecasters to figure out where the economy was headed and for policymakers to agree on the best way to respond. The shutdown has introduced yet another source of economic upheaval, especially as it drags on with little end in sight. Many federal workers missed their first full paycheck this week, and 42 million people are at risk of losing nutrition benefits beginning Saturday.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Mr. Powell on Wednesday cast doubt on the possibility of another interest rate cut at the Fed’s final meeting of the year in December. He said it was “far from” a foregone conclusion given that there were “strongly differing views” about how to proceed. Mr. Powell also emphasized that the lapse in data related to the shutdown could in theory encourage the Fed to stand pat.\n\n“If there is a very high level of uncertainty, then that could be an argument in favor of caution about moving,” he said at a news conference after the Fed’s two-day policy meeting.\n\nBefore that meeting, policymakers caught a lucky break. Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released inflation data for September because it was needed to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits.\n\nBut the fog will get thicker from here. The statistical agency was able to release the September inflation report because the underlying data had been collected before the government shut down on Oct. 1. But it hasn’t collected any new data since then. The White House said last week that the government might not be able to release an October inflation report at all. Reports on the job market, consumer spending, manufacturing and other topics are also in jeopardy.\n\n“We will forever have a question mark about what’s going on right now,” said Karen Dynan, a Harvard economist who was a senior official at the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama. “We can’t go back and recreate accurate estimates.”\n\nEven when the government reopens, it will take time to restart the data engine. That means that when Fed officials gather for their next meeting, on Dec. 9-10, they may have little more information on the state of the economy than they did this week.\n\nIt isn’t just the Fed that is being left in the dark. Corporate executives are trying to forecast their sales as they decide where and whether to expand their businesses. Investors are trying to assess the impact of tariffs, artificial intelligence and other forces on corporate profits and government revenues. State and local officials are trying to figure out how the shutdown is affecting their local economies.\n\nIn the absence of official statistics, economists are turning to data from the private sector. Those sources have multiplied in recent years, particularly after the coronavirus pandemic led to a surge in demand for new economic measures.\n\nEconomists say those sources can be valuable, providing data that is more timely or more granular than what the government can offer. But they leave large gaps. For example, there is hardly any reliable private-sector data on the price of services — a broad category that includes medical procedures, haircuts and interior decorating. And no private source could even begin to provide an estimate of a comprehensive measure like gross domestic product, which attempts to capture the value of all goods and services produced in the country.\n\n“It gets us part of the way, but it doesn’t tell us what policymakers and businesses need to know,” said Jed Kolko, who oversaw economic data at the Commerce Department during the Biden administration. “And the longer we lack official statistics, the greater the risk that private-sector data starts pointing the wrong direction.”\n\nEven in areas where private data is more widely available, like consumer spending and the labor market, the sources are a supplement to government statistics, not a replacement. Most private data series have been around for only a few years, not the decades covered by government sources. And even the largest private companies lack a comprehensive view of the U.S. economy.\n\nThat is a particular problem right now, when Mr. Trump’s policies are affecting different regions, industries and demographic groups in different ways. A retailer that sells primarily to lower-income Hispanic customers will have a starkly different view of the economy right now than one that targets more affluent consumers.\n\nPerhaps as a result, different sources are telling conflicting stories about the health of the economy. The Johnson Redbook Index, a longstanding measure of same-store retail sales, suggests that consumer spending continued to grow at a healthy rate this fall. But a measure of debit card transactions published by Bloomberg shows a more worrying slowdown.\n\nSimilarly, ADP, the payroll processor, reported that private employers cut jobs in September, although a new weekly series from the company shows a modest rebound in early October. But other sources, including one from Revelio Labs, a labor market data company, suggest that hiring has cooled but not stopped. States have also continued to release data on applications for unemployment benefits, which have risen only modestly.\n\n“We have gotten private-sector data that suggest the labor market is slowing down, that suggest the labor market is slowing down in a worrying way, and that suggest that the labor market might really be in trouble,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale. “I don’t know which one of those is right.”\n\nThe conflicting signals are particularly concerning for economists because, historically, when the labor market has deteriorated, it has often done so quickly. In 2008, for example, the unemployment rate held mostly steady in the spring, then rose rapidly to 6.1 percent in August from 5 percent in April. If a similar spiral were to happen now, policymakers might not know until it was too late to prevent significant damage.\n\n“The economy turns, and you can’t tell it’s turning by just looking out your window,” Ms. Dynan said. “I don’t think it’s impossible that when the data tap is turned back on, we’ll see something happened in the economy that would have warranted a serious policy response.”\n\nSome economists argued that policymakers would be able to pick up on a drastic downturn in the labor market even without government data. But a more subtle shift could be harder to detect. What makes the situation all the more difficult is that Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown has pushed foreign-born workers out of the labor force — or out of the country entirely — and discouraged new people from entering the country. The resulting decline in the growth of the labor force has made it hard to know what a healthy pace of monthly jobs growth now looks like.\n\n“I don’t think a really bad economy can hide,” said Wendy Edelberg, an economist at the Brookings Institution. “I do think that an economy that’s turning bad can hide.”\n\nMr. Powell echoed that point on Wednesday, saying that “if there were a significant or material change in the economy one way or another, I think we would pick that up through this.”\n\nBut having a partial view of the economy at a highly uncertain moment increases the risk that the Fed will make a mistake, either by cutting interest rates too quickly and allowing inflation to pick back up or by moving too slowly, resulting in rising unemployment. Mr. Powell suggested that officials had different views about which mistake was more costly, helping to explain why divisions have sharpened about what to do next.\n\n“The division is going to get a lot worse,” said David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura. He noted that in September, a sizable group of Fed officials had already indicated they would not want to cut interest rates again this year.\n\nAuthoritative data might have helped resolve the dispute, said Anil Kashyap, a University of Chicago economist who has served as an adviser to central banks in several countries. Without it, policymakers are more likely to trust the sources that support their existing positions, he said.\n\n“If you’ve got a divided committee where there’s differences of opinion, often the data is kind of the tiebreaker,” Mr. Kashyap said.\n\nBut the Fed may not have that luxury. Mr. Powell said on Wednesday that he hoped to have the relevant data in hand by the December meeting, but lawmakers do not appear close to a deal to fund the government.\n\n“What do you do if you’re driving in the fog?” Mr. Powell asked rhetorically. “You slow down.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/arts/television/late-night-south-korea-trump-crown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"01:57:42-04:00","title":"Late Night Shades South Korea for Giving Trump a Crown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During President Trump’s visit to South Korea, he was presented with a replica gold crown, which sparked widespread satire on late-night television.

Agree to a Yearlong Trade Truce\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T07:12:42-04:00\n\nPresident Trump and Xi Jinping struck a deal this morning in their first meeting since Trump opened a trade war against China. Xi agreed to postpone controls on critical rare earth minerals, Trump said. Trump also said the U.S. would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods. It’s, in effect, a yearlong truce in the countries’ intense economic feud.\n\nThe deal came after a threat Trump made this morning on social media as he was arriving in Busan, South Korea, to meet with Xi: He said the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nTrump’s post heightened the stakes of an already fraught conversation on trade, and the mood was tense when Trump arrived. The leaders shook hands, then Trump did all of the talking about striking a deal. Xi was silent.\n\nAfter an hour and a half of negotiations, though, the leaders emerged with an agreement: China, which has tightened its controls on rare earth minerals used to make cars, phones and fighter jets, would postpone those strict new rules for a year. Separately, Trump said he would halve the 20 percent tariffs he had imposed to pressure China to do more to fight fentanyl trafficking.\n\nThe deal wraps up Trump’s tour of Asia. Over the past six days, he has hopscotched the continent chasing trade pacts and peace agreements. “Trump came here seeking deals, plain and simple,” says Katie Rogers, a White House correspondent who is traveling with the president. He seemed to get what he wanted. As Trump boarded Air Force One to head back to Washington this morning, he waved and pumped his fist.\n\nToday’s newsletter looks at the Busan meeting and what Trump accomplished.\n\nOne of the biggest issues facing Trump and Xi was how to handle China’s extensive restrictions on exports of rare earth metals.

I’m especially eager to hear your thoughts this week because this is our last conversation before Tuesday’s elections, the results of which will be read like rune stones. We’ll see in them the fortunes of President Trump and of the Democratic Party in — and beyond — the 2026 midterms. What do you think these contests will (or won’t) reliably tell us? And while we can’t know who’ll win, which of the races do you find especially significant?\n\nBret Stephens: Hi, Frank. My concern is that a blowout victory for Zohran Mamdani in New York’s mayoral race and tight governors’s races, or even a loss, for Abigail Spanberger in Virginia or Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey will send a misleading signal that voters want more progressive Democrats, not more moderate ones. And I think that’s the worst possible lesson if Democrats want to take back Congress and win nationally.\n\nFrank: I don’t worry too much that a Mamdani victory in the city — which is its own political ecosphere and the very antonym of a national bellwether — will be seen for very long as an instruction manual for the Democratic Party writ large. Whether Mamdani is dangerous baggage for the party, in terms of being a convenient foil for President Trump, is another matter.\n\nBret: We’ll get to that in a minute. Go on …\n\nFrank: But in terms of election postmortems, it’s the New Jersey results that I think will resonate most profoundly. Jersey isn’t purple; it’s light blue. If Sherrill loses to or only squeaks past Jack Ciattarelli — a Republican who, in his third bid for the job, is aligning himself with President Trump and the MAGA movement as never before — Democrats will have great reason to sweat, but not about whether they need more progressive candidates. About the fact that after the madness and melodrama of Trump’s presidency so far, association with him isn’t toxic to swing voters, which means that campaigning against him won’t be nearly enough in 2026.\n\nBret: You’re right that it isn’t enough for Democrats to be the un- and anti-Trumps; that was probably the biggest lesson of the Kamala Harris disaster last year. Where I think you’re mistaken is that a Mamdani win, which, as I’ve written before, I think will be terrible for New York on its own terms, will also scramble Democratic brains. The argument will be that Democrats win big when they move to the left and generate fresh enthusiasm among young voters and minorities, but lose, or struggle, when they choose moderates who appeal to the center. And, as the late, great John McLaughlin might have said: WRONG! Republicans will have a field day in the midterms if they can run against the “Mamdani Democrats.”\n\nFrank: So many friendly quibbles, such limited space. For starters, Democratic brains don’t get scrambled; they get poached.\n\nBret: Or fried.\n\nFrank: Also, while I agree wholeheartedly that the Democratic path to a House majority is with — for lack of a more nuanced adjective — moderate candidates and stances, I’m not sure “Mamdani Democrats” will fly. Look at Democratic members of Congress from New York: They’re already making it clear that they are not Mamdani.\n\nBret: Er, like the House minority leader. Hakeem Jeffries, who, uh, just endorsed Mamdani? Or the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, whose last name, in Hebrew, means “Remaining Uncharacteristically Mum In Order to Protect Myself From a Primary Challenge from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”?\n\nFrank: Well, I don’t know Hebrew, but I know that Jeffries and others held out for a long while — and that tells you how they’ll be massaging their words about Mamdani going forward. In any case, there’s another way, beyond left-right, to look at whatever these elections reveal and at what they suggest about the best strategy for Democrats: Mamdani is talking (and talking) about affordability. Ditto Sherrill. Ditto Spanberger. If that prevails, maybe Democrats will get the message that while the culture wars can be exciting in their all-consuming, tediously identitarian ways, the economy — and/or perceptions about the economy — rules the day. The key to midterm success for Democrats won’t be the tags of moderate or progressive; it will be a disciplined focus on Trump’s failure to deliver on his promise to lower the cost of living.\n\nBret: The Hebrew was not exactly literal.\n\nFrank: Fear not, Bret, I never take you literally. Or too, too seriously.\n\nBret: Nor should you! The affordability issue is, of course, key. And Trump is doing Democrats a political favor with his stupid tariffs and his efforts to bully the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates, which won’t make inflation any better.\n\nFrank: While I can’t translate your Hebrew, your Trump is fluent, even eloquent.\n\nBret: As someone once said: “I know words. I have the best word. But there’s no better word than stupid.”\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats need to be wary of top-down solutions like Mamdani’s promise to freeze rent increases on rent-stabilized housing, which all-but guarantees that landlords will simply jack up rents on non-stabilized apartments in order to make up for the lost income. Ditto for Mikie Sherrill promising to freeze utility rates, which is legally questionable and does nothing to increase New Jersey’s energy supply. Haven’t these Democrats heard that what we need is more, well, abundance, not more mandates and constraints?\n\nFrank: I agree that Democrats have the emphasis right, affordability-wise, but need to do a whole lot of work on the prescriptions. Mamdani’s are fantastical, and that may well come back to bite him. He’s all smoke and social media, and while you can perhaps TikTok your way to Gracie Mansion, memes and mirth won’t plow the streets, keep subway riders safe or make the Big Apple a working-class utopia. I grant you all that. But he’s not the Democratic death knell.\n\nBret: Just New York’s. In the meantime, Frank, we’re now nearly a month into the government shutdown. So far, I don’t think the effects have been felt too widely outside of the government, but that’s about to change as tens of millions of poorer Americans lose access to federal food assistance, as Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican, wrote in a recent guest essay in The Times. How do we get ourselves out of this mess? Or put more crudely, who folds first?\n\nFrank: I hate making predictions — or, more honestly, I’m terrible at them — so instead I’ll note that the same aching-for-the-little-guy Hawley, he of the raised Jan. 6 fist, wrote a previous guest essay saying “no Medicaid cuts!” before, um, voting for Medicaid cuts. So I doubt many voters find him persuasive. But your larger point, Bret, is correct: We will soon be into the unignorable-hurt phase of this shameful shutdown. And that will scramble or poach or hard boil the political equation.\n\nBret: OK, but hard-boiled into what? Historically, the party that forces a government shutdown winds up being the biggest loser, politically. The person to listen to on this subject is Jared Golden, the Maine moderate, who makes the point that his fellow Democrats have closed the government — and all the pain that entails for the poor — in order to extend health care subsidies that were supposed to sunset this year for people making $300,000 a year. It reinforces the point that Democrats have become what Republicans once were: the party of the moneyed class.\n\nFrank: Um, “people making $300,000 a year” is not the whole of the affected population. Far from it. But I take Golden’s questions about the wisdom of the shutdown seriously. That said, you can’t bring up Maine — or, as I often think of it, America’s Strategic Lobster Roll Reserve — and not have me ask you for your reflections on a certain oyster farmer by the name of Graham Platner and Democrats’ reactions to his … body art and all that it signifies.\n\nBret: Hey, we all make mistakes. What’s a little Nazi tattoo between friends? I myself used to have a Confederate flag tattooed on my neck. But I had it covered up with a tasteful Edelweiss flower.\n\nFrank: You’re a paragon of personal growth — and epidermal horticulture.\n\nBret: Seriously, though, I don’t understand how Platner’s tattoo isn’t instantly disqualifying. I’ve spent the last decade listening to my liberal friends lament how Republicans have failed to police their own when it came to the normalization of political hate and extremism. But here are people like Bernie Sanders doing exactly that when it comes to a so-called progressive. The Maine Senate race is more than a year away. Plenty of time for Democrats to get a better candidate.\n\nFrank: Agreed. In fact they have one, Janet Mills. And on that happy note (for those of us wishing for a Democratic Senate majority), what, Bret, have you read, watched or listened to lately that lifted you up?\n\nBret: Frank, sometimes a news story in The Times is so good I actually read it aloud to friends and family. That was the case with Neil Vigdor’s wonderful Oct. 25 report on the midday heist at the Louvre museum in Paris, in which he interviewed two former jewel thieves, Larry Lawton and Joan Hannington, to get their expert opinion on how that job went down. We’ll soon know more because at least two suspects have reportedly been apprehended, but you have to love how Vigdor relays George Clooney’s, aka Danny Ocean of “Ocean’s 11” fame, insight: “‘It was cool, though,” Clooney said. “I mean, it’s terrible. But if you’re a professional thief like I am, I was very proud of those guys.’” Gold.\n\nFrank: I loved the last sentences of a terrific essay in The Times by Jesse Green about the new movie “Blue Moon,” which stars Ethan Hawke as the renowned lyricist Lorenz Hart, who wrote all those classic songs with Richard Rodgers. Green noted that too often, Hollywood portrays great American songwriters as “lucky burghers sailing on happy clouds of easy inspiration and ambient romance,” but that “Blue Moon” shows the “endless brain work and bullheadedness of craft, fighting to stay afloat on a sea of mediocrity.” In an age of artifice and disintegrating standards, a plug for that — a plea for that — seems apt.\n\nBret: Nothing harder than making it look easy.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

His headline lives on.\n\nFifty years after my father, William J. Brink, wrote the words “Ford to City: Drop Dead” on a piece of copy paper at The New York Daily News, the headline endures in the national consciousness. It has become a universal front-page stand-in for No Way, No Chance, Go Take a Hike or, in New York City parlance, Fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nAnd headline writers can’t seem to forget about it. Publications as disparate as The Char-Koosta News in Montana (the official publication of the Flathead Indian Reservation) and a baseball newsletter (“Reds to Metsies: Drop Dead”) have used it this year. The New York Post apparently keeps the headline on a shelf and dusts it off every now and then, as it did in March with “Albany to Crime Victims: Drop Dead.” Friends have told me they’ve seen a version staring up at them from newsstands in small Midwestern cities.\n\nThe headline has thrived in the Trump era. CNN Business invoked it earlier this month to describe National Guard troops in Portland, Ore., and Chicago (“Trump to Cities: Drop Dead”). The New York Times’s Opinion section copied it in 2020 for a column about the pandemic: “Trump to New York: Drop Dead.” In September, Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, vowed that the Trump administration would never bail out New York City in any future fiscal crisis, declaring: “It will be the same thing that Gerald Ford said: ‘Drop dead.’”\n\nFord, then the president, never actually uttered those fateful words. My father did, on the night of Oct. 29, 1975, as he stood with Daily News editors barking out various options as deadline approached. No matter. The words played an outsize role in history. Ford himself acknowledged that the headline, driving home his denial of federal aid to help New York avoid bankruptcy, contributed to his loss in the 1976 presidential election against Jimmy Carter.\n\n“Drop Dead” is generally considered one of the two most memorable headlines of the last half-century, along with The New York Post’s 1983 gem, “Headless Body in Topless Bar.” But why is it so enduring? I wouldn’t want to overinterpret its social or cultural significance. After all, the beauty of the headline was in its simplicity. As Margalit Fox wrote for The New York Times in my father’s obituary, the headline delivered “the power of a knockout punch.” When we get hit hard in the face, we tend to remember it.\n\nBut the headline also had the benefit of truth-telling, at a time when truth was easier to discern and less open to argument. There were only three major television networks, with anchors who enjoyed respect and credibility. Time and Newsweek still mattered. The Daily News itself still carried heft as the paper of New York’s working class, with a weekday circulation of around two million.\n\nMore significantly, media consumers didn’t face a fire hose of conflicting or false messages that distorted their understanding of events. Today, we don’t even agree on facts. Back then, we could rally as a country around messages so direct and attention-getting that they stood as anthems for a moment in time: “Men Walk on Moon,” “Jets Win Super Bowl” (now you know we’re talking about a long time ago), “Nixon Resigns.”\n\n“Drop Dead.”\n\n(A tip to headline writers: Avoid commas, semicolons and the word “castigate,” if you want to have impact. The Times’s corresponding headline that day — “Ford, Castigating City, Asserts He’d Veto Federal Bailout; Offers Bankruptcy Bill” — stands as a verbose counterpoint to “Drop Dead.”)\n\nI was young at the time, and its impact barely registered on me. But the headline never really disappeared from any discussion of my father’s career: “Drop Dead” was constantly resurrected by family, friends or people who randomly discovered he had written it.\n\nThis is curious for anyone who knew him and the story of his life, which spanned the arc of the 20th century. Born during World War I and raised during the Great Depression, he served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and as a journalist for United Press International and then Newsweek. He covered the Nixon-Kennedy election, the Kennedy assassination and the civil rights movement, on which he co-wrote two books. His last stop: managing editor of The News.\n\nI was certainly familiar with my father’s no-nonsense approach. Two of his favorite expressions when he was fed up were “for crying out loud” and “knock it off,” which I knew meant it was time to drop the shenanigans and do the right thing. Implicit in “Drop Dead” was not only that Ford had rebuffed New York, but that he had made a big mistake in doing so.\n\nThe headline also hinted at an arched eye, and a certain playfulness, that my father brought to his job. During New York’s dire fiscal times, he came up with a scheme to chronicle the horrible potholes that were wreaking havoc on the city’s cars and trucks: He ordered up a jerry-built vehicle that he called the “Joltmobile,” which rumbled across the boroughs bumping over potholes and registering their impact with a makeshift meter on the back.\n\nFor Nixon’s famous visit to China, he decided to have a calligrapher draw Chinese characters for a front-page message to Nixon. But as deadline approached, my father panicked over the accuracy of the characters. He went around to Chinese restaurants to show the page to workers, and he wasn’t satisfied until three of them verified that the message was correct.\n\nHe was self-effacing, but I would try to get him talking about his life and career as we ate breakfast on the back porch of my parents’ home in Connecticut, or watched the Yankees on a summer evening. He chuckled as he told me how he had been fired from his first job at The Indianapolis Star for “writing bad headlines.” It was really for union activities, he said, but they needed an excuse to let him go. For all his professional attributes, none were greater than the example he set as a husband for more than 50 years to my mother, as a father to four sons and as an inspiration for my career in journalism.\n\nAll this, so much of what made him the person he was, seems to recede in favor of the famous headline that is still going strong 50 years later. When my father died in July 2005, I delivered a eulogy that recalled him as a master of small acts that added up to a lot. The irony is that he is remembered for one big one.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/arts/design/studio-museum-harlem-adjaye.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:03:32-04:00","title":"Harlem’s Remarkable New Studio Museum Redefines 125th Street","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Studio Museum in Harlem, founded in 1968 and now expanded into a $160 million, seven-story building, represents a pivotal moment in the neighborhood’s cultural and architectural evolution.

Street. Charcoal and gray, its jumbled facade of sculptured, stacked niches and window frames is poised like a Mondrian.\n\nIt faces off the towering, broad-shouldered Adam Clayton Powell Jr., State Office Building across the street, holding its own. Those grays and blacks, matte and polished, shift in the changing light.\n\nThe building is an architectural essay on varieties of blackness in precast concrete and polished aggregate.\n\nFounded by a group of artists and philanthropists, the Studio Museum opened in 1968 in a loft over a liquor store. It moved during the early ’80s into a former bank it had been gifted that still had Depression-era wiring and no air conditioning.\n\nJ. Max Bond Jr., the esteemed Black architect and Harlem resident, performed miracles on a shoestring, retrofitting the bank’s interior. The museum put on groundbreaking shows. But like so many Black institutions in Harlem, it had no choice except to make do with its improvisatory architecture.\n\nThe new $160 million building is a different animal. It rises seven stories where the bank was demolished, doubling Studio’s exhibition space.\n\nThe museum now has custom-built classrooms for school groups; studios for resident artists; a library; a soaring, eye-popping lobby and monumental staircase that is the building’s circulatory and social spine; and also rooms where community organizations can meet.\n\nFrom the roof garden, designed by Studio Zewde, a Harlem firm, the South Bronx is visible to the north past the famous YMCA tower on 135th Street. To the south, Midtown’s skinny supertalls preen over Harlem’s brownstones. Up there, the museum can feel like the center of the city.\n\nConstruction was delayed by the pandemic. The project took seven years. A scandal involving its brand-name lead architect, David Adjaye, caused him to absent himself, leaving the museum and the rest of its design team scrambling.\n\nFor its price tag and architectural ambition, it was an undertaking that only much wealthier institutions typically attempt. The Studio Museum had $10 million in reserves when the project started. Its endowment was zero.\n\nA capital campaign by its director, Thelma Golden, an art world force-of-nature and famous figure in Harlem, raised $307 million, unheard-of for a small cultural organization. The extra money kept the Studio Museum’s operations and exhibition program afloat during those seven years, and also established a $23 million cash reserve and a $52 million endowment to insure that the lights stay on moving forward.\n\nNow the building is finally opening Nov. 15. It’s a remarkable accomplishment and an uplifting, uncompromising addition to the city’s civic landscape.\n\nIt arrives on a 125th Street much changed from when the museum first moved there, with yet more churn on the way. The National Black Theater is moving into a new mixed-use, mixed-income tower it codeveloped on its former site. The Apollo Theater is undergoing a major renovation. It recently took over the Victoria Theater, next door, where a luxury hotel and affordable housing complex have risen.\n\nAnd across the street from the Studio Museum, the Urban League Empowerment Center is a new office building with subsidized housing in the rear, a civil rights museum and a Trader Joe’s and Target on the street.\n\nAll that was unimaginable during the 1960s, when Harlem was hemorrhaging population and in free fall. Officials in Albany, promising Harlemites jobs, decided to demolish the whole north side of 125th Street between Seventh and Lenox Avenues, opposite where the Studio Museum is now, to make way for the state office building.\n\nProtesters occupied the demolition site, demanding that Black residents, not upstate politicians and outsiders, determine what gets built on 125th Street. They erected a tent village with a field kitchen, health clinic and day care center, an early version of the pop-up encampments of the 2011 Occupy movement. The protesters renamed the demolition zone Reclamation Site No. 1.\n\nPolice forced the protesters to leave after several weeks. The 19-story state office building opened in 1974 on the corner where Malcolm X had delivered speeches outside Lewis Michaux’s National Memorial African Book Store.\n\nBut the eviction of the protesters wasn’t the end of the story. A coalition of local church leaders, bank presidents and other moderate community members in Harlem picked up where Reclamation Site No. 1 left off. They believed Black self-determination depended on financial autonomy. Future development on 125th Street would need to include office buildings, along with hotels, cultural tent poles and retail, to funnel wealth and other benefits to Black residents.\n\n“Gentrification was never simply a process that happened to residents of Harlem,” as Brian Goldstein, an architectural historian of Harlem’s late-20th-century development, points out. “For decades gentrification has been a project of insiders.”\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s it was led by the Abyssinian Baptist Development Corporation, the economic arm of the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III’s Abyssinian Baptist Church. The corporation built affordable and senior housing, schools, and developed the undistinguished but pivotal office tower by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer that now houses a CVS and a Marshalls, on the lot where the tent village had stood.\n\nWhat have these changes brought?\n\nIt’s complicated. There’s now a Wells Fargo where Lenox Lounge used to be. Harlemites can now shop at Trader Joe’s and at a Whole Foods up the block from the Studio Museum. Median rents in Central Harlem increased by 23 percent from 2006 to 2023, according to the N.Y.U. Furman Center. Gentrification has stirred a mix of opportunity and fear.\n\nDarren Walker was chief operating officer for Abyssinian Development Corporation during the 1990s and early 2000s. Until recently he led the Ford Foundation, which last year awarded $10 million to endow Golden’s director’s position at the Studio Museum.\n\nIts new building, he agrees, is part of a long transformation along 125th Street “rooted in Black culture and identity. Black cultural institutions were always told to make something out of nothing,” he says. “Ambitions were miniaturized. Make do was a metaphor for unworthiness.”\n\n\"The Studio Museum should now put a nail in that coffin.”\n\nAdjaye Associates and Cooper Robertson, working with the structural engineer Guy Nordenson, are credited as architects for the project. Adjaye was the lead architect until an article in The Financial Times in 2023 reported on accusations by three unnamed women in his office of sexual harassment, assault and a “toxic work culture.”\n\nHe has denied the allegations. But clients cut ties and he retreated from projects that were far along, including the Studio Museum. He and Golden had worked closely on it for years.\n\nAmong those who stepped up are Pascale Sablan, from Adjaye Associates, and Erin Flynn at Cooper Robertson. Flynn served as executive architect at the Princeton Art Museum, as well, another stunning new Adjaye design, opening this weekend.\n\nUltimately, the building belongs to Harlem. The lobby becomes a de facto new indoor town square. All gray concrete, it can seem austere at a glance. I suspect it will quickly morph into a gathering spot once it’s packed with people and art.\n\nIt meets the sidewalk on 125th Street through glass doors, beckoning crowds to come in, climb the showpiece staircase and lounge on the bleacher seating that spills down like an indoor stoop to a cafe.\n\nAs with other Adjaye projects, the palette is restrained, the symbolism layered, the aesthetic severe, brawny, unapologetic. Marcel Breuer’s former Whitney Museum on Madison Avenue may come to mind. It’s where Golden cut her curatorial teeth. There, as here, material refinement and an undercurrent of warmth suffuse the Brutalist concrete.\n\nIn 1968, the Studio Museum opened with a show devoted to Tom Lloyd, then a little-known sculptor from Queens. Lloyd devised joyful, jury-rigged, blinking light sculptures using multicolored, rewired car amps. Abstraction was widely seen back then as white art. For Lloyd, Black art was whatever Black artists decided it would be. This would become the mantra of the museum.\n\nIts new building opens, fittingly, with a Lloyd retrospective. It fills a double-height, barrel-vaulted room set apart from the museum’s more flexible, white box galleries. The barrel vault nods to Harlem’s religious sanctuaries, pillars of civic life and sources of inspiration in the neighborhood.\n\nWe’ll see what the room inspires in artists who will be invited to do special projects in the coming years.\n\nI heard from Harlemites during the museum’s years of construction that Golden and her colleagues repeatedly went out of their way to keep neighbors abreast of progress, and sent out alerts whenever heavy equipment would close streets or sidewalks. “More often than not, organizations show up once at the community board,” one Harlemite told me.\n\nIt was a small point, but I passed the remarks on to Golden. She looked surprised.\n\n“Why wouldn’t we tell people what’s happening?” she asked. “These are our neighbors.”\n\n“I live here,” she said. “We live here.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/republicans-hispanics-new-jersey.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:03:05-04:00","title":"What New Jersey Could Reveal About the Future of the Hispanic Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New Jersey’s 2025 governor’s race is emerging as a critical barometer for the future of the Hispanic vote in American politics.

About the Future of the Hispanic Vote\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T05:03:05-04:00\n\nMoments after Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, bounded down the steps of his campaign bus on the first day of early voting, he began to rattle off statistics about the size and strength of the state’s Latino population.\n\n“We have more than two million people that are of Hispanic descent and more than 500,000 that are Puerto Rican,” Mr. Ciattarelli said, flanked by the Republican governor of Puerto Rico who had flown in to campaign with him. “And we’re so very happy that they called New Jersey home.”\n\nLatino voters are not only a critical swing bloc in this year’s New Jersey governor’s race but also an important test nationally of just how enduring the gains that President Trump made last year in the Hispanic community will prove.\n\nMr. Trump lost New Jersey by less than six percentage points in 2024, a surprisingly close result that came largely because of his remarkable strength in the state’s most diverse areas. Every single one of New Jersey’s 29 townships with a majority Hispanic population swung in Mr. Trump’s direction between 2020 and 2024 — by an average of 25 percentage points.\n\nA handful of once reliably Democratic areas flipped to the G.O.P., including Clifton, a township that is roughly 40 percent Hispanic and where Mr. Ciattarelli’s bus stopped on Saturday.\n\nChange in presidential margin from 2020 to 2024\n\nTrump’s biggest\n\ngains were in\n\nmajority-Hispanic towns in the northeast.\n\nMajority-nonwhite\n\nAtlantic City\n\nTrump’s biggest gains were in\n\nmajority-Hispanic towns in the\n\nMajority-nonwhite townships\n\nAtlantic City\n\nNote: Includes townships where more than 500 votes were cast in 2024.\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nNow the question looming over 2025 is whether the historic movement to the right among Hispanics was evidence of a durable political and racial realignment or a passing phenomenon specific to Mr. Trump — and whether any other Republican besides Mr. Trump can lure Latino voters into the Republican fold.\n\n“New Jersey ends up being the first meaningful temperature check since the last election,” said Carlos Odio, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying Latino voting patterns and lives in New Jersey.\n\nMr. Odio said the answer would be especially significant because Latino voters will hold significant sway in determining control of the House of Representatives in 2026. His firm’s data shows the Hispanic share of the population in the 40 most competitive House seats is 18 percent — compared with 13 percent nationwide. And 12 of the most competitive seats have at least a 20 percent Latino population, though the figure would shift somewhat if California voters approve remapping the state.\n\nIn New Jersey, the fact that both Mr. Ciattarelli and Representative Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee, have invested significantly in outreach to Latino voters has only heightened the significance of the outcome.\n\nMs. Sherrill and her super PAC allies have spent roughly $4 million on Spanish-language advertising and campaigned aggressively in Hispanic communities. Mr. Ciattarelli participated in a recent Spanish-language town hall sponsored by Univision and was recently endorsed by a coalition of more than 100 Latino pastors and ministers. He has made it a mission to march in practically every Hispanic cultural parade in the state.\n\nOne of Mr. Ciattarelli’s challenges will be trying to match Mr. Trump’s 2024 gains in diverse corners of the state without ceding his own past relative strength in 2021 in whiter and more educated towns.\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nIt is unclear whether voters in majority-Hispanic areas will show the same enthusiasm for Mr. Ciattarelli as they did for Mr. Trump in 2024.\n\nThe density of Latino voters in some New Jersey municipalities makes it a uniquely appealing place for political strategists to measure movement in the community. For instance, Union City, just across the Hudson River from New York, is more than 80 percent Hispanic; the township swung 27 percentage points toward the Republican Party in the last presidential election.\n\n“The results will be considered a bellwether,” said Katharine Pichardo, the president of Latino Victory Fund, which seeks to elect Latino Democrats. “What Democrats hope to see is significant erosion of the gains that Trump was able to make with Latinos last year.”\n\nStill, Republicans are bullish that Mr. Ciattarelli can hold onto Mr. Trump’s gains.\n\n“The Latinos are the second wave, like the Irish and Italians who came over in the 1930s: blue-collar American working people to make a better life for themselves,” said Peter Murphy, who owns an Irish bar and is the chairman of the Passaic County Republican Party, which flipped for Mr. Trump in 2024. “Now the Irish and the Italians are a major backbone of the Republican Party. I believe the Latinos now are the backbone of the Republican Party also.”\n\nPassaic County, which is New Jersey’s most Hispanic, is one of more than 1,400 counties nationwide that trended toward the Republican Party not just in 2024 but in three consecutive elections since 2016. Last year, Mr. Trump carried the congressional district that Representative Nellie Pou, a Democrat, won, making her one of 13 House Democrats to survive in a Trump-won district and a potential Republican target next year.\n\nMr. Trump improved Republican performance not just in Latino areas but also in heavily Black and Asian areas. Across all of the state’s majority-nonwhite townships, Mr. Trump cut his margin of defeat to 27 points from 43 points in 2020, amounting to a 16-point rightward shift.\n\nIn other words, Democrats were still winning those areas but by far less.\n\nStill, there are already some signs of softening support for Mr. Trump among Hispanic voters. An October Associated Press-NORC poll showed that the share of Hispanic adults who have a favorable view of Mr. Trump has dropped since he took office in January.\n\n“His gains are not permanent,” Patricia Campos-Medina, a leading Latino activist in the state and the vice chair of the Sherrill campaign. “Can we fix the backsliding of the last 10 years, just in these six months in these three months of spending? I do not think so. But we’re going to move back the needle toward a better outcome for Democrats with Latino voters.”\n\nFor now, Ms. Sherrill, who holds a narrow lead in the polls, currently has an edge of 30 points among nonwhite voters, according to polling from the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nOne of the central questions for strategists of both parties is what issues would drive any potential drift back toward the Democratic Party.\n\nHispanic Americans consistently show among the highest levels of economic stress. In the same A.P. survey, 65 percent of Hispanic adults said the cost of groceries was a strain, compared with 54 percent of U.S. adults overall.\n\nMs. Campos-Medina said Mr. Trump’s failure to address the cost of living had made him vulnerable — more so than his administration’s attention-grabbing immigration enforcement.\n\n“They are not concerned on immigration raids,” she said of Hispanic voters. “They care about it because they see them. But that’s not what drives them to the polls. What drives them to the polls is: Do I have affordable housing? Do my schools — are they teaching my kids what they need to learn? Do I have access to health care? Where am I going to get my new job?”\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Ciattarelli had held Mr. Trump at arm’s length — and outperformed him among whiter and wealthier areas that have trended more Democratic in recent years.\n\nThis year, Mr. Ciattarelli has secured the president’s endorsement and avoided virtually any criticism, giving the president an ‘A’ grade when asked, adding that the president “has been right about everything that he’s doing.”\n\nThe election will test whether Mr. Ciattarelli’s balancing act allows him to mimic Mr. Trump’s strengths in diverse areas without losing ground in more white communities.\n\nCiattarelli did better than Trump in whiter, more college-educated areas\n\nTrump did better than Ciattarelli in more diverse metro areas\n\nAtlantic City\n\nCiattarelli did better\n\nthan Trump in whiter, more college-educated areas\n\nTrump did better than Ciattarelli in more diverse metro areas\n\nAtlantic City\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nTurnout is another X-factor.\n\nTurnout typically drops off substantially in the governor’s race compared with the presidential election the year before, and the drop-off is often steepest in diverse urban areas.\n\nThat is one reason the 2021 governor’s race was so much closer than the 2020 presidential election. Even as Mr. Murphy won majority-Hispanic communities by 48 points, a similar margin to that of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in New Jersey in 2020, those areas saw much bigger drops in turnout than the rest of the state.\n\nIn other words, Ms. Sherrill doesn’t just want to win a greater share of Hispanic voters but also to coax the community to the polls in greater numbers.\n\nEach circle is a township in New Jersey, sized by the number of votes cast in 2021\n\nNote: Includes townships where more than 500 votes were cast in 2021.\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nIn Union City, Mr. Trump in 2024 won more than four times as many votes as Mr. Ciattarelli did in 2021, even as former Vice President Kamala Harris had won virtually the same number of votes as Mr. Murphy did in 2021.\n\n“This is going to give us a great indicator of how 2026 can go,” said Laura Matos, a Democratic strategist working with a pro-Sherrill super PAC and a Democratic National Committee member in New Jersey, “It will be a road map of the work we need to continue to do.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/style/israel-gaza-war-jewish-left-zionism.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:49-04:00","title":"What the Jewish Left Is Building for Itself","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores a growing movement among young American Jews who are rejecting traditional Zionist narratives and building new, alternative Jewish communities that emphasize anti-Zionism, Palestinian rights, and global solidarity.

What the Jewish Left Is Building for Itself\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T05:00:49-04:00\n\nFor Leah Robbins, growing up in rural Florida meant that Saturday morning synagogue services were followed by lunch at Bono’s Pit Bar-B-Q.\n\nMs. Robbins lived mostly around non-Jews, so her family members were proud and precise about the way they expressed their Jewish identity. To her parents, part of being Jewish meant donating to the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC, and encouraging Ms. Robbins when she chose to sing the Israeli national anthem while her classmates recited the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nBut during college and in the years after, as Ms. Robbins met friends who challenged her understanding of Israel’s history, its treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and its conduct in wars in Gaza, her beliefs about Israel shifted far from those of her Zionist upbringing. She now argues that young Jews who are critical of Israel, like herself, need to build new communities — new spiritual congregations, new schools — that don’t emphasize Zionism.\n\nWatching with flooding relief and trepidation the news of an Israel-Hamas cease-fire, as well as the hostage and prisoner releases, she has asked herself, “When we’re on the other side of this devastation, what’s going to be left of Judaism if the Jewish left isn’t building it right now?”\n\nFor years, there had been a sticky and prevailing narrative about the role left-wing Jews played in the broader Jewish community, according to some Jewish leaders and rabbis. The story went like this: young progressive Jews might push their communities to be more critical of Israel, but as they became older they would send their children to the same Jewish day schools they had attended, where those children would sing pioneer songs and eat falafel on Israeli independence day.\n\nIn other words, young Jews who criticized Israel would simply come to accept the organizations and institutions they grew up in — or, maybe, leave them.\n\nBut that is not what is happening today, at least in some Jewish families.\n\nAcross scattered corners of the United States are glimpses of how much progressive Jewish communities have grown or gained wider recognition over the last two years, especially those that don’t identify as Zionist.\n\nMs. Robbins is raising money with the goal of starting a “diasporist” Jewish day school in Boston, one that puts its emphasis on Judaism outside Israel and teaches Israel’s history with a non-Zionist approach. Three Jewish friends who met in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and now live in Brooklyn, recently went door knocking for a Muslim mayoral candidate who pledged to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he steps foot in New York.\n\nA rabbi in Chicago gathered 400 families for high holiday services in a congregation that is pro-Palestinian and won’t raise the Israeli flag. Most of these groups acknowledge the horror of the attacks by Hamas militants on Oct 7. 2023; they also condemn the Israeli government’s response and the war in Gaza, as well as Israel’s occupation of the West Bank that long predated the war.\n\nIn nearly two dozen interviews in recent weeks, it is clear that young people — some proudly Zionist, some pro-Israel but critical of its government, some anti-Zionist, some uncertain — are wrestling with thorny questions:  What will American Jewish communities look like in the future, and how will they think about Israel?\n\nInstitutional leaders recognize the uncertainty swirling around this. “Your responsibility as a Jewish leader is to be concerned about the people within your movement,” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, who leads the largest movement of American Jewry, the Reform movement. “We’re at a critical moment. I don’t think at this moment we have a clear sense of where it’s going.”\n\nThis critical moment, since Oct. 7, 2023, has been a painful one for so many, prompting questions within families and communities about morality, safety and identity.  What was already a stark generational divide on Israel in the American Jewish community has deepened. Pew polling released in 2024 found that younger Jews expressed more negative feelings toward Israel than older Jews did. A Washington Post poll last month found that 56 percent of Jewish Americans felt an emotional attachment to Israel, but that figure fell to 36 percent among those ages 18 to 34.\n\nThe number of dues-paying members in IfNotNow, an American Jewish group that opposes Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, has grown more than 500 percent since Oct. 7, 2023, reaching over 6,000 people.  Rabbis for Ceasefire, which formed after Oct. 7, now has some 430 rabbis. Jewish Voice for Peace said it increased its annual budget from $5 million to $9 million and its chapters from 45 to more than 100 in the past two years.\n\nIn absolute numbers, these communities are small, though fast expanding. Arielle Angel, the editor in chief of the left-wing magazine Jewish Currents, called for more of these groups in a recent editorial. “We need new Jewish institutions,” she wrote.\n\nThe views of these left-wing Jews could keep shifting, Mr. Jacobs said. “If this war is in fact ending, what is the possibility that there could be in the coming months a new government in Israel, a reconnecting of young Jews who had been confused or pained by the war?” he added.\n\nA majority of Jews remain emotionally and politically attached to Israel and to supporting its continued existence as a Jewish state. American Jews also support “Israel’s actions in Gaza” in greater shares than overall Americans do, according to Washington Post and Gallup polling.\n\nBut in interviews, some younger Jews say they’ve become increasingly unwilling to join or attend synagogues, schools, camps and nonprofits that don’t share their views on the recent war in Gaza.\n\n“Four in 10 American Jews believe Israel has committed a genocide,” said Daniel May, the publisher of Jewish Currents, citing Washington Post polling. “There’s a disconnect between that number, and the view of American Jewish institutions, where even the most liberal places have leaders that have refrained from calling this a genocide. People who feel committed to Jewish life have no choice but to create new Jewish communities.”\n\nThat is what Ms. Robbins is doing in trying to start a Jewish day school that doesn’t put Zionism at the core of its Jewish belief system. The school will be called Achvat Olam, meaning universal solidarity, and she plans for it to open in the fall of 2029.  “There is a real hunger to save the soul of Judaism,” she said, “and see it decoupled from nationalism.”\n\nIn September, Jews for Racial & Economic Justice, a progressive New York-based organizing group, filled a Sunset Park sports center for its gala, the Mazals, with some 1,000 attendees. Dressed in a high-low mix of sequins and clogs, attendees bumped into childhood friends from summer camp, while a speaker shouted, “Mazel tov and free Palestine!”\n\nMilling around the crowd were three women who had all, at one point, felt strongly enough about their connection to Israel, and responsibility for its actions, that they went to live there. They became friends while living in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Now, none of them identify as Zionists.\n\nOne of them is Simone Zimmerman, 34, a longtime left-wing Jewish activist, who is the co-founder of IfNotNow and focus of the 2023 film “Israelism.” That documentary tells the story of how Ms. Zimmerman came to question her support for Israel, starting when she was a student at Berkeley.\n\nHer friend Liya Rechtman, 33, grew up in Brooklyn and spent her teenage years signing up for every pro-Israel activity she could find. She did a weeklong training program affiliated with the Israel Defense Forces and recruited college classmates to Birthright Israel, which provides young Jews with all-expenses paid trips there. Ms. Rechtman said she grew more critical of Israel while living there in 2016 and 2017, especially seeing the violent attacks that Palestinians in the West Bank faced from settlers.\n\nShe visited Germany shortly after Oct. 7, participating in a Jewish leadership program, and told the room she felt ashamed to be Jewish because of Israel’s actions in Gaza.\n\nThere was an audible gasp. “It was upsetting for some people to hear that,” Ms. Rechtman recalled.\n\nNatasha Westheimer, 35, was the last of the trio to leave Israel, remaining until well after the start of the war. Ms. Westheimer said she broke her hand when Israeli soldiers cracked down on an anti-occupation demonstration in the West Bank in 2021. Over time, she grew more concerned about going to these demonstrations, as the risks rose and advocacy opportunities shrank— but she also didn’t feel comfortable living there without joining activism and civil disobedience led by her Palestinian neighbors. She moved back to the United States in 2024.\n\nMs. Westheimer was struck by just how many anti-occupation activists she met in Israel had since become anti-Zionist activists living in New York.\n\nMs. Rechtman echoed this. “There is a broad network of people,” she said, “that I see myself as part of, who have intimacy with Israeli culture and who have my left-wing politics and my understanding of the stakes.”\n\nThe author Benjamin Moser has been at the New York Public Library, in recent months, writing a book about anti-Zionist Jews. His research traces the opposition these rabbis, lawyers, poets and scholars have faced, from Britain to Brazil and Amsterdam to Houston.\n\n“My book tells a pretty unbroken story from the 19th century to the present,” said Mr. Moser, “Of anti-Zionist Jews being exiled and killed, being fired from their jobs, families splitting up.”\n\nParts of that are what Jewish groups on the left are still experiencing, even as their numbers grow. Lex Rofeberg, 34, a non-Zionist rabbi who lives in Providence, R.I., was targeted by Canary Mission, a group that says it exposes critics of Israel, for his political views. When he was invited to speak at a Reform synagogue in Milwaukee, his hometown, his mother, Ruth Lebed, was surprised to hear “through the grapevine” that some locals were uncomfortable with Mr. Rofeberg’s visit.\n\nWhen she posted in a Facebook group about his involvement with the film “Israelism,” which explores anti-Zionism, online acquaintances blocked her.\n\n“There are people out there who think that his views on Israel make him antisemitic,” said Ms. Lebed, 67. “Which is ridiculous. The guy is a rabbi.”\n\nAn anti-Zionist rabbi in the Chicago area, Brant Rosen, 62, said he was thrown out of his local rabbinical network because of his beliefs. He left the congregation in Evanston, where he had worked for 16 years, because of tensions within the community about his activism. Mr. Rosen decided to start his own anti-Zionist congregation, called Tzedek Chicago (Tzedek means justice in Hebrew), which has more than doubled in size since the Israel-Hamas War began, growing to more than 400 dues-paying households.\n\nMr. Rosen has felt, since the start of the recent war, that Jews who support and oppose Israel’s policies cannot be together in communities..  “I think the middle ground has become untenable,” he said.\n\nStill, there are many organizations on the Jewish left that identify as Zionist and want to make space for people who are profoundly, wholeheartedly critical of Israel.\n\n“You have a lot of young people saying, ‘This is important to me, but it’s not, as I’ve been told, a simple yes or no, do I support Israel or not?’” said Hadar Susskind, chief executive of New Jewish Narrative, a progressive Zionist group.\n\nYoung people he talks to say they care about Israel but are also deeply opposed to the current government.\n\n“So many people, were taught that it’s ‘You support Israel, period,’” he continued. “Many people are not willing to have that be the end of the discussion.”\n\nVivian Russell, 17, was walking in Park Slope in September when she bumped into Ms. Rechtman, Ms. Zimmerman and Ms. Westheimer canvassing with Jews for Racial & Economic Justice. She stopped to introduce herself.\n\nMs. Russell, a high school student who lives in Washington Heights, told them that she found herself at odds with her public school classmates during conversations about the Israel-Hamas War. She didn’t agree with the Jewish Student Union at her school, so she joined the Muslim Student Union instead.\n\nBack uptown in Washington Heights, two days before the recent Oct. 7 anniversary, Ms. Russell sat with her mother, Dara Herman. Ms. Russell calls herself an anti-Zionist. Ms. Herman, 52, is “more sympathetic to Israel’s plight.”\n\nTheir exchanges echo those of so many Jewish families, whose group chats and Sabbath tables have become more tense since 2023.\n\n“If I have kids, I’ll be raising my kids Jewish and celebrating Jewish holidays and stuff,” said Ms. Russell, as she sat with her mother at a neighborhood coffee shop. “But I don’t think that I’ll tell them, ‘Oh Israel is the place of our people.’”\n\nHer mother replied: “But how do you square that with the ancient history that I’ve been taught — that Jews were from Israel, that all those years we wandered in the desert and then finally came back to Israel. Is all of that false?”\n\n“That was many, many years ago!” her daughter said.\n\n“I’m only one generation from the Holocaust,” Ms. Herman said. “It feels very real to me that less than 100 years ago there were millions of Jews being killed and those who survived needed somewhere to go.”\n\nBut Ms. Herman, watching her daughter’s evolution, realizes that the Jewish community is transforming as it absorbs a new generation.\n\nIt also seems possible, some activists say, that those groups will recede and the new groups that a younger generation on the left is building — like the school Ms. Robbins hopes to start or Mr. Rosen’s congregation — will become some form of establishment.\n\nMs. Russell, whose father is Irish American, declared that she felt confident in the set of ideas about Judaism she wanted to pass on to her future children.\n\n“I’ll teach them about how my people — both Jews and Irish people — have been rebels,” Ms. Russell said. “Both are a group of people that have struggled, and cared about each other, and cared about freedom.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/climate/electricity-prices.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:05-04:00","title":"Why the Price of Electricity Is Spiking Around the Country","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Electricity prices across the United States are rising, but the impact varies significantly by region.

Country\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T05:00:05-04:00\n\nSupported by\n\nNot all states have gotten hit equally hard. The reasons are complex.\n\nBy Brad PlumerHarry Stevens and Rebecca F. Elliott\n\nMillions of Americans have watched with dismay as their electricity bills have spiraled upward over the past few years. The rising price of power is squeezing households and businesses, and voter fury over higher costs is jolting elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia.\n\nPresident Trump, who as a candidate promised to cut electric bills in half within 18 months, has blamed wind and solar power for soaring costs. Democrats say the problem is Mr. Trump’s throttling of renewable energy, while others point to the rapid spread of energy-hungry data centers.\n\nBut the factors driving electricity rates are often more complicated and depend on where you live, according to a comprehensive new study by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nNot all states are suffering equally. Over the past six years, the average retail price of electricity has risen faster than inflation in 26 states. But rates have stayed flat or even declined in the rest of the country in real terms (that is, they’ve grown more slowly than overall inflation).\n\nNote: Prices are for residential electricity, inflation-adjusted to August 2025. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nMany states that have seen a major expansion of wind and solar power, like Nevada or North Dakota, have seen prices stay flat or decline, although there are some important exceptions to this rule. California is a leader in renewable energy but has seen some of the largest electricity rate increases in the country, in part because devastating wildfires have imposed steep costs on utilities, which often get passed onto households. In the Northeast, states have struggled with high natural gas prices.\n\n“There are so many different factors that can drive up electricity prices, depending on where you live,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the Brattle Group, a research firm based in Boston that contributed to the study. “It’s a more nuanced story than what you often see in the headlines.”\n\nThe simplest factor behind surging power prices is inflation. Since 2021, as a result of post-pandemic disruptions, virtually everything has gotten significantly more expensive: food, cars, lumber, equipment, labor. For the most part, the increase in electricity rates nationwide has been in line with overall inflation, although there has been a noticeable acceleration this year.\n\nNational averages can obscure a lot, though, and many states have seen electricity rates rise even faster than inflation, suggesting that there is more to the story.\n\nIn California, average retail prices have risen by a staggering 34 percent since 2019 — even after adjusting for inflation. In New Jersey, prices jumped 11 percent in the past year. In states like Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, prices are rising significantly faster than inflation.\n\nIn Redding, Conn., Janice Rotchstein has noticed electricity prices climb over the past three years. She and her partner have been doing what they can to keep bills in check, including line-drying their clothing, installing more efficient air-conditioning and switching to a different retail electricity provider (something that Connecticut allows). All that helped bring down the bill for their nearly 3,000-square-foot house to $309.68 in September, from $421.85 a year earlier.\n\nEven so, electricity remains one of their biggest monthly expenses. “Our bills have continued to be a problem,” said Ms. Rotchstein, 81. “What we would just love to know is why.”\n\nThe two biggest factors that influence power prices are the cost of generating electricity at a power plant and then delivering those electrons to homes and business through large regional power lines (known as transmission) and the smaller wires snaking through cities (known as distribution).\n\n“When you look at what’s driving electricity bills, it’s really poles and wires,” said Charles Hua, the founder of PowerLines, a nonprofit organization focused on modernizing utility regulations to cut power bills.\n\nInflation-adjusted spending by investor-owned utilities\n\nSource: FERC Form 1 data, compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\nSince 2005, the cost of generating power has declined significantly, partly because the fracking boom has made it much cheaper to extract and burn natural gas, the nation’s largest source of electricity.\n\nBut over that same period, utilities have nearly tripled the amount they spend annually on the network of poles, wires, substations and transformers that deliver power to customers. Large portions of the electric grid are nearing the end of their 50-year life spans and need replacing. Utilities are also hardening lines and equipment to deal with storms, fires and heat waves, particularly as climate change fuels bigger weather disasters.\n\nThis story plays out differently in each state. In California, more than 40 percent of the increase in retail prices since 2019 is attributable to the recent record-breaking wildfires, which have raised insurance costs and forced utilities to replace and upgrade their lines. In Florida, new state laws have required power companies to bury power lines and fortify their electrical substations to prepare for hurricanes.\n\nVarious types of grid equipment — such as transformers — have been in short supply globally and have gotten more expensive. Some critics have accused utilities of overspending on power lines, since they can recoup the costs from customers and earn a guaranteed return, although this can be difficult to quantify.\n\nIn recent years, the United States has seen swift growth in wind and solar power, which together produce 17 percent of the nation’s electricity. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has blamed renewable energy for increasing electricity costs because it can’t run at all hours and requires fossil fuel backup.\n\nYet the Lawrence Berkeley study found a more nuanced story. In regions that have great wind and solar resources — such as the gusty Great Plains or sunny Southwest — renewable energy has boomed and retail electricity prices have either flattened or fallen, after adjusting for inflation. Many of these states, like Iowa or South Dakota, don’t require anyone to use more renewable power; companies build it because it is often the cheapest option to put additional electrons onto the grid.\n\nNote: Prices are for residential electricity, inflation-adjusted to August 2025. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nBut there are exceptions: Several states that aren’t especially windy and sunny have required utilities to buy more electricity from large-scale wind or solar farms, such as Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York. These requirements, which are often adopted to lower greenhouse gas emissions, can add a noticeable surcharge to bills.\n\nMany states — including California, Maine and Massachusetts — have also offered incentives for homeowners to install rooftop solar panels. These policies can raise prices for other customers, because solar households pay less to the utility but still rely on it for backup power. That shifts the cost of maintaining the grid to other households, utilities say. (Solar proponents disagree, saying that this argument ignores many benefits of rooftop panels, such as avoided transmission costs.)\n\nRooftop solar policies accounted for roughly one-quarter of the increase in retail electricity prices in Maine and California since 2019, the Lawrence Berkeley study concluded. More recently, California and some other states have begun paring back their home solar incentives.\n\nYet rising power prices are, in turn, pushing more people toward rooftop solar to lower their bills. Ali Ergun, a 46-year-old hardware engineer, spent around $65,000 this year on solar panels and batteries for his new home in Los Altos Hills, Calif. Solar was not part of Mr. Ergun’s plan when he bought the house, but then he saw his electricity bill, which topped $600 his first month there.\n\n“If you’re at the whims of utility companies’ prices, it’s really a bit nerve wracking,” he said.\n\nOther states have their own stories.\n\nElectricity is expensive in the Northeast because those states rely heavily on imported natural gas and there are a limited number of pipelines into the region, making the fuel costly. (In recent years, New York has blocked new pipelines and closed a nuclear power plant, which deepened the state’s reliance on gas.)\n\nThat left the Northeast vulnerable when gas prices skyrocketed in 2022, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In Maine and Massachusetts, retail prices shot up by more than one-third as a result of these spikes, which have only lately subsided.\n\nIn recent months, many communities have become alarmed by the expansion of massive data centers for artificial intelligence, with some critics warning that these power-hungry facilities will increase electricity costs.\n\nAnd yet in Virginia, home to one of the world’s largest concentrations of data centers, electricity prices have mostly stayed flat over the past six years, adjusting for inflation. If anything, those data centers may have helped suppress prices by allowing utilities to spread the fixed costs of maintaining the grid among a larger set of customers, the Lawrence Berkeley study found.\n\nBut the effects of a rapid data center expansion won’t always be benign, experts cautioned. A lot depends on whether power companies can keep up with the enormous energy needs of new data centers, and whether tech companies or households bear the cost of any needed grid upgrades.\n\nMore ominously, wholesale electric capacity prices have been skyrocketing this year in PJM Interconnection, the large regional grid that supplies Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Virginia. Some analyses have blamed those spikes on new data center demand, which are coming as older coal and nuclear plants are retiring and the grid operator has been slow to connect new renewable and gas plants to replace them.\n\n“Part of the problem is that you can often build new data centers faster than you can build new power plants to supply them,” said Geoffrey Blanford, a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit group that conducts research for the nation’s electric utilities. “And that bottleneck can really drive up costs in the short term.”\n\nThe average price of electricity has been rising faster than inflation this year and government forecasters expect that will continue next year, especially since natural gas prices are starting to climb upward. Politicians are often struggling for answers.\n\nTrump administration officials say the solution is to drill more natural gas and build more pipelines to get that gas where it’s needed.\n\nYet the administration is also trying to make it more difficult and expensive to build new wind and solar projects, while canceling federal grants for grid upgrades aimed at lowering costs. While it will take time for the full impact of those restrictions to be felt, experts say, they are expected to put upward pressure on electricity prices later this decade.\n\nSome states are exploring ways to blunt price shocks by requiring tech companies to absorb more of the cost of adding new data centers or encouraging those data centers to operate more flexibly so that they limit the strain on the grid. Others are considering technological options that could cut costs, such as deploying more batteries.\n\nThe problem is pressing. More than 24 percent of households were unable to pay their energy bills in full in 2024, according to Census Bureau data, up from 20 percent in 2021.\n\n“It’s a perfect storm of misery for low-and-middle income households,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d3kpdp4do","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"00:03:42.928+00:00","title":"Spooky spending creeping in weeks before Halloween","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Halloween spending in the UK is now creeping in weeks before October, driven by social media trends and shifting consumer behavior.

2025-10-30T00:03:42.928+00:00\n\nTitle: Spooky spending creeping in weeks before Halloween\n\n\"It's been our busiest year yet for Halloween,\" says cafe and gift shop owner Charlotte Brennan.\n\n\"People have been asking for pumpkin spiced lattes since August, so I feel like it's getting earlier.\"\n\nCharlotte says as soon as shopping for back-to-school essentials was in the bag, she saw a switch to \"cosy\" autumnal spending.\n\nAnd there is some data to suggest what Charlotte is seeing is a wider trend of Halloween spending creeping in long before 31 October.\n\nMore than £100m was spent on sugar confectionery at British supermarkets in the four weeks to 5 October - up 5% on the same period a year ago, according to data from Worldpanel by Numerator.\n\nIts figures also suggest more than a million shoppers had already bought pumpkins from the supermarkets by the start of October, with sales totalling £1.4m in the four weeks prior, doubling the amount spent in the similar pre-Halloween period in 2023.\n\nCharlotte, who owns Bloom & Brew in Ormskirk says Halloween is now her second-busiest time of year, after Christmas.\n\nShe says social media food and decor trends heavily influence what and when people buy for Halloween and on TikTok \"the build-up starts in July\".\n\n\"For our sales, where previously it was just a two-week period from mid-October to the 31st, now it's much longer - people want pumpkins and decorations.\"\n\nMs Brennan says many of her customers bought one or two reusable decorative items for the season to build a collection, as they do for Christmas.\n\n\"When I was growing up, you'd get a couple of plastic throwaway items from the supermarket in the days before Halloween, and then they were binned,\" she says.\n\nOverall spending on Halloween hit £2bn two years ago and is predicted to grow again this year. In 2024, as many as 91% of people bought something Halloween-related, Worldpanel's data suggests.\n\nIt's too early for this year's full Halloween spending data but last year's Worldpanel figures suggest the spooky spending period is getting longer.\n\nThere was a 37% growth in retail spending on categories associated with Halloween and autumn in the two weeks leading up to October 31 2024, compared with a standard two-week period.\n\nAnd it's not just sellers of costumes and sweet treats benefiting: candles and pyjama sales were up nearly 20% too.\n\nVikash Kaansili, senior retail analyst at Kantar ,says the data suggests Halloween spending is about more than dressing up and carving pumpkins.\n\n\"Halloween is no longer just for kids. The growth in sales of pyjamas and candles suggests adults are embracing Halloween as an opportunity for a night in at home, not just for children's trick-or-treating.\n\n\"Despite cost-of-living pressures, Halloween continues to prove resilient,\" Mr Kaansili says.\n\n\"Shoppers made more trips in the two weeks leading up to Halloween [2024] and spent 16% more than they usually do, suggesting it's a \"must-do\" occasion that people are unwilling to cut back on.\n\nPumpkins remain the unofficial symbol of Halloween, and we're buying them earlier. Worldpanel data found in the four weeks to 29 September 2024, just under £1m was spent on pumpkins in British supermarkets, nearly doubling figures for the same period in 2023.\n\nSupermarket Asda said this year it is on track to sell 400,000 mini, or \"munchkin\" pumpkins - for use in displays rather than in the kitchen - up from 200,000 last year.\n\nAnd it's not just supermarkets and retailers getting in on the action: leisure and entertainment businesses now see it as a season in itself.\n\nFiona Eastwood, the boss of Merlin Entertainment, which owns Thorpe Park, Alton Towers and Legoland told the BBC that the lead up to Halloween now rivals its peak summer season in driving profits at some sites.\n\n\"Take Thorpe Park: increasingly Halloween is almost half of its annual profit and that's because we have special rides in the dark, you have mazes, and that whole thrill that we're tapping into,\" she told the BBC's  Big Boss Interview podcast .\n\nThe season's popularity has also allowed other businesses, such as farming, to diversify.\n\nThe Halloween pumpkin patch has more than doubled at Andy Owens' farm in Herefordshire after the sheep and crop farmer set it up in 2021.\n\n\"Pumpkins for us only use a small amount of land, but generate income in October in what can be a volatile month.\n\n\"It's snowballed. When we set up only four years ago, there were only two others in the county. Now there are many more.\"\n\nHe charges £5 per person and after initial growth, visitor numbers are up around 10% so far in 2025 compared with last year.\n\n\"We're told the economy isn't doing well, but families still want a day out and we see that they still have money for pumpkins,\" he says.\n\nOwens' five-acre pumpkin patch expanded last year to include a horror maze that employs local actors.\n\n\"Halloween in this country has grown massively. When I was growing up there was barely trick-or-treating, there was just The Simpsons Halloween special [on TV]. Now it's everywhere,\" he says."}]}
