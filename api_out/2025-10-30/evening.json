for decades, never more so than when  Donald Trump  is in office.\n \n\n   \n  Prone to flattery and enamored by gold, Trump has inspired gifts both outlandish and personal, touching and — in at least one case — slightly macabre.\n \n\n   \n  Across Asia this week, Trump received presents that had been carefully selected by new leaders eager to solidify their relationships with their most powerful, and often rather temperamental, ally.\n \n\n   \n  Their choices reflected the deliberate calculations leaders make as they work to demonstrate respect and create a surprise while also showing they understand the recipient — who can be highly attuned to how he’s treated.\n \n\n   \n  The hope is that their efforts will inspire a degree of goodwill that might translate, eventually, into favorable trade deals or new pledges of security cooperation. At a minimum, it makes for a good photo-op.\n \n\n   \n  Ethics laws mean the gifts are actually the property of the American public, and are usually handed over to the General Services Administration, though a president can purchase them back at market value. Democrats accused Trump of failing to properly account for some gifts received during his first term.\n \n\n   \n  Wherever they end up, the gifts Trump has received during his second term reflect how eager his counterparts are to leave a good impression.

We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better. And he says those families are motivating him to raise another $1 million in half the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-nikola-topic-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00Z","title":"Oklahoma City Thunder Guard Nikola Topic Diagnosed With Testicular Cancer and Undergoing Chemotherapy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma City Thunder guard Nikola Topic has been diagnosed with testicular cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy, with the diagnosis announced by team general manager Sam Presti on October 30, 2025.

Said-Moorhouse, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:48 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles has started a process to strip Prince Andrew of his titles and given him notice to move out of his mansion, Buckingham Palace said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It comes as  Prince Andrew  has failed to quell the scandal over his association with disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The publication of a posthumous memoir, “Nobody’s Girl,” by his accuser Virginia Giuffre put a spotlight back onto the allegations against Andrew. Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – said in  the memoir  that Andrew sexually assaulted her while she was a teenager. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Buckingham Palace went further in censuring Andrew, saying in a statement: “His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew.”\n \n\n   \n  “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands Andrew will be moving to a property on the private Sandringham estate. Any future accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It requires an act of parliament to formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democrats-leave-classified-briefing-on-us-military-strikes-unsatisfied-after-pentagon-pulls-lawyers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00Z","title":"Democrats leave classified briefing on US military strikes unsatisfied after Trump administration pulls Pentagon lawyers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrats are deeply frustrated with the Trump administration's refusal to provide full transparency regarding recent U.S. military strikes on suspected drug boats in the western hemisphere.

The briefing came a day after  Democrats say they were shut out of another meeting  where administration officials shared information on the strikes with their Republican colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “Am I leaving satisfied? Absolutely not. And the last word that I gave to the admiral was, ‘I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in and the peril you are putting our troops in’,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts told reporters of the Thursday briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “What I heard here today was a tactical brief. I heard no strategy, no end game, no assessment of how they are going to end the flow of drugs into the United States, which needs to happen, by the way,” Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, who sits on the House Armed Services and the Intelligence committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Fuming at a separate press conference over his accusation that the White House  cut Democrats out  of a Wednesday briefing, Sen. Mark Warner had an even sharper take: “bullsh*t.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be blunt, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive, not only to our democracy, but downright dangerous for our national security,” Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in recent weeks has accelerated its attacks against boats they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly criticized the administration for failing to provide them with enough information related to those strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has defended its information sharing with Congress, telling CNN earlier this week it has given  seven separate classified briefings  on the strikes to various committees. But the information that Pentagon officials have offered so far on those attacks during closed-door briefings has largely fueled more questions and concerns from Democrats about the administration’s legal justification for them – especially as only select Republicans have been allowed to see the classified legal opinion detailing that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats said the information provided to them Thursday fell short of what they needed to provide proper congressional checks on the president’s war powers.\n \n\n   \n  “I sit on the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee. Our job is to oversee the use of lethal force by our military outside of the United States, and I’m walking away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate here,” Crow said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California similarly said “the level of transparency was not OK” and added that “there’s nothing that we heard in there that changes my assessment that this is completely illegal, that it is unlawful and even if Congress authorized it, it would still be illegal because there are extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  The briefers, Jacobs said, only cited Article II as the legal justification for the strikes and said they didn’t know the identities of all of the individuals involved in them. They also told lawmakers that cocaine was the only narcotic targeted in the strikes so far and claimed it is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl,” according to the congresswoman. “It was not a satisfactory answer for most of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the Democratic ranking members, Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees attended the meeting but declined to comment to reporters afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Mike Rogers, the Armed Services chairman, would only tell CNN he expects an additional briefing.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans defend need for bipartisan briefings\n \n\n   \n  Still, several Senate Republicans said Democrats should have been invited to Wednesday’s briefing on the Caribbean boat strikes, though they insisted their exclusion wasn’t malicious.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an unfortunate situation, and I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way. It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis,” Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Rounds added that his understanding was that several GOP senators had requested a further briefing on the legality of the strikes, and other Republicans, including him, also asked to be included.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got into the meeting, I realized that there were people from a lot of different committees, but I couldn’t identify the group in particular, but there were no Democrats there,” he said. “And so afterwards, we went back and followed up. The White House called us and said, ‘Yeah, this was a separate meeting. It was asked for by one of your colleagues.’ We just happen to have also been invited to it, and that is consistent with what we saw.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Kevin Cramer agreed that his Democratic colleagues should have access to the same briefings as Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that any administration should leave out any party from a briefing of that level of importance. And I think their justification — you can argue it, and no doubt people will — but I don’t think that something of that importance shouldn’t be shared. Whether it’s legal justification or if there’s — if there are details about who are on these boats and what these boats are containing, you know, the tactics, I think all of that should be available to people who oversee the Pentagon,” Cramer said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats didn’t hide their their frustration with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally unprecedented in my 15 years of service in the United States Senate that intelligence briefings on a matter of this consequence would be held for one party alone,” said an angry Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes to this administration concealing the facts and worrying about the law.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/january-6-doj-memo-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:38:00Z","title":"Trump’s push to retcon January 6 takes an especially brazen turn","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s Justice Department has been actively attempting to rewrite the historical narrative of January 6, 2021, by removing references to the event as a riot or insurrection from official legal documents.

\n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:28 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Shortly after the  January 6, 2021, attack  on the US Capitol, the political right spent a lot of time parsing whether the word “insurrection” was an apt description of the day’s events.\n \n\n   \n  Today, President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is apparently  sanctioning its own prosecutors  for calling January 6 a mere “mob of rioters.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to fully convey just how brazen Trump’s efforts to rewrite the history of the day have become. He’s spent years trying to turn people who launched the worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries into sympathetic figures. He even pardoned a bunch of people who assaulted police that day, despite  more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that .\n \n\n   \n  But sometimes something comes along that completely drives the whole thing home.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what happened this week, in the  case of Taylor Taranto .\n \n\n   \n  To recap: Taranto was among those pardoned by Trump for his actions on January 6. But before that pardon, he committed an unrelated crime. In 2023, he was arrested in former President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood with numerous firearms and materials to make explosives. He was convicted in May.\n \n\n   \n  By late Tuesday, a reporter at Politico noted something interesting: Prosecutors in their sentencing memo for Taranto noted his presence in the “mob of rioters” on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building,” the  sentencing memo  said. “After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  This wouldn’t normally be surprising, mind you. It’s a factual statement that notes the defendant isn’t a newcomer to legal trouble.\n \n\n   \n  But it  was  notable next to Trump’s own rhetoric about January 6 – and given the Trump DOJ’s efforts to  force out a batch of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, mere hours later the prosecutors on the case – Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White – were  placed on leave . Then their sentencing memo was pulled from the docket and replaced with a new one, signed by different prosecutors, that excised the paragraph on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  And just in case it wasn’t clear that the changes were made to benefit Trump, consider another change to the sentencing memo.\n \n\n   \n  The other interesting aspect of Taranto’s crime is Trump’s proximity to it. In fact, Taranto was apprehended near Obama’s home  shortly after Trump reshared a post that included an alleged address for the former president  to social media. Prosecutors said Taranto began livestreaming in the area shortly after promoting Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The new sentencing memo also removed a reference to that fact.\n \n\n   \n  We still have plenty to learn about what happened here. But it’s one of the most glaring examples of the fruits of Trump’s long-running campaign to retcon January 6 – and to turn it into anything other than a tragic day for our country and our democracy.\n \n\n   \n  After the dust settled on that day, Trump and some allies in Congress began suggestively questioning how violent the day was, with one GOP congressman infamously comparing it to a “ normal tourist visit .”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump launched his 2024 campaign, he began featuring a  music video from a choir of January 6 defendants  that effectively lionized them. He began talking about the defendants as if they were ill-treated political “hostages,” often  citing misinformation  in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Then he, on his first day back in office, pardoned nearly all of them – even the worst offenders.\n \n\n   \n  But that was merely the first step.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve also seen a  purge of dozens of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases, despite them merely enforcing the law. Trump’s Justice Department agreed to  settle a wrongful death suit for $5 million with the family of Ashli Babbitt , who was killed after breaking into a sensitive area of the Capitol, cementing her status as a martyr for some portions of the extreme right. The administration has also  pressured the Smithsonian , which has in some cases  softened its language about the events that day . The president and allies have continued to overhype  relatively minor   disclosures  about the government’s actions vis-a-vis January 6, which took place while Trump was in office, as if they proved a massive conspiracy against Trump and the GOP. The House is now undertaking an investigation that  appears aimed at recasting the narrative  of that day.\n \n\n   \n  Oh, and we recently learned Trump is reportedly  seeking $230 million  from his own government for alleged damages from the January 6 probe and other federal investigations. (Trump was never tried in these cases, which were dropped after he was reelected president, but nor was he acquitted.)\n \n\n   \n  If anything epitomizes Trump’s attempts to turn those who fueled what happened on January 6 into victims, it’s surely that. Even if you don’t think Trump committed a crime, the people who attacked the Capitol were clearly spurred by his lies about voter fraud and the supposedly stolen election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump just keeps pushing the envelope here, and we keep seeing that manifest itself in actions by his Justice Department and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  The question from there is whether he’s able to actually rewrite history in Americans’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  To this point, that’s been  a tough slog . Trump’s pardons of violent January 6 defendants were overwhelmingly unpopular. Strong majorities of Americans still regard that day as an attack against democracy.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a steady downgrading of the right’s views on that day.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-2021, a Monmouth University poll showed 62% of Republicans labeled that day a “riot,” and 33% called it an “insurrection.” Two years later, though, those numbers  dropped significantly – to 44% and 15%, respectively .\n \n\n   \n  In that way, the erasure of the “mob of rioters” from the memo reflects how the political right has come to view that day.\n \n\n   \n  But that doesn’t mean it’s a reflection of the truth.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/justice-edited-court-documents-trump-january-6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00Z","title":"Orwellian: Current and former prosecutors alarmed after DOJ scrubs mentions of Trump and January 6 from court records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department removed all references to Donald Trump’s social media post about Barack Obama’s address and Taylor Taranto’s involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot from a sentencing memo, prompting the suspension of two prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White.

‘Orwellian’: Current and former prosecutors alarmed after DOJ scrubs mentions of Trump and January 6 from court records \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:32 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department’s decision to sideline two US attorneys and remove mentions of Donald Trump and the US Capitol attack from court papers before the sentencing of a pardoned January 6 rioter is being viewed by former and current career prosecutors as an alarming whitewashing of history.\n \n\n   \n  The events around the case of Taylor Taranto, who was convicted of bringing illegal guns near Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, residence after talking online about violence toward the federal government, has shocked the network of Justice Department employees and alumni, several sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June 2023 after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator the day before, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and others’ homes.\n \n\n   \n  He had also been present at the Capitol riot and charged with related crimes, though he was never convicted because Trump pardoned him before a trial. He has already spent 23 months behind bars and hasn’t been detained since he was pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump appointee, had found him guilty at trial in May of the gun crimes and for making a false threat to use a car bomb against a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  In a  sentencing memo for Taranto filed Tuesday , prosecutors Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White wrote that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s original post – which included the Obama address – was itself a repost of a blog article.\n \n\n   \n  Politico reporter Kyle Cheney highlighted the filing and mentioned it also included Taranto taking part in the January 6 riot, on the social media platform X late Tuesday night. Within 24 hours, the court filing was no longer available in the court record and the two prosecutors who had signed it were suspended from their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  Two new prosecutors then  filed an amended version  of the sentencing memo to the court on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  That new memo scrubbed all references to Trump and him posting Obama’s supposed address – which Taranto had reposted – as well as Taranto’s participation and conviction related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s shocking that prosecutors could be put on leave for accurately stating the court record in a sentencing memo, and it’s just as shocking that those truthful statements have been whitewashed in a revised filing,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney and now executive director and founder of Justice Connection, which works to represent the viewpoints of former federal prosecutors, especially those who have been fired by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These prosecutors did their job and upheld their duty of candor by informing the court of clearly established facts relevant to their case,” Young added.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Orwellian’\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the moves made by the Justice Department had employees reeling within the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the FBI, which had investigated and caught Taranto, believing he was a danger to the public in 2023, people familiar with the office told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One source called the sentencing memo change “Orwellian.”\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia had no indication he may have employment issues — especially given that on Tuesday, the day before his suspension, he helped to secure a guilty verdict from a jury in a fraud case where he was on the trial team, according to two people familiar with the US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, White is a supervisor on Superior Court cases and was a US Marine.\n \n\n   \n  A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday following the suspensions: “While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously. We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n    Taranto sentenced to 21 months\n \n\n   \n  When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing Thursday, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison, essentially covered by time served.\n \n\n   \n  Nichols found that Taranto “made troubling statements” in his online livestream but noted he had no criminal history and his conduct “was far from egregious.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, not to apologize for his conduct but to highlight a book on the 1787 constitutional convention and mention that some people questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to keep people’s minds open,” he concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also said he thought the two prosecutors placed on leave “upheld the highest standard” throughout the case.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that they did a commendable and exceptional job,” Nichols said of the prosecutors, adding that he felt “they did a truly excellent job in this case.”\n \n\n   \n  White and Valdivia attended Taranto’s sentencing and declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/credit-scores-medical-debt-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:49:00Z","title":"Trump team takes aim at state laws shielding consumers’ credit scores from medical debt","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, issued new guidance in October 2025 that asserts federal authority over consumer credit reporting under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, effectively blocking state laws that shield medical debt from appearing on credit reports.

from medical debt \n       \n  By Noam N. Levey, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:49 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration took another step Tuesday to weaken protections for Americans with medical debt, issuing new guidance that threatens ongoing state efforts to keep that debt off consumers’ credit reports.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen states, including Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Maryland, New York, and most of New England, have enacted laws in recent years to keep medical debt from affecting consumers’ credit.\n \n\n   \n  And more states — including several in conservative regions of the Midwest and Mountain West —  have been considering  similar protections, spurred by bipartisan concerns that medical debt on a credit report can make it harder for people to get a home, a car, or a job.\n \n\n   \n  Nationwide,  about 100 million people  have some form of health care debt, with millions burdened by $10,000 or more in unpaid bills.\n \n\n   \n  But  in the new guidance , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asserts that federal law bars states from restricting medical debts from credit reports, arguing that only the federal government has this authority.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress meant to occupy the field of consumer reporting and displace state laws,” the bureau concluded in an “interpretive rule” signed by Russell Vought, the White House budget director and acting head of the CFPB.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance, which offers a new interpretation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, reverses policies advanced under former President Joe Biden that sought to empower states to expand protections for people with medical debt.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s latest move will not immediately roll back existing state protections.\n \n\n   \n  But advocates for patients and consumers warn that the new guidance may stall progress elsewhere, just as millions of Americans are poised to lose federal aid that helps them buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The aid is tied up in the current budget showdown between congressional Republicans and Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a crueler regulatory interpretation,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president for the Community Service Society of New York. The nonprofit has pushed for medical debt protections in that state.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Culp, who oversees state lobbying efforts by Blood Cancer United, formerly known as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, warned that the Trump administration’s guidance could reverberate across the country. “This rule will have a chilling effect on states’ willingness to pass these critical patient protections,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The new CFPB guidance might spur more litigation challenging state restrictions on medical debt credit reporting.\n \n\n   \n  Trade groups representing credit reporting agencies and debt collectors went to court early this year challenging  regulations issued by the Biden administration  that would have removed medical debt from credit reports nationwide. They argued that the administration exceeded its authority in issuing the credit reporting restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal restrictions would have helped an estimated 15 million people. But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations, and a federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulations should be scrapped. They never went into effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit agencies and has argued that regulating medical debt should be left to the federal government, welcomed the new guidance from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “There should be one national standard to govern how information is provided to consumer reporting agencies and what information can appear on a consumer’s credit report,” association president Dan Smith said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Broader health insurance protections could prevent more Americans from sinking into debt and depressing their credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  But millions of Americans  are expected  to lose health coverage in the coming years as a result of the tax and spending bill signed by the president in July.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Americans are avoiding medical care, putting off needed surgeries, skipping essential treatments,” said Allison Sesso, president and chief executive of Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that buys up and retires patients’ debts and advocates for broader patient protections.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t just a health care issue,” Sesso added. “It’s an economic crisis that’s keeping families from building wealth and fully participating in the economy.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Failing to win Senate approval as US Attorney for Washington, DC, has made Ed Martin a more formidable force inside the Trump Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After three chaotic months as interim US attorney earlier this year, Justice Department officials placed Martin in the department’s headquarters in a traditionally more supervised position. Unconfirmable and intent on rewriting the consequences of the January 6 prosecutions, Martin was, as one Trump ally said, being put under more “adult supervision.”\n \n\n   \n  That move, though, didn’t appear to hold him back. Martin now wields a surprising amount of political power and four titles: Associate Deputy Attorney General, Pardon Attorney, director of the Weaponization Working Group and Special Attorney for Mortgage Fraud. He’s also become the chief enforcer of using the Justice Department to exact President Donald Trump’s personal agenda — including by playing a role behind the scenes in the recent indictments of Trump foes  James Comey  and  Letitia James,  delving into so-called “weaponization” within the federal government and Biden-era pardons, and continuing to bear down on others Trump wants to see investigated.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Martin told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee that he was working on an “ongoing investigation” of pardons and commutations during Joe Biden’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, which adds fuel to Trump’s attacks of presidential clemency given to members of the House Select Committee that investigated January 6 and others before they faced charges, recasts the traditional role of a pardon attorney in the extreme. Previously the job focused on reviewing and making recommendations to the president after prisoners petitioned for clemency. Under Martin, it’s become a much more active, politicized approach, where he is now critiquing past presidents’ clemency, a Constitutional power that has few limitations.\n \n\n   \n  “My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staff and perhaps others is troubling,” Martin wrote to committee chairman James Comer, according to an email to obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Justice Department has previously said a president’s use of an autopen is legally sound.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s influence also has become evident in cases where career prosecutors have balked at charging Trump political opponents and which his bosses, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, had reservations about before bringing.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, prosecutions of Comey and  James  have moved ahead over the protests of career prosecutors and even some Trump political appointees. Firings and resignations by experienced prosecutors have followed, and Martin has been in close contact with  Lindsey Halligan , whom Trump placed as the lead US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who initiated those indictments, sources tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, Martin has turned his focus toward building his connections to other US Attorneys’ Offices, including in Atlanta, St. Louis and upstate New York, according to sources familiar with Martin’s efforts. Some of that effort may include known probes around Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has tried to fire, on mortgage fraud allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Ed Martin is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice Department. He’s not a serious lawyer, but he has serious power,” said Liz Oyer, a former career Justice Department official who preceded Martin as pardon attorney. “He seemingly has the power to open criminal investigations, which is serious business. Being subject to a criminal investigation can ruin someone’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  Oyer noted that investigating Trump’s political opponents and holding the pardon post gives Martin especially unusual influence — as a political force who can both punish Trump’s enemies and reward his friends.\n \n\n   \n  His willingness to use the Justice Department to advance MAGA movement politics stands in contrast with the Justice Department norms since the Richard Nixon era. Reforms after the Watergate crisis led to a tradition under Republican and Democratic administrations to distance prosecution decisions from the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the first Trump administration, attorneys general generally enforced rules limiting contact between White House officials and Justice Department employees.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has no such qualms and is known to maintain regular contact with White House officials, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A Missouri Republican, Martin burnished his MAGA credentials following the 2021 Capital attack, becoming a vocal defender of Trump vote fraud claims in the 2020 election and of January 6 rioters — some of whom he represented as an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  As part of his so-called weaponization probe, Martin brought onto his staff former FBI agent Jared Wise, who was prosecuted for allegedly urging January 6 rioters to attack law enforcement officers, calling the officers “Nazis” and the “Gestapo.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin maintains at least two offices at the Justice Department – one in a complex north of the US Capitol where the pardon attorney office is located, the other inside the Justice Department headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  His active social media presence including a Substack blog and his support for January 6 rioters caused wary Senate Republicans to tank his nomination to lead the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington, DC, which prosecuted more than 1,000 January 6 riot defendants, in May.\n \n\n   \n  But Martin appears undaunted despite receiving cautions from top Justice officials about some of his public comments.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Martin has been posting nearly every day on social media photos of people he meets with, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the comedian Russel Brand, US Attorneys from outside of DC, and Trump supporters in politics from around the country.\n \n\n   \n  He also has been lobbying prosecutors in Maryland to pursue mortgage fraud allegations around Democratic California Sen.  Adam Schiff,  another one of Trump’s political opponents, who helped lead congressional investigations of him, sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department and Martin didn’t comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Martin sought to flex his influence earlier this month as former New York Rep. George Santos won a sentence commutation from the president, after serving in a minimal-security federal prison camp only three months of his seven-year sentence for fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Santos for months had sought the help of intermediaries to get Trump’s attention for a pardon and Martin tried to help behind the scenes, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  After the president granted the commutation, Martin said in a post on X: “I was honored as U.S. Pardon Attorney to have played a small role” in the clemency grant, and he thanks the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  “Martin has made it known that his intent with pardons is to use them to benefit people with MAGA affiliations,” Oyer said. “For Martin to have both of those roles,” of pardon attorney and prosecutor, “it shows how this department is operating a system of both punishment and reward.”\n \n\n   \n    Catching Trump’s attention\n \n\n   \n  Some of Martin’s recent campaigns have been channeled into the president’s own social media feed. For instance, with Martin as the mortgage fraud investigator, Trump lashed out at Bondi, demanding in a  remarkable Truth Social  post for the prosecution of his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Blanche has sought to bring a measure of control to Martin’s efforts, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The tension between Blanche and Martin spilled out into the public in late September, after Martin sent a letter to an FBI agent who had responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Martin, in his letter, disclosed what he said was an investigation of the agent, after the agent had testified about being smeared in a conspiracy theory pushed by Jones, who gained notoriety with claims that the Sand Hook attack was staged by the FBI. The agent was awarded nearly $100 million in a case against Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Jones made Martin’s letter public, demanding responses from the FBI agent, until Blanche demanded Martin retract his requests.\n \n\n   \n  Martin then wrote to the agent’s lawyer, “I write to inform you that there is no investigation of you or your client. Because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”\n \n\n   \n    An ally in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  But Martin’s power has accrued alongside the arrival of another former Trump adviser, Halligan, who Trump installed to run the powerful US Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, in late September.\n \n\n   \n  While career prosecutors and top Justice officials viewed cases against Comey and James to be duds, Halligan managed to deliver the two indictments Trump publicly called for.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan replaced Erik Seibert after attorneys in the office objected to charging Comey with lying to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Both Comey and James have pleaded not guilty and are challenging the prosecutors’ handling of the cases.\n \n\n   \n  In the James investigation before she was charged, Martin took several steps that fall outside the norms of prosecutorial conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Martin this summer sent a letter to James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, suggesting that James should resign as attorney general. And he paid a visit to James’ Brooklyn  home  in August, posing for photos outside it wearing a long trench coat, accompanied by an assistant who acts as an unofficial spokesperson, unusual for a person in Martin’s position to have at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only going to hold them accountable. We’re also going to look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing,” Martin said on Fox News in August when asked about the mortgage investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Some senior DOJ officials were frustrated by the stunt, one source said, as they had no idea Martin would be traveling to New York.\n \n\n   \n    Attention in Maryland\n \n\n   \n  Apparently emboldened by the charging successes in Virginia, Martin’s fast-moving advocacy turned in recent weeks to Maryland’s US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The office’s US Attorney Kelly Hayes, a respected career prosecutor who worked for years out of Greenbelt, recently secured the indictment of former Trump national security adviser  John Bolton , another Trump political foe. Prosecutors accuse Bolton of keeping national security secrets in unsecured personal accounts and on printed paper after he left the government.\n \n\n   \n  Hayes’ approach, and the Bolton case itself, are viewed more seriously than the indictments and investigations of other political figures who have faced charges at Trump’s urging, several sources familiar with the case and the office have told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the Maryland office still has a prosecutor looking into the financial records of Schiff, another Trump target, and Martin continues to push Hayes to bring an indictment against him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week after it became known Hayes’ team had doubts about the case, sources said the investigation was continuing and the Deputy Attorney General’s office may be working with Hayes, in a vote of confidence for the US Attorney in a precarious moment.\n \n\n   \n  Yet because of Martin’s pushes for prosecution in Maryland and Virginia, the districts are now buzzing with speculation Martin could end up as a prosecutor in one of the offices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:46:00-04:00","title":"Teacher Shot by 6-Year-Old Student Testifies in $40 Million Lawsuit Against Former Assistant Principal","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a civil trial in Newport News, Virginia, first-grade teacher Abby Zwerner testified about being shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student on January 6, 2023, at Richneck Elementary School.

I thought I had died,” Abby Zwerner said Thursday, shortly before her attorneys rested their case, recounting the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner raised her hand instinctively as she realized what the student was going to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The look on the student’s face is the large memory that I have,” Zwerner said Thursday. “It was like a very blank look, but it wasn’t a blank look at all.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN All Access has live coverage of teacher shot by student trial \n \n\n   \n  One of Zwerner’s last memories at the school the day she was shot, she said, was thinking, “I was on my way to heaven or in heaven.”\n \n\n   \n  “My next memory is I see two coworkers around me,” Zwerner said. “I process that I’m hurt, and they’re putting pressure on where I’m hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial offers a peek inside some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n  Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare, a law professor at the University of Virginia told CNN, and this case could set a precedent for future events as US communities grapple with questions of responsibility after a school is scarred by gun violence.\n \n\n   \n  It remains an increasingly pervasive problem: As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States so far this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n    Official ignored warning signs, lawsuit alleges\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner described the consequences of the physical trauma wrought by the shooting. Because of her injury, which prompted multiple surgeries, Zwerner is unable to fully use her left hand to this day, she said. \n \n\n   \n  “Overall, I would say I do struggle with things, doing things,” she said, like opening a bag of chips and water bottles. \n \n\n   \n  She also testified to lingering emotional trauma such as being afraid to go out in public with her mother and sister and feeling distant from friends. \n \n\n   \n  “I just want to stay home,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The  lawsuit alleges  Parker ignored concerns raised by several teachers and staff members, including that the student may have had a gun in his possession hours before the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Parker is accused of ignoring “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and that the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  A guidance counselor and administrator at the school said Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his mother would pick him up soon, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was required to be accompanied by a parent at school “because of his violent tendencies.” But the day of the shooting, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  During the previous school year, the boy strangled and choked a teacher and pulled up a female classmate’s dress and touched her inappropriately on the school playground, the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led up to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment. On Thursday, during cross-examination, an attorney for Parker worked to undercut Zwerner’s claims about the shooting, limiting her willingness to go out in public.   \n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had attended concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until after her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal was reassigned to another school. The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher’s witnesses describe emotional toll\n \n\n   \n  The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Zwerner wiped away tears as her twin sister reflected Wednesday on the   changes she’s seen in Zwerner since the first-grade teacher was shot by her 6-year-old student more than two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner told the court, saying the shooting dimmed a sister who used to be a bright light.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot to be excited about. And she doesn’t anymore.”\n \n\n   \n    Injuries were devastating\n \n\n   \n  The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.\n \n\n   \n  After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.\n \n\n   \n  A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.\n \n\n   \n    School official is only defendant\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the others, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was  sentenced  to a total of nearly four years in prison for    child neglect and federal weapons charges.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was  not charged  with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother  previously told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  However, prosecutors  later said  authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock. The boy stood on a dresser drawer and took the gun from his mother’s purse.  ﻿ He then brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s mother had no criminal record and cooperated with authorities since the shooting. She  turned herself in  to police after state charges were filed  against her and was released after posting a $5,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n    Case could set precedent\n \n\n   \n  Because attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, this case could set a precedent, said Darryl K.

30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight over the Trump administration’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to help cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” US District Judge Indira Talwani said near the end of a hearing, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Though the judge’s options vary, one possibility is that she issues an emergency order that essentially compels the administration to tap into the emergency funds. While she indicated from the bench that she was likely to issue a ruling favorable to a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors who sued the administration earlier this week, she acknowledged that benefits, which should start being sent to recipients on November 1, will be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani said she would work quickly to issue her decision later Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps, a critical piece of the  nation’s safety net.  The program costs roughly $8.5 billion to $9 billion a month, while the contingency fund now has about $5.3 billion in it, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which is representing USDA in the case.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge orders the government to use the emergency funds, it will take time for the US Department of Agriculture and states to get their systems up and running again, which means at least some beneficiaries will likely have to wait for the November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also unclear whether recipients will receive their full November benefits since the USDA’s contingency fund does not have enough money to cover the entire payments without drawing from other resources. But the Trump administration has shifted money to fund other priorities during the shutdown, including transferring $300 million to keep the  WIC food assistance program  for pregnant women, new moms and young children afloat for October.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the discussion during Thursday’s hearing centered around the fact that the contingency fund contains far less than what is needed to fully cover November benefits for the millions of Americans who receive them. The judge said multiple times that federal law made clear that when the government is unable to pay benefits, it should reduce what it provides, not suspend the program altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “It does seem to me really clear what Congress was trying to do,” Talwani said. “What Congress was trying to do is protect the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger, Talwani added.\n \n\n   \n  A group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC,  sued the administration on Tuesday   over the US Department of Agriculture’s recent decision to not tap into the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, USDA said that it was unable to use the rainy-day fund, reversing course from earlier agency guidance that said such a move was possible. In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene on an emergency basis to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  In the food stamps case, the attorneys general and governors argued the administration was violating federal law that requires the government to consistently fund the food stamps program and that its decision to not tap into the contingency fund ran afoul of federal rulemaking laws.\n \n\n   \n  “USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits,” they wrote in the lawsuit. “Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information – ranging from a week before the start of the month to the first day of the month – in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to acknowledging the likely delay in benefits, the judge on Thursday also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Massachusetts told Talwani that it would be up to the states to figure out how to reduce payments based on the available federal funds, but an attorney representing the Trump administration pushed back strongly on that idea.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department lawyer, Jason Altabet, said that while it was up to USDA officials to make decisions on reductions in benefit amounts, the agency was extremely concerned about the prospect of having to do that work.\n \n\n   \n    Changing positions\n \n\n   \n  In its shutdown contingency plan, which has since been taken offline, USDA indicated that the contingency fund can be used for benefits in case of a lapse. The plan noted that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue.”\n \n\n   \n  But on October 10, the agency began raising red flags, informing states that there is  not enough money  to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues and asking them to hold off on next month’s payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins doubled down on that position the following week, telling reporters that food stamps will run dry by the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  And last week, the USDA said it  will not tap into the fund , stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/scream-stranger-things-trailers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:35:00Z","title":"‘Tis the (spooky) season: ‘Scream 7’ and ‘Stranger Things 5’ trailers deliver double dose of scares","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Halloween Eve 2025, trailers for 'Scream 7' and 'Stranger Things 5' were released, targeting fans of horror and sci-fi genres.

popular stop for Democrats with eyes on 2028 \n       \n  By Arlette Saenz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:43 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  2025 campaign trail  has become a popular stop for potential 2028 presidential hopefuls looking to help the Democratic Party’s candidates for governor.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Buttigieg joined Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey Thursday morning to criticize President Donald Trump’s threats to cancel a major commuter rail project connecting her state and New York City. In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona appeared with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent backer of Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani . And in California,  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign  to push through mid-decade redistricting in his state has further propelled him into the national conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re thinking about future campaigns, it’s smart to have a strategy that’s not just about going to the primary states but also showing that you’re a team player in the Democratic Party and that your message can help turn voters out,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for the Democratic Governors Association.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Buttigieg, a former transportation secretary, touted his work with Sherrill to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel project, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City that Trump said he had “terminated” earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg described the move as “mob boss politics” and criticized Sherrill’s  Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli  for not having “the backbone” to push back on the president.\n \n\n   \n  “This state needs a governor who can think for herself, and someone who will put the best interest of the state first. And there’s only one candidate who will do that,” Buttigieg said at an event with Sherrill at a Westfield, NJ, train station.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg was slated later Thursday to help turn out voters in Red Bank and raise money for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the  Latino vote could be key  to picking the next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, all we want is to have a chance at the American Dream, to be able to build a family here, to have a chance to continue to grow this country and the beautiful vision that everyone has,” Gallego said Thursday at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event in Alexandria, Virginia. “And this is why we as Latinos have to come out and vote today and all the way until Tuesday, because the only way we get that dream is when we have friends that care about us.”\n \n\n   \n    Big names out on the campaign trail for Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Several sitting Democratic governors potentially eyeing higher office have descended on New Jersey and Virginia to give a boost to the women they hope will join their ranks next year. That includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  “The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  has been a frequent surrogate for Sherrill in his home state. Other high-profile Democratic surrogates who have hit the campaign trail in New Jersey or Virginia this year include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; California Rep. Ro Khanna and former US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who is now a CNN commentator.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the type of leaders that are focused on the everyday problems, the everyday concerns of Americans, and that can be the type of leaders that re-earn the faith of the American people,” Beshear, vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said of Sherrill and Spanberger during a virtual event with the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have helped raise money for the off-year candidates. Newsom, who has said he will make a  decision about 2028  after the midterms, participated in a virtual fundraiser with Sherrill for New Jersey’s Democratic campaigns and state committee, a source familiar with the event said. Meanwhile, Pritzker has donated six-figures across the New Jersey and Virginia races, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  While 2028 hopefuls on the Democratic side have eagerly stumped during this year’s off-year elections, the Republican side has not drawn as much attention from presidential aspirants.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee  Winsome Earle-Sears  last week for a fundraiser. New Jersey’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Ciattarelli has recently campaigned with Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor in Florida in 2026. Trump also held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli this month.\n \n\n   \n  Though New Jersey and Virginia have seen frequent visits from high-profile Democrats, the New York City mayoral race has not drawn as many national party figures to campaign on behalf of Mamdani, a democratic socialist.\n \n\n   \n  But  he has received a boost  from Ocasio-Cortez and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – both popular figures with the progressive base who are able to draw large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m talking to you, Donald Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez declared at a rally last weekend, saying that “we will work our hearts out to elect Zohran Kwame Mamdani as the next mayor of the great city of New York.”\n \n\n   \n  While each of these high-profile Democrats has taken a turn on the campaign stage, former President Barack Obama remains the party’s most sought-after surrogate. He’s taped ads for Sherrill and Spanberger and will campaign in-person for the two Democratic candidates in their states on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic party’s most recent leaders – former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden – have not appeared on this year’s campaign trail as Democrats still grapple with the fallout of last year’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Harris, who has left the door open to a possible run in 2028, sent a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Sherrill this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Again and again, Mikie has shown that she is not afraid of a tough fight, and that she will stand up to anyone who attacks the rights, freedoms, or livelihoods of the people she serves,” Harris wrote. “That is exactly the kind of leadership we need right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden has not made any campaign stops since leaving office but is scheduled to appear at a political event for the Nebraska Democratic Party three days after Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Biden was one of the Democratic Party’s most active surrogates for the midterm elections, stumping for candidates in places like Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. He launched his presidential campaign the following spring.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new crop of Democrats is trying to chart its own path to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the start, 2025,” said Leopold. “And you’re going to see a lot more of it in 2026.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-7-500-refugees-limit-white-south-africans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"Trump Sets 7,500 Annual Limit for Refugees Entering U.S. – Will Be Mostly White South Africans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has announced a drastic reduction in the annual number of refugees admitted into the United States, limiting the total to 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year—down from 125,000 under President Joe Biden.

CTE, too, study finds \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:18 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The neurologic disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE has most often been found in people who experienced repeated blows to the head while playing contact sports and there’s now  evidence  of genetic damage inside the brain, too.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers examined the brains of football players and others with the  rare neurological disease , and the genetic damage they found looks similar to what they see in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. The damage was so extensive that it was the equivalent of hundreds of years of aging.\n \n\n   \n  CTE typically develops years after someone has received repeated blows to the head. Symptoms can include memory loss, impulse control problems, anxiety, depression and anger issues. It’s most often seen in people who play sports like football, hockey and soccer, but it’s also been detected in the brains of soldiers who have been injured in explosions and in some people who experienced domestic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The disease was first identified nearly 100 years ago in boxers – at the time, scientists called it  “punch-drunk syndrome”  – but there’s still much that experts don’t know about CTE. Not everyone with repeated head trauma develops the condition, and scientists don’t totally understand why or even how head trauma can lead to this disease.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Chris Walsh, co-author of the  study published Thursday  in the journal Science, says there are still people who deny that CTE is even a disease. The latest research, he said, should change naysayers’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel like this study helps establish that CTE is something distinct from just repetitive head trauma. It represents a more gradually developing pathological process and is a well-defined entity,” said Walsh, who is chief of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children’s Hospital and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.” We suspect it involves immune activation in a way similar to Alzheimer’s disease.”\n \n\n   \n  At this point, scientists don’t have a simple blood test or scan that can detect CTE   in a living person. The only way to make  a definitive diagnosis  is to take thin slices of the brain after the person’s death and use a microscope to look for an abnormal accumulation of tau, a protein that stabilizes certain elements of the brain. Too much tau can damage blood vessels and brain cells, and this buildup is also a hallmark   of Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brain is made up of a mosaic of cells that each have their own genome. Every time a stem cell divides, it accumulates mutations. The new study used sequencing and amplification technology only recently made available to look at the genes of single cells in hundreds of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain used for decision-making and other thinking skills.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers compared the results from four groups: 15 people who had repeated hits to the brain and were diagnosed with CTE; four people who had repeated head injuries but hadn’t developed CTE; 19 people without a history of head injuries or signs of CTE; and seven people who had Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  Among the people with CTE, the cells showed genomic damage that looked similar to the brains of people who had Alzheimer’s. The people who had repeated brain trauma but were not diagnosed with CTE did not have the same kind of damage.\n \n\n   \n  “Cells carry a bar code of their whole developmental history, including reflecting environmental influences, and that’s what’s happening in CTE,” Walsh explained. “The abnormal environment created by the repeated trauma damages the genomes of the cells.”\n \n\n   \n  With better understanding of the mechanisms that cause CTE, Walsh hopes the work can eventually lead to developing treatments. Because brain damage with CTE looks similar to Alzheimers, it may even be possible to use therapies for CTE patients that helped people with Alzheimer’s, but much more research will be needed before that could happen.\n \n\n   \n  The new study builds on recent research indicating that brain damage from repeated blows to the head can show up much earlier than the excessive tau markers that are seen with CTE become clear.\n \n\n   \n  A  2023 study  showed that the brain’s immune cells were increasingly activated in proportion to the number of years an athlete played contact sports, suggesting that early cellular damage may be setting the stage for the disease to progress.\n \n\n   \n  A  2020 study  also found that the risk of CTE doubles for every 2.6 years spent playing football. The condition has been reported in people as young as 17, meaning by the time a football player goes pro, they have experienced hundreds of thousands of hits to the head, and that damage seems to be adding up.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL has implemented several rule and equipment changes to reduce the number of head injuries, and the number of concussions has declined, with data from the  2024 season  showing the lowest number of concussions since tracking began in 2015.   Other sports leagues including the NHL, MLS and the English Premier League have also made changes to reduce the number of concussions among their playeres.\n \n\n   \n  But experts say it’s not just concussions that are the problem; any hit to the head can cause damage. Some suggest that if children really want to play football, their parents might skip early leagues, which can start as early as age 5, and instead wait until children turn 14 or 18 to let them play tackle football. The American Youth Soccer Organization doesn’t recommend heading the ball before the age of 10, and coaches are not encouraged to teach or practice heading at early ages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:32:00Z","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, with Jamaica bearing the brunt as it made landfall as a Category 5 storm, causing extensive flooding, power outages, and the evacuation of over 140,000 people.

reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:32 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is now headed for Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, where it won’t make landfall but will bring quick-hitting bursts of strong winds and rain as soon as late Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Bermuda have closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting Bermuda’s main island with St. David’s Island – in preparation. All schools and ferries will also be shut on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding, left widespread power outages in its wake and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  At least 30 people are known to have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  The island of Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Hurricane Melissa made landfall there Tuesday at its strongest – as a  Category 5 storm  – with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  Alfred Hines, 77, who lives in Jamaica’s Montego Bay, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have yet to reach the worst-affected areas. So far, four bodies have been found in St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations, but the government has not provided a death toll since the hurricane battered the island on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the Jamaican capital, Kingston, on the eastern side of the island, are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated. In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help the people of Cuba recover from the hurricane.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has historically taken a hard-line stance against the Communist-ruled island. In June, President Donald Trump signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying , “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aim from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 23 deaths due to severe flooding and landslides. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.

 introduced last spring, with four Senate Republicans joining Democrats to object to the president’s trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  For a third time in as many days, Sens. Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell, the former GOP leader, crossed the aisle to advance the measure in a 51 to 47 vote. All four voted for separate resolutions earlier in the week targeting Trump’s tariffs on  Canada   and  Brazil .\n \n\n   \n  The resolutions seek to end the tariffs by terminating emergency declarations from the president.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the week’s tariff votes amount to symbolic rebukes of the president’s trade policy, as they aren’t expected to be taken up by the House. Earlier this year, House Republicans moved to block members from being able to force a vote in the near future on the president’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Paul was a co-sponsor of the resolution and McConnell pledged that he would vote for all three of the resolutions. “Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tim Kaine, one of the sponsors of this resolution, as well as the other two that passed earlier this week, said earlier in the week that the president’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was not appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m against tariffs generally, unless they’re used very specifically. But I’m also against letting presidents just invent a reason to use emergency powers to do all kinds of things without coming to Congress,” he told reporters Tuesday, comparing congressional oversight of the executive to a muscle that has to be exercised regularly.\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia Democrat has acknowledged the House will not take up his resolution, and that they don’t have a veto-proof majority backing the measure in the Senate. But he has insisted that adopting anti-tariff resolutions will still send a strong message to the president.\n \n\n   \n  “I did learn in the, in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/science/dueling-dinosaurs-fossil-nanotyrannus-tyrannosaurus-rex","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:03:00Z","title":"Dueling dinosaurs’ fossil forces a radical rethink of T. rex remains","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A groundbreaking study published in 2025 reevaluates the famous 'dueling dinosaurs' fossil at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, originally thought to show a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex locked in combat with a Triceratops.

The discovery has triggered a rethink of many other fossils previously identified as teenage T. rex remains, Napoli added.\n \n\n   \n  While similar in appearance, the two dinosaur species would have been very different: Nanotyrannus was 18 feet long, agile and built for speed, with long legs and strong arms to grasp prey, while 42-foot-long T. rex had stocky legs and used its devastating bite to devour huge, slow-moving dinos.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its relatively diminutive size, Napoli said that Nanotyrannus had larger upper limbs than a fully grown T. rex, which had famously tiny arms. “Bones don’t shrink when animals grow so this could not have possibly become an (adult) T. rex,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The finding “flips decades of T. rex research on its head,” according to study coauthor Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.\n \n\n   \n  “A wealth of studies on the biology of T. rex over the past three decades have unknowingly mixed data from Nanotyrannus with that of T. rex. Those studies need to be reevaluated in light of this discovery,” Zanno said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The dueling dinosaurs  fossil was first discovered 2006 , exposed as sedimentary rock eroded from the Hell Creek Formation, which dates back 65.5 million years and stretches across parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n    Mistaken identity\n \n\n   \n  Nanotyrannus lancensis, which like T. rex is part of the larger tyrannosaurid family in taxonomic classification, was first identified from a fossil unearthed in the 1940s from the same rock formation as the dueling dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  However, scientists later shifted the narrative and interpreted that initial find and many other small Tyrannosaur fossils uncovered in the following decades to be juvenile T. rex specimens. The idea that another species might have produced the fossils fell out of favor, though the possibility was still debated at scientific conferences and other forums.\n \n\n   \n  The new research, which examined and compared over 200 Tyrannosaur fossils, suggests that juvenile T. rex fossils were not as common in the fossil record as paleontologists previously thought. For years, the study authors reported, paleontologists have misidentified Nanotyrannus fossils as juvenile T. rex specimens and used the morphological features of the remains to  model T. rex growth and behavior .\n \n\n   \n  “What’s exciting is that this discovery opens the door to a whole series of new questions about how these different predators — one built for brute strength and one built for speed — interacted in the twilight of the dinosaurs,” Zanno said.\n \n\n   \n  The study authors said they also had identified a fossil called “Jane” as a  second species of Nanotyrannus , which they dubbed Nanotyrannus lethaeus. The name is a reference to the River Lethe, the river of forgetfulness in Greek mythology, a nod to how this dinosaur remained hidden in plain sight and “forgotten” for decades.\n \n\n   \n    Uncomfortable questions\n \n\n   \n  The finding raises “uncomfortable” questions about why a scientific consensus came together so quickly around the idea that all Nanotyrannus specimens are juvenile T. rexes, said Larry Witmer, Chang Ying-Chien Professor of Paleontology at Ohio University. Witmer didn’t take part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Many T. rex fossils, which can sell for  tens of millions of dollars at auction , were commercially collected and are in private hands, making them difficult to study, he noted in a commentary published alongside the research.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptionally researched study by Zanno and Napoli puts Nanotyrannus on a solid foundation,” Witmer said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the implications of the findings go beyond settling a scientific disagreement.\n \n\n   \n  “There is much more at stake here than declaring a victor in the debate, because there are literally decades of research and probably hundreds of publications based on a premise that this article overturns,” he said. “These analyses will all need revision.”\n \n\n   \n  Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh said the finding should prompt “a fundamental reassessment of tyrannosaur classification and evolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “For many years in my research on tyrannosaurs, I’ve considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as the famous skeletons of huge T. rexes to be juveniles of T. rex rather than a distinctive smaller species,” Brusatte, who wasn’t involved with the new study, explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Reading this new paper, I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong — at least in part,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  However, not every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton should be classified as Nanotyrannus, according to Brusatte. “T. rex was the size of a bus as an adult, and bones of adult T. rexes are very common across western North America, from Saskatchewan down to New Mexico,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of these must be juvenile T. rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult Nanotyrannus from teenage T. rex, as they were probably both very similar in size, and in their skeletal features,” he noted. “That will be the challenge for future paleontologists.”\n \n\n   \n  The evidence presented in the study that the smaller animal in the dueling dinosaurs fossil is in fact Nanotyrannus is “pretty conclusive,” according to Thomas Carr, a senior scientific advisor at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and an associate professor of biology at Carthage College. However, fresh fossils are needed to understand the differences between Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named species of Nanotyrannus lethaeus, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Carr also said he isn’t sure about whether the fossil “Jane” should be reclassified as Nanotyrannus lethaeus, as the new research suggests. “They’ve done strong work, but we must be cautious,” said Carr, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Napoli said dueling dinosaurs, which is still partially encased in rock, has many more secrets to spill. Scientists still don’t know how the two animals died — or why they were found entangled. But the Nanotyrannus specimen is 100% complete, which is extraordinarily rare in the fossil record, Napoli noted.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some bones that are partially broken with a piece missing, but every individual bone is represented to some degree,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers hope skin or feathers might also be preserved in the sediment surrounding the remains and that there are injuries on the specimen, such as a broken finger, they haven’t yet explored.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a tremendous amount of science to do on the dueling dinosaurs,” Napoli said. “It’s an amazing fossil to work on.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/federal-judge-blocks-asylum-application-fee","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge halts asylum application fee","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Maryland has temporarily blocked the enforcement of a new $100 annual asylum application fee mandated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, citing confusion and conflicting policies between the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).

Díaz\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:10 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday temporarily paused the government’s rollout of a new annual asylum application fee, citing confusion and inconsistent policies between federal agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Stephanie Gallagher said two agencies, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” by issuing conflicting guidance on how and when asylum seekers must pay the $100 annual fee created under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n \n\n   \n  Gallagher found that the lack of coordination between the two agencies had caused “significant confusion” and even led to some asylum seekers being ordered removed before any mechanism to pay the fee existed. She temporarily stayed both agencies’ policies, blocking enforcement of the annual fee nationwide, until they issue clear, uniform guidance.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants have not resolved the inconsistency between the two agencies’ policies,” Gallagher wrote, adding that the government’s conflicting rules created “irreparable harm” for asylum applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP) filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland accusing the government of unlawfully applying a new annual asylum fee to people who filed their cases before the law took effect.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed on July 4, asylum applicants are required to pay the $100 fee each year their case remains pending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous to the legislation, there was no fee required when applying for asylum.\n \n\n   \n  The US Citizenship and Immigration Services began sending notices of the new fee on October 1, giving applicants a 30-day window to pay the fee —meaning the fee will start being due as early as October 31.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP says the rollout has caused panic and confusion among asylum seekers. One member, a man from Russia who applied in 2022, told the group he’s been “very worried” because he hasn’t received any instructions from the government on how or when to pay, according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, some applicants do not have the financial means to pay the fee, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  “They would have to choose between feeding their families or paying the fee,” Susan Pelletier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said during Tuesday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit includes stories of people who say they’ve been impacted by the fees. A woman from Honduras says she fears she’ll face deportation over a fee she can’t afford and has no way to pay.\n \n\n   \n  Another asylum seeker from Nigeria says he only learned about the new rule from social media and worries missing a payment could jeopardize his case.\n \n\n   \n  In response to ASAP’s lawsuit, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, has established a payment portal that allows asylum seekers to pay the annual asylum fee.\n \n\n   \n  EOIR has also stated that it will provide notice to individuals who are subject to the new annual fee and credit any payments made through other existing systems.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP argues that USCIS and EOIR are retroactively applying the new annual asylum fee and providing contradictory information — and even set conflicting deadlines. In at least one case, the lawsuit says an immigration judge rejected an asylum application and ordered a removal for nonpayment, despite there being no mechanism to pay the fee at the time.\n \n\n   \n  During a hearing on Tuesday, Gallagher, an Obama appointee, pressed Department of Justice attorney Zareen Iqbal on whether the asylum application fee was being applied retroactively. Gallagher also noted that many applicants have already been waiting years for a decision on their cases.\n \n\n   \n  Iqbal responded that the policy was not being applied retroactively, explaining that it was intended to help address the high volume of asylum cases that have been pending for years. She compared the fee to a property tax — a recurring payment meant to sustain the system rather than penalize past applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department acknowledged that some applicants have faced difficulties following the announcement of the new fee. Iqbal told the court she would reach out to the plaintiffs and USCIS to help resolve the issue.\n \n\n   \n  The judge on Thursday said she would quickly entertain a motion to lift the stay on the fee once agencies enacted “uniform policies providing asylum applicants with fair notice of the applicable fee deadline, the mechanism for payment, and the adverse consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/david-drake-mfa-boston-tan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"MFA Boston Returns Works by Enslaved Artist David Drake to His Heirs","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston has made a historic and precedent-setting decision to return two 1857 pottery works by the enslaved Black potter David Drake to his descendants, marking the first time a U.S. museum has resolved ownership claims for art taken under conditions of slavery.

      \nUpdated: \n        1:01 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a very rare and likely precedent-setting agreement, the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston has agreed to return two works from 1857 by the Black potter David Drake, who made his ambitious jars while enslaved, to his present-day descendants.\n \n\n   \n  By the terms of the contract, one of those vessels will remain on loan to the museum for at least two years, according to the lawyer George Fatheree, who is representing Drake’s descendants. The other vessel — a masterpiece known as the “Poem Jar” — has been purchased back by the museum from the heirs for an undisclosed sum. Now the work comes with “a certificate of ethical ownership.”\n \n\n   \n  “In achieving this resolution, the MFA recognizes that Drake was deprived of his creations involuntarily and without compensation,” a museum spokesperson said in a statement. “This marks the first time that the museum has resolved an ownership claim for works of art that were wrongfully taken under the conditions of slavery in the 19th-century US.”\n \n\n   \n  Fatheree goes further, saying he believes their agreement “is groundbreaking in the art world.”\n \n\n   \n  “The application of principles of ethical restitution to artwork created by enslaved Americans, this is the first time that has ever occurred to my knowledge,” he said in a video call.\n \n\n   \n  Ethan Lasser, chair of the art of Americas at the MFA, said the museum has learned from its work restituting Nazi-looted art. “We’ve become very expert in Holocaust restitution. We’re dealing with (repatriation) issues in our African collections and Native American collections,” he said over the phone. “And we want to bring the same standard to the fullness of our collection.”\n \n\n   \n  He considers Drake’s work an example of “stolen property,” too, “since the artist is always the first owner of his work and he never got to make the call about where it went or what he was paid for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Born enslaved around 1800 in Edgefield, South Carolina, a region known for its rich clay, Drake (who was also known as Dave the Potter) was one of relatively few African American potters to sign his work. He also dared — despite punitive anti-literacy laws for enslaved people in the state — to etch short sayings or poems on the jars, making them powerful acts of resistance. Some inscriptions boast of the jar’s intended contents or enormous capacity; others remark more poignantly on his own life or working conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The “Poem Jar,” which the MFA originally bought in 1997 from a dealer in South Carolina, features a couplet that hints at Drake’s financial exploitation. The inscription reads: “I made this Jar = for cash/Though its called Lucre trash.” Currently in a gallery for self-taught and outsider art at the museum, it will assume a more prominent spot at the entrance of the Art of Americas wing once renovated in June 2026. (The jar that Drake’s family now owns has a signature and date but no writing.)\n \n\n   \n  Another jar made the same year, 1857, has a particularly wrenching inscription in light of Drake’s forced separation from a woman believed to be his wife and her two sons. That vessel, at the Greenville County Museum of Art in South Carolina, reads: “I wonder where is all my relation.”\n \n\n   \n  One of Drake’s great-great-great-great grandsons, the children’s book author and producer Yaba Baker, said he feels the restitution process offers one answer to that question. “It’s been exciting, overwhelming and feels full circle,” he said in a video call. He praised the MFA for “showing integrity and leadership” in “allowing us to connect to Dave’s legacy,” noting that “to go from being slaves to having a family of engineers and doctors and people in executive positions is a testament to Dave’s legacy in a different way.”\n \n\n   \n  These descendants began talking about getting involved in Drake’s legacy in 2022, upon the opening of “Hear Me Now: The Black Potters of Old Edgefield, South Carolina,” an exhibition jointly organized by the MFA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The family soon hired Fatheree, fresh from his win in the  Bruce’s Beach  land reparation case. Earlier this year they established the David Drake Legacy Trust, governed by five of the oldest heirs.\n \n\n   \n  So far there are about 15 family members involved, according to Fatheree, but they have created a website so that other descendants of Drake can be identified and join the efforts — what Fatheree calls “a big tent approach.”\n \n\n   \n  The initiative’s repercussions could be widespread. There are thought to be around 250  pots by Drake still in existence, and over the past five years the market for his work has exploded, driven mainly by American museums competing for pieces in the hopes of telling a more complex story about the history of slavery in the US. Several have paid six figures for his work, and in 2021 the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas paid a record-setting $1.56 million for a 25-gallon stoneware jar at auction.\n \n\n   \n  Other museums that own Drake’s work include the Met, the Philadelphia Art Museum, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, the Art Institute of Chicago, Harvard Art Museums, the St Louis Art Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, as well as smaller venues in the American South.\n \n\n   \n  Fatheree confirmed he has begun to reach out to some of these other art institutions on behalf of the family. “Our approach has been one of collaboration and invitation. I am not a litigator; we did not go to the museum and file a lawsuit (or) threaten to sue them. But our hope and frankly our expectation is that other institutions” — and private collectors of Drake’s work, he added — “will follow the Boston museum’s lead here.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not just an opportunity for museums to be on the right side of history,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for museums to rewrite history and think not just about ownership and stewardship, but think about stewardship and justice.”\n \n\n   \n   Read more stories from The Art Newspaper  here .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/israel-receives-remains-hostages-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:39:00-04:00","title":"Israel Receives Hostage Remains from Hamas Amid Ceasefire Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has received the remains of two deceased hostages from Hamas, transferred via the Red Cross, marking the 11th confirmed death of hostages in Gaza.

30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel has received the remains of what Hamas earlier said were two deceased hostages held in Gaza. The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and will be taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed, that would leave the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional development.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/economy/xi-trump-trade-deal-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-10:30","title":"A Trump-Xi trade deal won’t fix either country’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The recent trade agreement between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, while marking a diplomatic breakthrough, is unlikely to significantly improve either nation's economy.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:16 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The extraordinary trade war President Donald Trump unleashed has been taking a toll on the Chinese and American economies. China is in a far more precarious state, mostly due to preexisting problems, but  the new trade agreement  is unlikely to move the dial much for either of the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, the headlines coming out of the historic meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggest a big victory for both sides. The agreement calls for the United States to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay export controls on rare earths and increase purchases of American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures might alleviate some of the pain businesses and consumers have felt since Trump returned to office. However, it’s going to take a lot more to address the wounds that have been festering.\n \n\n   \n    Too little, too late?\n \n\n   \n  For one particular part of the American economy that’s been hurting the most from the resurgent trade war with China, the agreement may be coming too late.\n \n\n   \n  American soybean farmers  have been reeling  from China’s effective embargo on the commodity that began in May, when higher tariffs went into place. Up until this week, China hadn’t purchased any American soybeans, the top agricultural export for the US. China has historically been the largest export market for American soybeans, so the embargo has significantly depressed American soybean prices for the past few months.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Trump said China will buy “tremendous amounts” of soybeans, with  peak harvest season already in full swing , many US farmers may have already sold crop yields at lower prices.\n \n\n   \n    No quick fix in sight for the US job market\n \n\n   \n  Trump inherited a labor market that was already weakening, and the latest data shows that hiring  slowed to a crawl in recent months .\n \n\n   \n  His aggressive and unpredictable tariffs have only exacerbated that, as businesses have become hesitant to hire more workers due to uncertainty. Increasingly, US companies are now laying off workers, too. For the first time in years, there are more people unemployed than jobs available, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  Advances in artificial intelligence are also playing in to some layoffs, as highlighted by  Amazon’s massive job cuts  this week. And while rate cuts have traditionally been the Federal Reserve’s primary tool to support the labor market, central bankers say AI may already have caused systemic damage that can’t be fixed through monetary policy.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Christopher Waller noted in recent remarks that even over a longer horizon, “if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool.”\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, there are growing concerns that lower rates could do more harm than good, pushing up inflation at a time when goods and services are already  more expensive . Some of that inflation is attributable to higher tariffs, and some is from tighter immigration controls that have cut back on the supply of workers in areas like child care and farming.\n \n\n   \n    China’s cocktail of economic woes\n \n\n   \n  For China, while its exports have shown remarkable resilience this year in the face of Trump’s global tariff offensive, its longstanding domestic economic woes have persisted to the point where there are even fewer immediate benefits of a trade deal compared to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among the factors clouding China’s economic outlook are a prolonged property downturn, persisting deflation, dampened consumer confidence and high youth unemployment.\n \n\n   \n  “Beyond a cyclical impulse, it’s hard to see today’s revised trade terms as materially shifting China’s more structural challenges at home, where we think tariffs are, if anything, fading in macro relevance,” Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics, said in a note on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the fentanyl-related tariff reduction as part of the Thursday deal could at best add a “marginal” 0.2% upside to China’s growth forecast next year.\n \n\n   \n  Recent economic data from China continues to paint a gloomy picture. In September, the decline in China’s factory-gate prices, a gauge of deflation, extended into the 36th straight month, though the drop has narrowed following Beijing’s attempt in recent months to rein in price competition in certain sectors. China’s much-touted electric vehicle industry, for example, has been embroiled in a relentless race to the bottom, partly due to excess capacity.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not helping that consumer demand is on the decline, as evidenced by the pace of retail sales slowing to a 10-month low at 3% in September compared with a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the mix of challenges, China’s new home prices sank in September at their fastest pace in 11 months, despite traditionally being a peak season for property spending. The protracted slump, which  began with developers’ debt defaults in 2021 , is expected to continue weighing on consumer sentiment.\n \n\n   \n    Not a done deal\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump and Xi reached Thursday can merely be thought of as a rough draft — nothing has been signed. It’ll likely take several more meetings between American and Chinese counterparts to nail down a firmer agreement that eventually becomes a signed deal. Or it may not even get to that point at all.\n \n\n   \n  For now, though, both economies can take some solace in the fact that Trump’s threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese exports, which Beijing almost certainly would have retaliated against, is off the table.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/palestinian-american-teenager-remains-in-israeli-jail-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00-04:00","title":"Palestinian American teenager to remain in Israeli jail despite growing pressure in Congress for his release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Palm Bay, Florida, has been detained in Israeli prisons for over eight months without trial after being accused of throwing rocks at Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.

of massacring hundreds of people as videos emerge of atrocities and bodies in Sudanese city \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Vasco Cotovio, Nada Bashir, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:17 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-diary-ceo-interview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"Kamala Harris Opens Up About 'Complicated' Relationship With Biden, Including When He 'Greatly Disappointed' Her","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent podcast interview on 'The Diary of a CEO,' Kamala Harris revealed a 'complicated' relationship with former President Joe Biden, citing a frustrating phone call moments before her debate with Donald Trump.

Week 9 brings the return of Lamar Jackson, another Mahomes–Allen duel, and hopefully a few games that actually keep us on the edge of our seats. Here are five things to know about Week 9:\n \n\n   \n    Lamar’s finally back\n \n\n   \n  Let’s try this again. Baltimore Ravens quarterback  Lamar Jackson  is set to start Thursday night in Miami against the Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson practiced last week, and many expected him to suit up against the Chicago Bears, but the team opted to give his hamstring one more week to heal. Jackson now says he’s “100 percent healthy,” and the Ravens are banking on that being true.\n \n\n   \n  At 2-5, Baltimore is in dangerous territory – only two teams in NFL history have reached the postseason after starting 2-6. After their slow start, Jackson and the Ravens have almost no margin for error the rest of the way.\n \n\n   \n     Chiefs-Bills showdown \n \n\n   \n  No matchup in football has delivered more drama over the past five seasons than the  Kansas City Chiefs  vs. the Buffalo Bills. Sunday’s clash will mark the 10th meeting in six years between Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. It’s become must-see TV anytime these two square off and is undoubtably the league’s best quarterback rivalry.\n \n\n   \n  Allen owns a 4-1 record against Mahomes in the regular season, but Mahomes is undefeated where it counts – he’s 4-0 in the postseason. After a sluggish start, Kansas City’s offense is back in sync, averaging 30.8 points over its last five games, fourth best in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo’s defense dominated in last week’s 40-9 rout of the Carolina Panthers but suffered another setback,  losing Ed Oliver  to a torn bicep. Will we get another epic shootout? This latest installment of Mahomes vs. Allen headlines Sunday’s CBS slate, kicking off at 4:25 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n     Can we get a close game, please? \n \n\n   \n  Here’s hoping Chiefs-Bills gives us a thriller because  Week 8 was a snooze fest .\n \n\n   \n  It was the first NFL Sunday since 1970 with one or fewer games decided by single digits (with a minimum eight games). The lone nail-biter came in the New York Jets’ 39-38 comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n \n\n   \n  Week 9 features more big spreads, but in the NFL, these things tend to even out. Here’s to some games that actually go down to the wire.\n \n\n   \n     Don’t expect points in Houston \n \n\n   \n  If you like fireworks and 40-point shootouts, you might want to skip the Denver Broncos going to Houston to play the Texans.\n \n\n   \n  Both defenses are elite. Houston leads the NFL in yards allowed (266.9) and points allowed (14.7) per game. Denver, meanwhile, tops the league in sacks with 36. The over/under is set at just 39.5 – one of the lowest totals all season.\n \n\n   \n  The Texans, sitting at 3-4, can’t afford many more losses if they hope to chase down the 7-1 Colts in the AFC South.\n \n\n   \n     Kyler owns Arlington \n \n\n   \n  Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray is officially questionable for Monday night’s showdown with the Dallas Cowboys because of a foot sprain, but don’t expect him to sit this one out – AT&T Stadium is basically his personal playground.\n \n\n   \n  Murray has never lost there – 5-0 in high school at Allen High (with three state titles), 1-0 at Oklahoma (Big 12 Championship) and 2-0 as a pro against Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes are high again. At 2-5, the Cardinals are clinging to postseason hopes. Fall to 2-6, and those hopes all but disappear.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/milorad-dodik-sanctions-trump-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00-04:00","title":"US lifts sanctions on Putin-backed Bosnian Serb strongman after Trump allies’ lobbying","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on Milorad Dodik, a Bosnian Serb political leader long sanctioned for violating the Dayton Peace Agreement, after a sustained lobbying campaign by allies of Donald Trump.

lifts sanctions on Putin-backed Bosnian Serb strongman after Trump allies’ lobbying \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:04 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on a kleptocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was removed this month as president of the Serb territory within Bosnia and Herzegovina for chipping away at the US-brokered peace deal that ended bloody ethnic violence in the Balkans in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  The waiving of sanctions on  Milorad Dodik  followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.\n \n\n   \n  Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia’s integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”\n \n\n   \n  Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It’s setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King’s College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton’s 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration’s decision was especially dispiriting.\n \n\n   \n  The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in  July 2017  for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump’s return to the White House, Dodik’s overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich’s firm, signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.\n \n\n   \n  Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year’s work, plus a bonus if Zell’s firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act website. In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.\n \n\n   \n  This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik’s cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president,  said  Dodik’s removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”\n \n\n   \n  Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser,  called  for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”\n \n\n   \n  Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump’s one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump’s famous MAGA hats.\n \n\n   \n  Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00.000Z","title":"The ‘6-7’ meme can be annoying.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/nuclear-weapons-testing-trump-china-russia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00-04:00","title":"Trump Instructs Pentagon to Start Testing Nuclear Weapons on an Equal Basis with Russia and China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that the United States would begin testing nuclear weapons on an 'equal basis' with Russia and China, marking a dramatic reversal of the decades-long nuclear testing moratorium.

instructs Pentagon to start testing nuclear weapons ‘on an equal basis’ with Russia and China \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, Brad Lendon, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:35 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to begin testing US nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Russia and China, heralding a potentially major shift in decades of US policy at a time of growing tensions between the world’s nuclear-armed superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made the announcement moments before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, for what had been billed as make-or-break talks intended to restore stability after almost a year of trade and economic turmoil.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on social media Trump said, “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China as “a distant third” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or  a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system . Not since the 1990s has one of the world’s three major military powers conducted a nuclear weapons test, with China having conducted its last known test in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, when it began a voluntary moratorium on such explosive testing. It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.\n \n\n   \n  Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal,  according to  the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  “There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.\n \n\n   \n  “All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.\n \n\n   \n  China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years,  according to the Federation of American Scientists , and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  At  a military parade  in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”\n \n\n   \n  “They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”\n \n\n   \n  The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.\n \n\n   \n    A new arms race?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.\n \n\n   \n  But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.\n \n\n   \n  “If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.\n \n\n   \n  There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing.  CNN reported in 2023  that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/andrew-cuomo-mamdani-nyc-mayor-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:53:00-04:00","title":"In his last stand, Andrew Cuomo zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final stretch of the 2025 New York City mayoral race, Andrew Cuomo relaunched his campaign after a primary loss, leveraging his 11-year governorship and experience to counter Zohran Mamdani, a progressive challenger with strong social media appeal and a democratic socialist platform.

zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 18%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/dutch-election-poll-d66-party-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:08:00-04:00","title":"Dutch Centrist Jetten Confident of Forming Government After Far Right’s Election Setback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the Dutch parliamentary elections of October 29, 2025, centrist leader Rob Jetten of the D66 party expressed confidence in forming a government, despite a tie with the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) on 26 seats each.

D66 tripled its score.\n \n\n   \n   Major mainstream parties  have ruled out governing with Wilders this time after he brought down the last coalition, which was led by his own party.

We will do everything we can to prevent that,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Counting of ballots was still under way, but with 98.8% of votes accounted for it was not expected to change the fact that the two biggest parties are tied for the top spot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/shutdown-snap-trump-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-04:00","title":"Trump returns to confront deepening duel of pain as shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump returns from an Asia tour just as a month-long government shutdown reaches its most severe phase, deepening the domestic political crisis of his second term.

  9:30 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump had his fun, with red carpet welcomes, impromptu dances, the  gift of a golden crown  and a yet another  Nobel Peace Prize nomination .\n \n\n   \n  But the trophies from  his Asia tour  won’t count for much when he arrives home Thursday just as the monthlong government shutdown takes its bitterest turn yet amid the worst domestic political crisis of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  His return and a confluence of suddenly harsher  consequences for millions of Americans  mean the next few days may represent the only way out of the increasingly damaging impasse before the run-up to Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pretending that everything is OK,” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/white-house-ballroom-east-wing-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:03:00-04:00","title":"The White House ballroom saga could be worse for Trump than he realizes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s decision to demolish the East Wing of the White House and replace it with a 90,000-square-foot privately funded ballroom has sparked significant public disapproval, with both the Yahoo News-YouGov and Washington Post-ABC News polls showing a 2-to-1 margin of opposition.

And the White House kind of needed a ballroom!\n \n\n   \n  “Of all the reasons to criticize President Trump, this must count as the silliest,” the often-Trump-skeptical  National Review wrote .\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “ a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere .”\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump’s handling of the East Wing and the ballroom.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he’s done in this second term. And it’s not just those  who dislike Trump that are objecting.\n \n\n   \n  New  Yahoo News-YouGov  and  Washington Post-ABC News  polls are the first quality surveys to dig into the ballroom saga in depth. And both show similar things.\n \n\n   \n  The former shows Americans disapproved of Trump’s demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.\n \n\n   \n  The latter shows Americans also oppose the broader project by a 2-to-1 margin, 56%-28%.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump’s supporters aren’t defending him too hard.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, just 55% of Republicans in the Yahoo poll approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That’s compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.\n \n\n   \n  In both polls, the percentage strongly opposed to the project far outpaced the percentage strongly in favor – 46%-18% in the Yahoo poll and 45%-15% in the Post-ABC poll. In both surveys, about half of independents strongly opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  So this  does  appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.\n \n\n   \n  None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump’s overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they’re seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.\n \n\n   \n  An important question from there is why people disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  Is it just because they don’t really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “ won’t interfere with the current building ,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)\n \n\n   \n  All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.\n \n\n   \n  While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely in the Yahoo poll to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).\n \n\n   \n  That’s a little counter intuitive.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don’t like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.\n \n\n   \n  What that might suggest: People don’t really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He’s  gilded the interior of the White House . He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they’ve ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts  like a golden crown from South Korea .\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this. A  Pew Research Center poll  conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family.\n \n\n   \n  A  CBS News-YouGov poll  around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn’t focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it doesn’t seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that’s exactly what he was doing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/lukoil-to-sell-foreign-assets-gunvor-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:44:00-04:00","title":"Crushed by punishing US sanctions, Russia’s Lukoil accepts offer to sell its international business","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, has accepted an offer from global commodity trader Gunvor to sell its international assets—including a major stake in Iraq’s West Qurna 2 oil field, key refineries in Bulgaria and Romania, and fuel supply operations in Europe—due to punishing U.S. sanctions imposed over Russia’s war in Ukraine.

The Canadian rapper and actor’s claim was that the label participated in defaming him by publishing and promoting the song.\n \n\n   \n  Lamar was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, and it  was recently dismissed by a federal judge.

The reduction will bring the minimum tariff on Chinese imports down to 20%, and the average tariff rate will fall to around 47%. That’s lofty compared to many other US trading partners but still more in line with the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  It could give some relief to US consumers, and it means Chinese goods can shed the outcast status in the United States that Trump’s high tariffs had imposed on them.\n \n\n   \n  But the tariff reduction is also a significant gamble for the Trump administration, which has encountered a persistent problem in its unprecedented trade war with China: ﻿Trump has been  bested by Xi in the trade war  at every turn. Even the fact that they met in person Thursday means Trump has already given into China’s demands. And, as history has proven in these on-again, off-again deals, it’s not clear the United States will get anything serious back by giving in on fentanyl tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Trump risks further eroding America’s relationship with its key allies while gaining a friendlier relationship with its chief economic adversary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is betting this time will be different. History suggests otherwise.\n \n\n   \n    China’s successful fight against Trump\n \n\n   \n  Trump wanted  four main outcomes  from his  tariffs on China : A reduction in fentanyl coming into the United States, a return of manufacturing to the United States, restoration of the balance of trade and a sale of TikTok’s US assets.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has made real progress on all four: China has pointed to strong actions it has taken toward preventing the export of the foundational chemicals used to make fentanyl. Dozens of companies have promised multibillion-dollar investments in US manufacturing. The US-China trade gap hit a 21-year low in August. And Trump and Xi agreed to the framework of a TikTok deal.\n \n\n   \n  But the frosty relationship has also caused major problems for the United States. China has restricted the export of  rare-earth minerals  – crucial elements in electronics and military equipment. It has refused to buy US soybeans, devastating American farmers. And it has made life more difficult for some key US businesses by launching antitrust investigations. China also has put in place hefty tariffs of its own on US imports.\n \n\n   \n  Despite several rounds of talks with US trade negotiators, China has continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration. Rare earths, in particular, became a key sticking point, and earlier guarantees of a free-flowing rare-earth market never materialized. Beijing has even tightened its controls by expanding its restrictions earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Under Thursday’s deal, China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, TikTok’s future in the US remains uncertain after rounds of trade talks between the two countries. Beijing stopped short of confirming a final deal on TikTok has been reached following the Xi-Trump meeting, pledging only to work with the US to “properly address” the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently acknowledged that China often fails to hold up its end of the bargain – including when he  announced in November  2024 that he would raise tariffs on China because of the fentanyl crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social several weeks after Election Day. Then President-elect Trump claimed that Chinese officials promised him the country would execute drug dealers caught funneling drugs into the United States but “never followed through.”\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump is making a deal\n \n\n   \n  So why would Trump make a deal with China on fentanyl now if Xi keeps reneging?\n \n\n   \n  First, China has taken honest-to-goodness action on fentanyl. For example, the country over the summer added two more elements used to make fentanyl to its list of controlled substances. When criminal networks adapted and began selling those elements on the black market, China worked to thwart those exports, too.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Thursday cited China’s  “ very strong action ”  in cracking down on fentanyl as a reason for lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  It appears that some  progress has been made on reducing fentanyl  emanating from China in recent years – and there’s some limited evidence that China’s actions are making an impact since Trump’s tariffs went into effect. The US Drug Enforcement Agency in an  annual report  released in May said fentanyl purity declined throughout 2024, consistent with indications that fentanyl cooks in Mexico were having trouble obtaining key precursor chemicals. US Customs and Border Protection have also  reported  that fentanyl stopped at the border was down in 2024 and is on pace to fall again in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may or may not agree that China has made progress on fentanyl, but he sounded a different note on the subject this week than he has sung in the past. He claimed Wednesday that “China is going to be working with me” on restricting the drug.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that they’re going to help us with the fentanyl situation,” Trump said. “They’re going to be doing what they can do.”\n \n\n   \n  Second, China holds significant leverage over the United States. Trump’s tariffs have backfired in numerous ways, including by angering US farmers – a key voting bloc – and creating a rare-earth shortage. China has also refused to fully open up their market to American AI chips, a major Trump goal to help cement US dominance in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs remain one key lever that Trump can pull, even as China has found markets outside the United States willing to buy its goods, blunting the damage Trump’s levies have imposed.\n \n\n   \n  Still, reducing tariffs represents one key Chinese demand. Trump’s meeting with Xi was another.\n \n\n   \n  Giving up some of that ground – particularly if China has shown some goodwill on fentanyl – gives Trump some ability to get what he wants out of these negotiations. In a vague statement on Thursday, China said it will make “corresponding adjustments” to its countermeasures on fentanyl-related tariffs after Trump agreed to cut the levies by half.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  A potential problem for the United States: The other two countries on which the Trump administration has imposed fentanyl tariffs – Mexico and Canada – probably watched Thursday’s announcement with a raised eyebrow and some raised blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries have also made real efforts to restrict fentanyl coming over the US border. And fentanyl coming in from Canada has never posed a major problem, making up less than 1% of overall fentanyl coming into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, Trump has threatened to raise  Mexico’s  and  Canada’s tariffs  while he is reducing tariffs on China. The deal could improve America’s relationship with its chief economic adversary while angering key allies and its two biggest trading partners.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the reduction in tariffs could help Americans who are paying the price. Albeit slowly, tariffs have raised prices in the United States. Any reduction will be welcome news for inflation-wary consumers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Liu and Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/asia/us-china-trump-xi-meet-south-korea-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:49:00-04:00","title":"Trump says rare earths deal and tariff cut agreed with China after high-stakes talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark meeting in South Korea, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a major trade deal that includes a one-year suspension of export controls on rare earth minerals and a 10% reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for China cracking down on fentanyl trafficking and increasing purchases of American soybeans.

with China after high-stakes talks \n       \n  By Betsy Klein and Simone McCarthy\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A landmark meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on  the sidelines of an international summit  in South Korea Thursday appears to have made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.\n \n\n   \n  “Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.\n \n\n   \n  The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls  on rare earth minerals , in exchange for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.\n \n\n   \n  In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.\n \n\n   \n  Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.\n \n\n   \n  One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.\n \n\n   \n  The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.\n \n\n   \n  In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.\n \n\n   \n    Troubled trade\n \n\n   \n  The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.\n \n\n   \n  At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-sports-business-cosm","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"NBA and Cosm Extend Partnership to Air Live Games in Domes Through 2030","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NBA and Cosm, a tech-driven start-up redefining the sports bar experience through immersive dome screens, have extended their partnership through 2030.

Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the sports world’s most intriguing start-up companies is renewing its long-term partnership with its first-ever major  professional sports league  partner.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA  and Cosm, the entertainment company that’s reinventing the sports bar with what they like to call “shared reality,” announced Thursday an extended partnership to air live NBA games in Cosm’s domes. The IMAX-esque experience allows Cosm’s customers to watch live sporting events on its unique 87-foot-diameter, 12L+ LED screens that have gone viral for offering a first-of-its-kind experience for fans.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA was Cosm’s first-ever league partner long before the company opened its first location in Los Angeles in 2024. The two entities are now set to work together into 2030 and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  “Our ambition is to give another option for fans that might be out of the marketplace or their favorite team is on the road, or they haven’t been able to get to those courtside seats or lower bowl seats,” said Jeb Terry, Cosm’s president and CEO, in an interview with  CNN Sports . “So, it’s really complementary, I would say, to the NBA’s ambition of opening up access, giving fans more ways to celebrate the game, and providing other opportunities to lean into that action.\n \n\n   \n  “And that’s why it was really an obvious opportunity from the beginning. Because not only is that the innovative spirit of the league, the tech-forward approach, but the same way we approach it by leveraging technology to augment that fan experience and give more optionality, so fans can just lean in and celebrate wherever they are, whether they’re in-market, out-of-market, wherever that may be.”\n \n\n   \n  The extended partnership will allow Cosm to produce and distribute live NBA games at Cosm’s venues for at least the next five years. That means Cosm will be able to send its in-house production team, which is responsible for the unique views provided to viewers at their domes, to key national TV games, events from next year’s  All-Star Weekend , the  playoffs  and  NBA Finals .\n \n\n   \n  Teddy Kaplan, NBA vice president and head of new media partnerships at the league, said working with Cosm has been a no-brainer for his team from the start.\n \n\n   \n  Kaplan was on a ski trip to Park City, Utah, in 2022 when he got the opportunity to visit Cosm’s headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. He diverted from that vacation for a bit to see what the company was working on and was introduced to Cosm’s experience center for the first time, which gave him an idea of what the finished domes would be like.\n \n\n   \n  He left that meeting wowed.\n \n\n   \n  “I got there and I said, ‘Oh my God, this is, this is the future. This is what we need,’” Kaplan told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Our fans are young, tech-savvy, diverse, and they push us to be innovative. And as you’ll see, across our portfolio of distribution points, we’re always looking for ways to innovate the way fans watch our game, whether it’s alt streams, whether it’s via virtual reality, whether it’s with our social partners. Cosm is the perfect piece in our broader network here.”\n \n\n   \n  The initial partnership with the NBA, agreed to in February 2023, was an important inflection point in the company’s history, according to Terry.\n \n\n   \n  That kind of high-profile partner gave Cosm – at that point about a year-and-a-half from opening its first location near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – much needed legitimacy as it entered into discussions with other leagues and broadcast companies that hold the rights to sporting events aired in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re building companies, there’s always these pivotal moments along the way. You get the technology sorted. You’re like, ‘OK, it works.’ Then you have to work on getting market adoption, and there’s a lot of ways to do that with our business,” Terry said.\n \n\n   \n  “Partnerships are paramount. They are critical to how we bring this to life with our fans. And so, having the NBA as our first, it was a great moment for our company to announce it … and then get that word of mouth trending within the industry and then pushing that forward. And so, you look to have all these credible moments along the way in this growth phase. And this was one of the big ones.”\n \n\n   \n  The next move for Cosm is scaling up into more locations. It currently has domes open at that initial location in Inglewood and one in Dallas. Three more locations have been announced in Detroit, Cleveland and Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  That puts the company in five NBA cities and looking to expand to more, including overseas locations that could put international fans closer to professional American basketball in a way that’s much cheaper and easier than flying across an ocean to get into an NBA arena.\n \n\n   \n  Given that Cosm is able to show its customers views that they would have to pay dearly to afford – the courtside view from the scorer’s table, underneath the hoops in the front row at either end of the floor – all from the comfort of a sports bar environment, Kaplan said the hope is that NBA fans will be able to approximate that experience from the domes.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to use the stat that 99% of our fans will never make it to an NBA game, and that’s in the US. When you go global, it’s 99.99%. And when you think about sitting courtside, basically 100%, right?” Kaplan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so having Cosm as a tool to bring fans closer to the game and speak to those tech-savvy fans is really perfect for us.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/americas/hurricane-melissa-damage-jamaica-cuba-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:39:00-04:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa Leaves a Trail of Devastation After Tearing Through the Caribbean","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in over 150 years, rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane, causing catastrophic damage across the Caribbean.

At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  with four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica’s government “is not in a position to make an official statement on deaths” that may have been caused by Hurricane Melissa, a government minister said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations, but the government has not provided a death toll since the hurricane battered the island on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Holness  declared  the country a disaster area   Tuesday, as he sought to deter price gouging.\n \n\n   \n  “We must… continue to proactively maintain stability, protect consumers, and prevent any exploitation at a time when citizens are securing food, water, and supplies,” Holness said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 77% of the country was  left  without electricity after Melissa crossed, a spokesperson said. The country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the already  beleaguered  country of Haiti, 23 people have died and 13 are missing, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Twenty of the deaths, including 10 children, happened when a flooded river in Petit-Goâve burst its banks, the agency said, revising an earlier death toll of 25 reported by the mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said Hurricane Melissa had wrought “significant” damage on the island.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been a highly complex night, with significant damage reported,” Díaz-Canel wrote on X. “I urge our people to remain vigilant, to uphold discipline, and to continue taking all necessary precautions.”\n \n\n   \n    Recovery efforts\n \n\n   \n  Several international efforts have already been launched to aid in the recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday authorized “an immediate US response” to mobilize support for affected communities in the Caribbean, according to a  statement  released by the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “deployed a regional Disaster Assistance Response Team, including urban search-and-rescue teams, to assess needs and provide search and recovery assistance,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jamaican government launched an  official website  for relief and recovery efforts, where users can access updates on flooding locations or blocked roads and locate shelters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/rare-earth-minerals-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-04:00","title":"What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump’s trade deal with China?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S.-China trade deal signed in October 2025 resolves a long-standing dispute over rare earth minerals, which are essential to modern technology and defense systems.

Beijing even  tightened earlier this month  its controls by massively expanding its restrictions..\n \n\n   \n  Under  Thursday’s deal , China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China  for years  has built up near-total control of the   minerals   as part of its wider  industrial policy .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about rare earths.\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths, and are they actually ‘rare?’\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths include   17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.\n \n\n   \n  The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are   also  environmentally damaging .\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths used for?\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research  note  from CSIS.\n \n\n   \n    Where do rare earths come from?\n \n\n   \n  Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls  92%  of the global output in the processing stage.\n \n\n   \n  There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.\n \n\n   \n    Why do rare earths matter in the trade war?\n \n\n   \n  Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions were a major topic of conversation when Xi and Trump met Thursday at the APEC summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, China  added five rare-earth elements  – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12.   China also required licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that  China violated a trade truce  as   Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.\n \n\n   \n  The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a  US Geological Survey report .\n \n\n   \n  But China’s latest restrictions were seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nectar Gan, John Liu, Donald Judd, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly and David Goldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/boxing-mayweather-pacquiao-rematch-negotiations-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00.000Z","title":"Blockbuster rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao ‘almost’ agreed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A potential rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao is reportedly 'almost' agreed upon, with both camps in negotiations.

\n       \n  By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There are no saints in the aftermath of a complicated breakup, and in one of the visuals accompanying Lily Allen’s latest album, “West End Girl” — interpreted as a post-mortem on her marriage to actor David Harbour — she assumes the role of the wayward nun, donning the familiar black and white habit to take a smoke break.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise album, which Allen released last Friday, can be taken as a play-by-play of the downfall of her five-year marriage, which began with Las Vegas nuptials in September 2020 after the couple met on celebrity dating app Raya. Though Allen did  tell Vogue  the album is only “inspired” by the relationship and not “all gospel.”\n \n\n   \n  Since its release, listeners have been piecing together a bigger picture of their relationship and its fallout, referencing the lyrics with years of reports and rumors. Also in the crossfire: the couple’s divisive  Architectural Digest feature  in early 2023, featuring their eclectic Brooklyn townhouse, which is now being retrospectively eyed as a warning sign. (“Perhaps The David Harbour-Lily Allen Home Is Worth Wrecking,” pop culture critic Hunter Harris  penned  as a Substack headline at the time.)\n \n\n   \n  Blessedly, the album visuals are striking not in their maximalism, but their quieter reverie. Throughout the images, Allen unsettles Catholic iconography: In one looped video, she clasps her hands in prayer, wearing the blue and red of Mother Mary; on the album’s cover, painter Nieves González  depicts  the singer as an updated Baroque icon, stoic in polka dots and chiaroscuro lighting.\n \n\n   \n  In the video loop of Allen as a nun, she crosses a leg to reveal sheer tights and black pumps as she smokes a cigarette. She seems to be grappling with the duality of desire — something she candidly sings to in the song “Sleepwalking” (“I know you’ve made me your Madonna / I wanna be your wh**e”). But the visual metaphor resonates across the album at large. Allen doesn’t depict herself as the virtuous, scorned wife, but a real and raw person who cycles through anxiety and insecurity until everything reaches its bitter end.\n \n\n   \n  Nun imagery has often been deployed in music, art and fashion to symbolize a reverence that is readily subverted, by sex, sin or feminism. Lady Gaga has worn the habit in music videos and on tour, while designers including Rick Owens have frequently played with the cloth caps’ austere form. And though Allen’s version of a nun is certainly no stranger to vice, she is perhaps most subverted by a lack of faith in herself, as she painfully recounts going against her better judgement again and again.\n \n\n   \n  “Listen, I am in a period of self-discovery at the moment and I’m really trying to explore how I’ve got myself into certain situations in the past,” she told Vogue. “I need to unpack some things and break some patterns and probably talk to my therapist about my relationship with my dad.”\n \n\n   \n  Online, some commentators have already dubbed the upcoming months “West End Girl Winter,” as Allen ushers in a period of self-reflection, leaving 2024’s “ Brat summer ” far in the rearview mirror. The key items for this new season are yet to be determined, but will presumably include a posh home, smudged eyeliner, revenge heels and an incisive pen. The full nun’s habit remains optional.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/chess-danny-rensch-profile-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00-04:00","title":"From being raised in 'the Collective' to being a 'shepherd' of chess: the winding journey of Danny Rensch","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Danny Rensch, once raised in a cult-like group known as the Church of Immortal Consciousness, overcame severe emotional, psychological, and physical trauma—including parental separation, substance abuse, and tinnitus—to become a leading figure in the global chess community.

Rensch \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:05 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Danny Rensch is at the vanguard of chess.\n \n\n   \n  He, alongside a few others, has helped to develop the sport from one which was played by the elites to a phenomenon that has exploded in recent years, particularly thanks to the rising popularity of online chess.\n \n\n   \n  But to get to where he is now – a self-described “shepherd” for chess in his role as chief chess officer at Chess.com – Rensch has been on quite the life path.\n \n\n   \n  As he describes in his new memoir, “Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life,” Rensch was raised in Arizona in what he describes as a cult, a group that he says orchestrated a separation from his own mother and exploited his proficiency at playing chess for its own reputational gain.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch had to overcome many hurdles: Surviving emotional and substance abuse, developing tinnitus and allegedly being manipulated by a charismatic leader by being told he’d be the savior of chess. But along the way, his journey has taken him from a small commune to becoming a guiding light in a sport which, he believes, still has plenty of opportunity to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the hardship and trauma he’s dealt with over his life, Rensch says he doesn’t hold any resentment. He believes the struggles of his past are all part of life’s rich tapestry, highlighting a quote from influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as the motto he lives by: “We are not what happens to us, we are what we choose to become.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we can learn through pain and suffering sadly, but also it can give us an appreciation for what we have,” Rensch told CNN Sports. “Part of my journey is that what grief has taught me is that your relationships are what matter the most and connecting with other people through whatever you’re doing is what actually gives you purpose.\n \n\n   \n  “Your purpose is not anything you do. It is what you feel and what you find within why you do it. And I adhere myself to the fact that I am not what has happened to me. I am what I’ve chosen to become. And I try to take that into everything that I do and everything that we do at Chess.com.”\n \n\n   \n    Life in the ‘Collective’\n \n\n   \n  Growing up, Rensch recalls in his memoir that he was afforded the freedom to run around with children his own age, spending days in the woods with his friends or splashing around in the water.\n \n\n   \n  That was initially what life was like inside the now-disbanded Church of Immortal Consciousness.\n \n\n   \n  According to the group’s beliefs, the Church of Immortal Consciousness followed the teachings of Dr. Pahlvon Duran, a figure who last lived in the 15th century. Rensch describes the group as a spiritual haven for those looking for direction. Known internally as the Collective, the group sought to give lost souls direction – or as they called it, a Purpose – in a supposedly egalitarian society.\n \n\n   \n  Run by Steven and Trina Kamp, the Collective would meet to ensure members focused on their spiritual alignment and, as a group, would pool their money together to ensure they were financially merged.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch recalls they would organize meetings – called Processes – where the members of the Collective would discuss whether or not a fellow member was following the teachings of Duran and, therefore, if they were spiritually pure. Rensch says in his memoir that these meetings often descended into loud arguments due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, and it would not be uncommon for someone to be “glassed” by having a full cup of liquid thrown in their face.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Kamp has previously denied the Church of Immortal Consciousness was a cult.\n \n\n   \n  Families would share accommodations, with Rensch recalling sharing beds with other kids across multiple abodes. But as a child, this was just something he was used to at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Many traveled to the Collective in search of meaning. But, as Rensch came to find out, life in an idealistic commune often doesn’t end in spiritual happiness.\n \n\n   \n  Despite preaching an equal society, it became apparent to Rensch that that wasn’t the case. He references a famous George Orwell quote from the classic novella Animal Farm when describing the hierarchy inside the Collective: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.”\n \n\n   \n  “There were leaders and there was a literal hierarchy, a totem pole system. In some ways, the members self-ranked and sort of self-flagellated in order to keep everything in check,” Rensch explained to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health professional and one of the leading experts on cults, told CNN Sports that these kinds of groups can cause a “dissociative disorder and a disruption of identity” in members.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan has personal experience having been a former member of the  Unification Church , the controversial religion founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and accused by critics of being a cult.\n \n\n   \n  “So in my case, I went from Steven Hassan of Flushing Queens, youngest of three kids, nice Jewish boy, wasn’t political, to a right-wing fascist wanting to take over the world,” Hassan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so I had a pseudo-identity in the image of the cult. So my own critical thinking was pushed down. It wasn’t erased, but it was pushed down. The public has this incorrect assumption that people who get into cults are weak or stupid or uneducated, and it’s just not true. In Danny’s case, he had no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  As a child, the social dynamics of the group didn’t register with Rensch. But in hindsight, he is now able to recognize the pitfalls of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch says in his book that the Kamps were able to weaponize the faith the Collective preached in an attempt to alter people’s life courses for the gain of the individual and the group. Whether it be how they raised their children or the job they were doing, the Kamps could decide whether it was the right fit spiritually and, if not, take steps to adjust.\n \n\n   \n  Also, in the search of spiritual happiness, it was commonplace for families to undergo dramatic changes. Husbands would leave their wives in search of their “Like Vibration” – a better fitting partner in the eyes of the Collective – and Rensch says children would be separated from their parents and adopted into other families to allow the child to flourish.\n \n\n   \n    Separation\n \n\n   \n  Rensch was an ordinary kid who liked ordinary activities. But his whole life changed upon watching the film “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”\n \n\n   \n  He was immediately gripped by a sport which was so different to any other, one which tested the brain in completely different ways than any other.\n \n\n   \n  And, as it turned out, Rensch was good at it from the outset. He would spend hours playing and teaching himself until his skills eventually caught the eye of church leader Steven Kamp.\n \n\n   \n  Kamp, a chess fan himself, saw the potential in Rensch’s game. Rensch said he later came to realize that Kamp saw Rensch’s ability at chess as a way of legitimizing the teachings of the Collective and justify the way the group worked.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Sports has attempted to contact Kamp to offer him the chance to comment.\n \n\n   \n  According to Rensch, Kamp took it upon himself to make sure that the boy received special chess training – including hiring the former Soviet defector, Igor Ivanov – and providing funds and transport so Rensch could travel to tournaments around Arizona and the country to test his skills. More than that, Kamp instructed Rensch that chess had become his Purpose, therefore instilling a religious importance to a game he was in his formative stages in learning.\n \n\n   \n  This added pressure on chess distorted his view on what was meant to be an enjoyable game, Rensch says.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was receiving discipline, to say it was wrapped up in shame and self-worth doesn’t even do it justice because the shame and self-worth was meant to transcend this lifetime. It was meant to transcend the planet,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like: ‘Oh, I’m actually, literally going to hell if I’m not putting my efforts into getting as good as I can at chess all the time.’”\n \n\n   \n  This added attention and time to focus on chess meant Rensch quickly went from promising youngster to tournament winner and chess prodigy. Over his chess career, he would become the youngest national chess master in Arizona history and a multi-time national scholastic champion.\n \n\n   \n  But this success came with a catch: Kamp took it upon himself to push Rensch further and further into the chess world, no matter the consequences, Rensch says. He saw Rensch as a future grandmaster.\n \n\n   \n  The constant flights and elevation changes involved in the journeys he was making across the US resulted in Rensch developing tinnitus, he said, which would eventually develop into chronic pain, infections and sinus pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch describes the most painful moment of his time with the group as being when he was separated from his mother, with his future success at chess given as a main reason why that move was orchestrated.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan said that children being separated from their parents is commonplace in cults, saying “parent alienation” is a typical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “This is something that typically happens with authoritarian cults. One of the parents gets into a cult, the other one doesn’t want to,” Hassan said. “So I’ve seen that one for 48 years. Every single cult does that as a thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rensch’s chess playing career would eventually fizzle out, and looking back in hindsight, his relationship with the sport changed as he grew up and could recognize the environment he was living in.\n \n\n   \n  “The game gave me everything and then it took everything away. And I’ve been to hell and back with chess so many times,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Moving on\n \n\n   \n  As Rensch went through his life in the Collective and his chess playing faded away, his issues continued to pile up.\n \n\n   \n  While he met his wife Shauna and had children of his own, Rensch says he dealt with alcohol and substance abuse as he struggled with the dynamic of the Collective and how he fit in. Shauna was briefly with the Collective when she was six but moved away before returning later in life.\n \n\n   \n  He recalls the moment he decided to leave the Collective shortly after the birth of his second child and coming to the painful realization that it was time to move on.\n \n\n   \n  That decoupling wasn’t an easy thought to process for Rensch, having spent most of his life with the group.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever I could do to myself, whatever baggage I was willing to carry, as long as it was just me, there was probably a part of me that could or would do it forever,” he said. “And that’s part of how you dip in and out of addictive behavior and back out again, you dip in and out of almost ruining your marriage but then barely saving it.”\n \n\n   \n    Stewards\n \n\n   \n  By that point, in 2009, Rensch had begun coaching on Chess.com. It was a humble beginning, but it allowed him to get his foot in the door at an organization which would soon enjoy a meteoric rise.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t easy at the beginning. The website was set up in 2007 and, at that time, the main online chess platform was the Internet Chess Club (ICC).\n \n\n   \n  Through years of development and clever marketing, Chess.com was able to develop into the dominant force of internet chess, with Rensch playing a key role behind that growth.\n \n\n   \n  As well as making it the main platform for coaches to help nurture the next generation of chess stars, a key manta in developing Chess.com was to open the sport to the wider community, with Rensch admitting that the game has at times been a “gatekeep community” by the “intellectually elite or (those who) want to revere and worship the intellectually elite.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were like: ‘This is wrong.’ And I saw that it was wrong from having failed to try to reach the mountain as a prodigy and (Chess.com CEO and co-founder) Erik (Allebest) saw that it was wrong as someone who always loved the game but felt kept out of the club,” Rensch said.\n \n\n   \n  Nowadays, Chess.com is home to over 230 million members, sees more than one billion moves being played every day, and is valued at over $1 billion with no venture backing, according to the company. During those early years as a start-up, the only financial backing the site was ever able to receive was a $70,000 temporary loan from the mom of Allebest’s friend.\n \n\n   \n  As one of the biggest organizations in the sport, Chess.com has also had to weather its fair share of controversy, most notably a  cheating scandal  involving an accusation from Magnus Carlsen that Hans Niemann cheated in an over-the-board game. Niemann was  eventually cleared of cheating  in that particular match.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch said that the episode taught the people involved with Chess.com that it had “way more influence than we thought we did.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the meteoric rise and the sway the site now has over the sport, Rensch and his colleagues see themselves as guiding hands.\n \n\n   \n  “We really are the shepherds of something that belongs to humanity and we do not take that for granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is we always had a bit of an existential – viewing ourselves from 30,000 feet – view that this was kind of bigger than us and that we owed chess the opportunity to reach more people.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/faa-workers-without-paycheck","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:30:00-04:30","title":"The stress is just always there, as thousands of FAA workers go without paycheck","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown in October 2025, thousands of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) workers—including radar technicians and air traffic controllers—are being required to work without pay.

It’s his schedule.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has omitted her husband’s name to maintain his anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  The schedules at the FAA are demanding – oftentimes controllers work long hours through the evenings or overnights, making critical decisions and setting personal life aside to maintain the safety of the flying public.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman said it is “hard to not get personal about it,” knowing that her husband has missed years with their four children already, and now he’s not getting paid to do his job and support his family. Her husband has built up exhaustion and resentment, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “(Being an air traffic controller) has been my husband’s dream for almost two decades and in the last five years, I have only seen a decline in his mindset,” she said. “He loves the work, he is angry that the federal government could get away treating them the way they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, some controllers are calling out sick causing a rippling effect of staffing shortages and delays.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to this shutdown, the family had taken out a loan to complete some much-needed repairs around their home. That included new windows, a new roof and more, she said. Now, they’re left to cut costs elsewhere to ensure bills get paid. She said the family keeps the heat off in the house for as long as possible and mostly uses firewood to keep warm.\n \n\n   \n  “As a spouse, watching your significant other feel the full weight of the financial strain of the family while also being unable to physically be present is painful and stressful,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman stays home to take care of their children, but since the shutdown she has been looking for an online job to help their family while still managing their schedules.\n \n\n   \n  “In our family, the stress is just always there, just because the career itself is already extremely stressful and takes a lot of time away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    No end in sight\n \n\n   \n  For now, Schmidt is calling creditors to figure out what bills must be paid. He takes side jobs to make extra cash, and many of his colleagues are doing the same, he said. Schmidt’s union, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, represents about 11,000 FAA employees. About 5,000 of them, like Schmidt, are working without pay during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay strong and do my job with dignity and with the best of my ability,” Schmidt said. “I don’t think I could handle if I was responsible for a loss of life, a loss of lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Keeping the public safe is something that drives many aviation workers, even when they aren’t getting paid, despite the hardships on their families.\n \n\n   \n  As the holidays approach, Wiseman’s family of six is already making adjustments to pinch pennies where needed. She’s canceled or postponed doctor’s appointments, chiropractic care and vet appointments to avoid co-pays or bills piling up.\n \n\n   \n  All four of Wiseman’s children are in their pre-teen to teenage years, involved in activities and costly sports. One has even started driving, which helps Wiseman keep up with the schedules, but adds another cost given high car insurance rates for a new driver.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been just trying to be very frugal, like extra spending at a very bare minimum,” she said, noting the family doesn’t eat out anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman’s children carpool for sports to avoid additional expenses. The couple is not sending their youngest son to an out-of-state hockey tournament in two weeks because of the financial strain it would cause. He’s a goalie.\n \n\n   \n  The family has been through this before. In January 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers, which didn’t include Wiseman’s husband, to call out sick helped end that 35-day long shutdown. Their absence temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  How this shutdown will end is anyone’s guess, but for now these families are struggling to cover their costs as they still report to work.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/louvre-jewels-heist-arrests-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00-04:00","title":"Five new suspects arrested over Louvre heist – but still no sign of looted jewels","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major security breach, five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre museum, bringing the total number of suspects to seven.

are coming for your spring wardrobes \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:48 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  First it took hold at New York Fashion Week. Black feathers spilling out the front of a beige car coat at Brandon Maxwell. An Altuzarra knit two-piece that made its wearer look like they had been tarred and feathered, but beautifully rather than as some heinous ancient punishment. A strapless gown that appeared cloud-like through rows and rows of delicate white plumes at Prabal Gurung.\n \n\n   \n  The London shows were in on the game too — the cascading, multi-colored plumage of a Roksanda evening gown, or feral, feather-stuffed Converse high tops at Oscar Ouyang. In  Paris , designers moved with the synchronization of a swallow murmuration. Pierpaolo Piccoli’s proposition for Balenciaga rested on feather-work: There was the full, plume-covered maxi skirt paired with a casual T-shirt, since worn in the wild by Elle Fanning, as well as a number of boxy dresses finished with delicate feather trims.\n \n\n   \n  For Chanel,  Matthieu Blazy  set its specialist atelier Maison Lemarié on the task of creating feather Camellias, headpieces, earrings and large skirts. At Victoria Beckham the dresses were smaller, but no less quilled. Even The Row, the cult favorite of every millennial minimalist, dipped its toe into the showy textile with mid-length skirts that were given a feathery facade. Stella McCartney, fashion’s stalwart eco-warrior, joined in too with the invention of the world’s first plant-based alternative to feathers.\n \n\n   \n  There was Big Bird Energy all over the runways this season. But how did bird feathers become a symbol of luxury in the first place?\n \n\n   \n  Plumage has been in fashion since ancient Egypt, when ostrich feathers were used to decorate fans and even appeared in hieroglyphics. In Babylonian and Assyrian artworks, too, feathers are often seen covering the bodies of deities or embellishing royal crowns.\n \n\n   \n  Around the mid-1500s, feathers entered the wardrobes of real people, at least in the UK. “That’s when they start to be worn specifically for fashionable reasons,” said Dr. Elisabeth Gernerd — a fashion historian and professor at De Montfort University in England. The ever-practical Brits worked with what they had to hand; attaching goose, chicken and egrets feathers that had been sterilized in chalk and sulfur to hats and fans. But while the material was fairly common, working people often reserved it for more everyday tools like making brooms or bedding.\n \n\n   \n   18th century trend-setter Marie Antoinette  popularized the style of having large, stately plumes — usually ostrich, the most prominent feather globally traded — erupting from a tower of hair. So giant were these headpieces, newspapers at the time often wrote salaciously about whose feathers caught fire from a candlelight at which ball. But it wasn’t until the 19th century, as the British Empire expanded and global trade routes became more established, that the “feather craze” reached its peak, according to Gernerd.\n \n\n   \n  Birds of paradise from islands such as New Guinea were hunted and skinned, then exported to Europe and the US, where they were sold to milliners at auctions in London, Paris and Amsterdam. Their exotic feathers became associated with a new level of luxury and access. “In the 19th century, the Empire was in fashion and feathers are a way to display that fashion,” said Gernerd. “You’re wearing something that has travelled thousands of miles to get to you. You’re a symbol of growing Imperialism and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just the odd plume, either. Entire hummingbirds were taxidermied and mounted on circular, feathered fans in the 1870s; while larger preserved birds adorned velvet bonnets. By the 1900s, millions of birds had been killed for the feather trade, threatening the extinction of several species. Demand was so high, the millinery industry was even pricing out American ornithologists from buying specimens for scientific research. When the Titanic sank in 1912, one of the most valuable commodities onboard was a container of ostrich feathers being shipped to New York. “They were insured for around $2.3 million in today’s money,” Gernerd said. “They were worth essentially as much as diamonds.”\n \n\n   \n  But the style wasn’t universally accepted, and some campaigned against the mass slaughtering of the endangered animals. Harriet Hemenway and Minna B. Hall, two Boston socialites, turned against the fashion of their peers — launching a series of tea parties to attempt to dissuade other high-society women from wearing feathers. They founded the Audubon Society, an environmental conservation group, in 1905 — managing to influence state laws, such as the 1910 Audubon Plumage Law which prohibited the sale or possession of feathers from protected birds in New York State. By 1918, they had their first major victory: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a federal law that made it illegal to hunt, capture or sell any migratory bird. In 1921, the UK passed its own anti-plumage legislation which outlawed the importing of exotic birds for fashion. But frustratingly for activists, ostrich — one of the most prominently used feathers in the fashion industry today because of their unique individual filaments and diffused softness — were exempt from conservation laws, according to Gernerd, since their feathers can technically be harvested without killing or skinning the animal.\n \n\n   \n    Are feathers the new fur?\n \n\n   \n  Today, many fashion designers such as Donatella Versace, John Galliano and the late Giorgio Armani, have openly rejected the use of fur after decades of animal welfare campaigns — while luxury brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada and Burberry have also committed to going fur-free. Earlier this year Conde Nast  announced  it will no longer feature new animal fur in editorial content or advertizing across its numerous publications. But could the success of the anti-fur movement be fueling a plume boom?\n \n\n   \n  “Fashion designers are definitely using ostrich feathers as an alternative to fur, but it’s an ill informed decision to do so,” said Emma Håkansson, founder of ethical fashion activist group Collective Fashion Justice, in a phone interview. “Because we don’t want to kill animals specifically for fashion, we’re just replicating that same problem with a different species here.” Despite the fact ostrich feathers can be harvested without slaughtering, Collective Fashion Justice  published research  in 2023 that found all ostrich feather production systems ultimately kill the bird.\n \n\n   \n  It was Håkansson and her team who worked with Copenhagen Fashion Week to ban all wildlife materials on its runways in 2024, and who convinced the British Fashion Council to prohibit the use of fur and exotic animal skins later that year. Currently they are lobbying organizers at New York, Paris and Milan to commit to similar bans, and Håkansson is “hopeful” that their dialogue will lead to action.\n \n\n   \n  But change needs innovation, as well as restriction, to stick. One of the most feather-filled shows of the Spring-Summer 2026 season came from Stella McCartney. According to the fashion house, the plant-based “Fevvers” used to adorn dresses are the world’s “first ethical alternative” to bird feathers. Inventors Nicola Woollon and James West, who have protected the technology with a strict Non Disclosure Agreement, used Stella McCartney’s runway as a proof of concept. The idea, they told CNN, only took a few intense months of development.\n \n\n   \n  “With so many brands trying to move beyond animal-derived materials, it felt like the right moment to reimagine something so loaded with history and emotion,” Woollen told CNN in an email. “The conversation around materials has mostly focused on leather and fur. Feathers slipped through the next, and we wanted to change that,” West added.\n \n\n   \n  Their first foray into faux feathers took inspiration from ostrich — the final frontier animal campaigners couldn’t restrict over 100 years ago. “Ostrich feathers are the ones most associated with couture and cruelty in equal measure. We wanted to reclaim that form and give it new meaning,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the feather-filled runways of the latest season, it’s developments like Fevvers that keep Håkansson going. “What I hope people come to realize is that having policies in place that make fashion more ethical and sustainable is not restrictive of creativity,” she said. “It actually helps to produce more of it, because you have to think outside the box a bit more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/democratic-senators-us-military-strikes-briefing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:50:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration cuts Democrats out of a briefing on US military strikes, top Senate Dem says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration held a classified briefing with Republican lawmakers on U.S. military strikes against suspected drug-smuggling boats, excluding Democratic members and withholding key legal justifications such as a Justice Department OLC memo.

EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials briefed Republicans on Wednesday about  US military strikes on suspected drug boats  without telling Democratic members about the briefing, according to a top Senate Democrat and a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner slammed the Trump administration for cutting out Democratic lawmakers Wednesday, calling the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n  During the briefing, administration officials showed the Republicans a classified Justice Department OLC memo outlining the administration’s legal justification for the strikes, which CNN  first reported  on earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Warner said, “shutting Democrats out of a briefing on U.S. military strikes and withholding the legal justification for those strikes from half the Senate is indefensible and dangerous.”\n \n\n   \n  “Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party,” he said. “For any administration to treat them that way erodes our national security and flies in the face of Congress’ constitutional obligation to oversee matters of war and peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “It also sets a reckless and deeply troubling precedent,” the Virginia Democrat continued, adding that the administration should immediately provide Democrats the same briefing and the OLC opinion.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Warner’s comments come as the Trump administration accelerates its attacks against boats that they allege are involved in drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that the US military  conducted another strike against a vessel  in the Pacific Ocean that day, killing four people.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  The action marks the 14th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel. The operations have killed 61 people aboard 15 total boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration told CNN earlier this week that it has provided  seven separate classified briefings  on US military strikes on alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  But some lawmakers have said they have not received the information they want. One Democratic Senate aide told CNN that the administration “appears to be counting the same briefing given multiple times to certain staff or members (including in small groups.) So seven briefings is highly misleading.”\n \n\n   \n  House Armed Services Committee members are expected to get a classified briefing from Pentagon officials on Thursday about the recent US military strikes on boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, two sources told CNN earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/food-banks-snap-funding-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Food banks face a ‘perfect storm’ of surging demand as shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 'perfect storm' of rising demand and reduced supply is threatening food banks across the U.S. as the federal government shutdown continues and federal food benefits, including SNAP, are set to be suspended in November.

Meanwhile, a Florida charity is giving out 300,000 meals per day but, an official there says, “still it’s not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  After a nearly monthlong  government shutdown , the looming  suspension of federal food benefits  in November is poised to put millions of Americans at risk of going hungry — and food banks and other charities across the country face a bleak outlook as they head into a busy holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen large and small charitable nonprofits told CNN they have exceeded their ability to help and warned that the level of support they can provide will fall far short.\n \n\n   \n  “The real impacts are starting now,” said Brian Greene, CEO of Houston Food Bank. “There’s been some uptick, but nowhere near what we’re going to see by the time we get to early November. … it’s going to be unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  With Thanksgiving just weeks away, hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay are becoming new faces at food banks and other charities, which are also bracing for more demand as the Trump administration signals that it doesn’t have the funds to provide food stamps to nearly 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors combine to form a “perfect storm” that will push charities past their brink, said Miette Michie, a board member of the Emergency Food Network, which serves parts of central Virginia. The volunteer-based food distribution site has consistently been at capacity since the shutdown began, Michie said — at which point all the volunteers can do is tell people to call back the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you angry. … You’re messing with people’s lives here,” Michie told CNN. “This is not just a game, it’s actual people, working people, whose lives are being affected by this.”\n \n\n   \n  Dave Silbert, who leads So What Else, a food bank in Washington, DC, told CNN that “it’s brought a level of chaos and uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  “How do we expand?” he asked. “How do we go from 450,000 pounds of food to 550 or 600,000 pounds of food a week? How do we go from raising $300,000 a month to $400,000 a month?”\n \n\n   \n    States rush to provide support\n \n\n   \n  States across the country are working to fill the gap on their own.\n \n\n   \n  California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster have deployed their state’s National Guard troops to support food banks, and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican,  has signaled he’s prepared  to do so as well.\n \n\n   \n  New Mexico, Minnesota, Washington and West Virginia have announced millions in funding to support relief programs, while Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, is setting up its own food-assistance system for residents who receive SNAP benefits. That program is expected to cost $37.5 million a week and can be funded through November from the state’s surplus, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  But not every state is able to match federal funding. Several nonprofit directors told CNN that food banks were always meant to supplement, not replace, federal aid programs and that the timing of this influx of need will only further stretch social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in Georgia, for example, receive about $250 million in SNAP benefits monthly. Food banks distribute only about $4.5 million worth of food each month, said Amy Breitmann, the CEO Golden Harvest Food Bank, which serves 24 counties in that state and South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  “The food bank is supposed to be the safety net underneath SNAP, right?” Breitmann said. “It’s not supposed to replace that.”\n \n\n   \n    Food banks already reeling from federal cuts\n \n\n   \n  The surge in demand at food banks across the country comes months after the Trump administration terminated millions  in funding for a program  that allowed food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Higgerson, Chief Development Officer of Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, said that there’s been “an erosion of the federal food support,” over the past year. A quarter of the food the Second Harvest Food Bank distributes comes from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Between the shutdown and an already-lost millions of dollars from federal budget cuts this year, the situation is “unprecedented” for the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, a charity that has scrambled to launch pop-up shops in areas with the most SNAP-reliant and federal-worker-heavy communities, said president and CEO Amy Beros. Her group lost $2 million when the local food purchasing program was cut earlier this year and had roughly 80 truckloads cancelled from the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n \n\n   \n  “We know there’s no way for the food banks to fully fill the gap,” Beros said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/chicago-immigration-gregory-bovino-appeal-granted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-04:00","title":"Top Border Patrol official to be deposed Thursday over agency’s tactics in the Chicago area","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino is set to appear in court for a deposition regarding the tactics used by federal agents during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, a targeted immigration enforcement initiative that has led to over 3,000 arrests.

scheduled to last up to five hours. It comes a day after an appeals court halted a judge’s order requiring him to  provide her daily court briefings  on his agents’ activities.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise order Wednesday came just hours before Bovino was meant to brief US District Judge Sara Ellis, who told him Tuesday he must be in court every weekday for the next week as she considers reports that federal agents were not following her order to limit aggressive tactics and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration quickly pressed a federal appeals court to put her order on hold, arguing that Bovino having to appear would be “extraordinarily disruptive” and “irreparably harming the government.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’ requirement “significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.\n \n\n   \n  In a Wednesday afternoon ruling, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted their request, meaning Bovino did not make an appearance in court Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  As the Trump administration carries out targeted immigration enforcement in several major US cities, Bovino has emerged as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago. The targeted operation has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  But the operation has also drawn persistent protests outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, just outside Chicago. While federal agents say threatening protest activity has led them to intensify their crowd control tactics, demonstrators argue their response is often disproportionate.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court’s decision is intended to give the intermediate court time to review a request from the Trump administration to completely scrap Ellis’ order regarding Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Wednesday ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is “thrilled this act of judicial overreach has been paused.”\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear whether Bovino will appear in court to brief the judge Thursday.   \n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a group of protesters, local journalists and clergy members sued the Trump administration, accusing federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators without warning and unlawfully restricting the press.\n \n\n   \n  Before the appeals court ruling, Bovino told Fox News he was anticipating the meetings with the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s gonna have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino said on Fox’s  “The Faulkner Focus”  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino appeared before Ellis on Tuesday after the plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has refuted.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’  restraining order , which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on protesters unless there is an “immediate threat to safety.” It also requires clear warnings before these methods are used.\n \n\n   \n  During Tuesday’s hearing, Ellis expressed concern that her order was not being followed. She cited videos of interactions between agents and crowds, which she said appeared to show agents firing gas without notice and with no apparent threat.\n \n\n   \n  “Halloween is on Friday,” Ellis said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge provided guidance on how agents should comply with the order, including wearing body cameras to document interactions, wearing visible identification and providing clear warnings before deploying gas.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis ordered that all use-of-force reports and body camera footage during those interactions for Operation Midway Blitz from September 2 through last Satur﻿day be turned over to the court under seal by the end of this week.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for next week.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/asia/us-north-korea-trump-kim-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"03:52:00-04:00","title":"Trump Departs Asia Without Meeting Kim Jong Un; North Koreans Don’t Seem to Care","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During President Donald Trump’s 2025 Asia tour, which included stops in Malaysia, Tokyo, and South Korea, a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to materialize.

North Koreans don’t seem to care \n       \n  Analysis by Will Ripley, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald Trump  danced on the tarmac  in Malaysia,  met Japan’s emperor  in Tokyo, and  accepted a gold crown  in South Korea, one key question kept following him – would he hold a surprise meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un?\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions  Trump made public overtures  that he’d “love” to meet Kim while in the region. It could have been a made-for-TV sequel to his  surprise 2019 visit at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) , when Trump made history as the first sitting US president to step foot on North Korean soil.\n \n\n   \n  In the end it never came together. And in Pyongyang, just a few hundred miles away, it was like Trump’s trip never happened.\n \n\n   \n  There were no headlines. No television news reports. No mention of the US president’s offer to “work very hard with Kim Jong Un” to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. Even as Trump’s entourage rolled through Asia and speculation swirled about a possible reunion between the two leaders, North Korean state media stayed silent.\n \n\n   \n  American filmmaker and manager at  Young Pioneer Tours  Justin Martell just returned from an eight-day trip to Pyongyang, where he was attending an international film festival that happened to coincide with much of Trump’s Asia trip.\n \n\n   \n  He said most people he spoke with in Pyongyang didn’t even know Trump was in the region, and none were aware that Trump wanted to meet Kim again.\n \n\n   \n  “They weren’t negative about it,” he told CNN. “They weren’t overly hopeful either. They just kept repeating Kim Jong Un’s recent remarks — that while he has warm memories of President Trump, politics are different from feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  Martell said the tone wasn’t hostile, just detached. “It was more or less, ‘Here’s how we feel right now. If it happens, great. If not, it doesn’t really change much.’”\n \n\n   \n  That matter-of-fact indifference marks a striking change from 2018 and 2019, when Trump’s summits with Kim — first in Singapore, then in Hanoi, and later at the DMZ — gripped both capitals and dominated global headlines.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to 2025 and Trump’s overtures barely registered. But there’s good reason for that.\n \n\n   \n  Only last month Kim stood side-by-side with China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in the heart of Beijing at a historic military parade in an unprecedented and  historic show of unity  against the West.\n \n\n   \n  Kim now has Moscow for weapons deals and oil, Beijing for trade, and a domestic narrative of resilience under sanctions and  heroism on the battlefield in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  Frankly, a handshake with the US president no longer carries the weight it once did.\n \n\n   \n    Why the meeting didn’t happen\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the missed meeting with Kim was  “a matter of timing.” \n \n\n   \n  “We never were able to talk because… look I was so busy,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Thursday after departing South Korea and ending his Asia tour.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was also away on a diplomatic mission of her own this week. She first flew to Russia for a  meeting with Putin  to discuss strengthening ties before speaking at an international forum in Belarus.\n \n\n   \n  That made it logistically impossible for North Korea’s top diplomat to help arrange any last-minute meeting between Kim and Trump  as she did in 2019 , when Choe helped pull together the DMZ meeting just hours after  Trump posted on social media  he wanted to meet Kim.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, North Korea test-fired cruise missiles to the west of the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump’s visit, during which he held a summit with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung.\n \n\n   \n  But as Martell’s conversations in Pyongyang suggest, timing may be only part of the story. North Korea simply may no longer feel strongly compelled to say yes.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has made his terms clear: he’ll meet Trump only if Washington abandons what he calls its  “absurd obsession” with denuclearization . In a September speech, he said he still has “fond memories” of Trump, but that his country “will never trade away nuclear weapons to be free of sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, the deal Trump offered six years ago – trading sanctions relief for disarmament – is no longer on the table. North Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.\n \n\n   \n  What Martell saw in Pyongyang underscores why.\n \n\n   \n  The North Korean elite in Pyongyang – whose support is crucial to maintaining national stability, despite Kim’s near-absolute power – appear to be enjoying a higher living standard than previously, with more access to modern technology and amenities. For the elite, at least, sanctions have done little to dent their lives.\n \n\n   \n  Even South Korea’s President Lee seems to recognize the challenges in bringing Kim to the table.\n \n\n   \n   In an interview with me this week , Lee said he hopes Trump can act as a “peacemaker,” while Seoul plays “pacemaker” — creating the conditions for dialogue that remain “difficult” to achieve directly. “If the two leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together,” Lee said, “we would welcome such engagement.”\n \n\n   \n    High-rises and traffic jams in ‘Pyonghattan’\n \n\n   \n  Martell had not been to Pyongyang since 2017. The capital’s development over the past eight years, despite sanctions and the extreme isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, stunned him.\n \n\n   \n  “It used to feel much less developed compared to others in the region,” he said. “Now, honestly, Pyongyang feels very much like a modern city.”\n \n\n   \n  He described futuristic high-rises, residents paying with QR codes, new domestic apps for ordering taxis and food, and social media.\n \n\n   \n  “What used to take twenty minutes now takes forty,” he said, referring to the traffic. “We kept joking with our Korean guides that it was Pyonghattan” because it has developed so much.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the capital’s new Hwasong district, he dined at sleek restaurants offering both Asian and Western menus, with high-end liquor on display. He says all the restaurants were full of locals dining when he visited.\n \n\n   \n  Private car ownership was once rare and politically sensitive. Now, it’s common enough to cause occasional traffic jams in busy areas. “There seems to be a burgeoning middle class now,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  Even outside the capital, he saw evidence of growth. Traveling two hours north to Mount Myohyang, he noticed new housing under construction. “For farmers, too,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite sanctions, he said, “the DPRK seems to be in a much different position than it was ten years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  At a national gallery near Kim Il Sung Square, he saw new murals commemorating 80 years of the Workers’ Party. Toward the end, one section vividly depicted North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Large North Korean-style murals of soldiers fighting Ukrainians — and winning,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Even North Korean cinema has evolved. At the Pyongyang International Film Festival, Martell watched Days and Nights of Confrontation, a new state-produced thriller dramatizing a real-life plot to assassinate Kim Jong Il.\n \n\n   \n  The film featured violence, modern production values, and even brief nudity — all unheard-of in North Korean films. “A character getting suffocated with a plastic bag — that’s something I’ve certainly never seen in a DPRK movie,” he said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s portrait still ‘front and center’\n \n\n   \n  Despite the silence around Trump’s latest Asia visit, he has not been erased from Pyongyang’s official memory.\n \n\n   \n  Martell’s group was the first Western delegation in years to visit the International Friendship Exhibition, a sprawling mountainside museum that displays gifts and artifacts from foreign dignitaries. Taking photos inside the exhibition is strictly forbidden.\n \n\n   \n  “In the section devoted to Kim Jong Un, there were the expected photos — Putin, Lavrov, Xi Jinping, Dennis Rodman,” Martell said. “And President Trump was still there, displayed very prominently.”\n \n\n   \n  Based on my experiences traveling to the country, if the door were truly closed to future dialogue, that photo would probably have been removed.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s still displayed very much front and center,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump has indicated he still wants to meet Kim when he next comes to Asia. “We’ll have other visits, and we’ll work very hard with Kim Jong Un and with everybody on getting things straightened out,” he told reporters on Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/us-strikes-another-boat-pacific","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:49:00-04:00","title":"US military strikes another boat in the Pacific, killing 4","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 29, 2025, the U.S. military conducted a strike in the Pacific Ocean, killing four people aboard a vessel suspected of narcotics smuggling.

moved across Jamaica, seen for the first time from space in new satellite images obtained from Vantor.\n \n\n   \n  The storm made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a monstrous Category 5 hurricane before moving onto to Cuba on Wednesday and later, the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  These aerial images show widespread flooding and  extensive damage  in towns along Jamaica’s southwest coast in the parish of St. Elizabeth and, on the opposite side of the island in Montego Bay, the capital of St. James parish. The storm first made landfall on Jamaica’s southwest coast near the town of Black River, seen in part here.\n \n\n   \n  Damage to homes, businesses and community centers in Black River is extensive – even seen in this limited scope. This satellite photo taken after the storm shows the roof of one of the largest markets in the neighborhood ripped cleanly off its foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Coastal communities were hit hardest by the storm’s devastating winds, with some remote fishing villages nearly flattened by the hurricane. In the town of White House, less than 10 miles northwest of Black River, small boats were washed ashore in a town where the economy is reliant on its closeness to the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  As the storm progressed north, it drenched rural farmlands across St. Elizabeth Parish, a southwestern region that’s become Jamaica’s breadbasket. Footage captured on the ground showed just how quickly the low-lying farmlands were submerged by rainwater.\n \n\n   \n  An image captured less than 24 hours after the floodwaters rushed in shows inundated farmlands and vegetation stripped from large swathes of agricultural land.\n \n\n   \n  On the opposite coast, Hurricane Melissa swept through Montego Bay, in Jamaica’s north. This satellite image captured in its aftermath shows extensive flooding throughout the city and large pools of water around storage facilities at the city’s main port.\n \n\n   \n  As the storm moved out to sea, it pulled debris and muddy water through the Barnett and Pye Rivers, seen at the center of the frame. The debris appears as a large cloud of dirty water seen beyond the shoals off Montego Bay.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/redistricting-rebellion-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Both Democratic and GOP-led states are starting to rebel against the national redistricting push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"National political leaders, particularly Republicans, are pushing states to redraw congressional district lines mid-decade to gain an advantage in the 2026 House elections, spurred by President Donald Trump’s political campaign efforts.

     \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  National political leaders are making frantic, last-ditch efforts in multiple states to  redraw more US House districts  ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  But their ambitions face big political and procedural obstacles and in some cases, open rebellion from state lawmakers pushing back against pressure from the top leaders in their own parties.\n \n\n   \n  Consider Kansas, where Republican lawmakers are trying to force a special session and join the wave of states undertaking once-rare, mid-decade redistricting to gain an edge in the 2026 congressional elections. GOP leaders this week were working to secure the signatures from two-thirds of lawmakers in both chambers needed to bypass the state’s Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and proceed. On the line: the US House seat currently held by four-term Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s terrible for democracy,” said Kansas state Rep. Mark Schreiber, one of the remaining Republican holdouts, in an interview with CNN. “It’s fairly simple: Redistricting was meant to accommodate changes in the population, based on the decennial census, and that’s it.”\n \n\n   \n  “This mid-cycle redistricting is being done only for political purposes, in this case to maintain a Republican majority in the US House,” Schreiber added. “I don’t think that’s an appropriate use.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have faced resistance as they ramp up their redistricting campaign. In Maryland, for instance, a top Democratic lawmaker has balked at taking up map-drawing, warning it will only escalate the ongoing redistricting arms race and help Republicans in the end. National Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections. If Democrats gain three seats next year, they will win the House and obtain the power to block parts of President Donald Trump’s agenda. But Republicans have more opportunities than Democrats do to shape the election outcome through congressional mapmaking.\n \n\n   \n  So far, GOP lawmakers have redrawn seats in three states – Texas, Missouri and North Carolina – to add a  total of seven potential seats  to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the Democrats’ push\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the political arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to undertake redistricting and create five additional GOP-friendly seats. Next week, California voters will decide whether to counter that and  approve five additional Democratic-friendly seats , representing the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state.\n \n\n   \n  The states now eyeing new maps represent “the third-tier opportunities for redistricting,” said Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of Inside Elections, an independent political newsletter. But, he said, “in order to squeeze an advantage, you have to go piecemeal once you get beyond the big hitters. For Democrats, especially, California is all they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia, a purple state where Democrats hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature, is potentially the biggest remaining redistricting prize for the party. Democrats currently hold six of the state’s 11 seats in the US House, and an aggressive map redraw could potentially give the party nine or 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  But it will take a monthslong effort to get there as lawmakers tackle multiple hurdles to bypass the redistricting process the state established five years ago. Under current law, the power to redistrict rests with a bipartisan redistricting commission created by voters through a constitutional amendment.\n \n\n   \n  First, Democrats must pass language to amend the state constitution before Tuesday’s elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Then, it must be approved again next year in a second legislative session before voters have their say in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Republicans have signaled that they intend to mount legal challenges to any action by the legislature, arguing that Democrats already have run afoul of a requirement to pass the proposed constitutional amendment before the election since early voting is underway.\n \n\n   \n  The US House’s top Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is working to persuade Illinois lawmakers to eke out an additional seat there, despite objections from the head of the state Senate’s Black caucus. In Jeffries’ home state of New York, a  new lawsuit  by a leading Democratic-aligned elections firm takes aim at the sole Republican-held seat in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting with Jeffries this week, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said in a statement that “all options must remain on the table to protect our democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  But at least one Democrat in the state – state Sen. Willie Preston, who heads the Black caucus in his chamber – has opposed it, arguing the new map risks diluting Black political power in the state. Preston is running for a US House seat now held by Rep. Robin Kelly. Kelly is running for an open US Senate seat to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.\n \n\n   \n  “Black Democrats have given our all to our party - the answer to fighting back against Trump’s efforts to crush Black political power cannot be diluting Black political power,” Preston said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  In deep-blue Maryland, the state Senate President William Ferguson has publicly opposed map-drawing targeting the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation. But other Democrats, including Jeffries, insisted Wednesday that redistricting remains a viable option in the state.\n \n\n   \n    Rare GOP resistance to Trump\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, the most immediate battleground is Indiana, where GOP Gov. Mike Braun has announced a special legislative session starting next week to tackle a redistricting plan that could possibly yield two more seats for his party – although it’s uncertain that the plan has enough support among Republicans in the state Senate majority to succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Some Indiana Republicans have been among those resisting Trump’s moves, despite significant lobbying by the president and two visits to the state by Vice President JD Vance. Braun, a staunch Trump ally, has called legislators back to the statehouse to start working on a redraw next week.\n \n\n   \n  But on the same day that Braun announced the legislative session, Molly Swigart, a spokeswoman for the top Republican in the state Senate, said there still were not enough Republican votes to support redistricting in that chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Wednesday for an update, Swigart   responded: “I do not have anything new to share.”\n \n\n   \n  Prominent Republicans in the state, including former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, have opposed the redistricting. Under the current map, the GOP holds seven of the state’s nine US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent Washington Post column , Daniels said the current map is fair and urged Republicans in the Hoosier State to continue to resist. “Someone has to lead in climbing out of this mudhole,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “We generally pride ourselves in doing what’s right, not what’s easy,” Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and former Indiana lawmaker, told CNN. “We take our time. We weigh things.”\n \n\n   \n  In another Republican-controlled state, Louisiana lawmakers this week took steps that could give their party an edge next year. Legislators voted to delay the state’s 2026 primary elections by a month to give them more time to draw new congressional lines if the US Supreme Court decides a redistricting case in the state’s favor.\n \n\n   \n    ‘An incredible Pandora’s box’\n \n\n   \n  While Republicans have structural advantages that allow them to rack up more seats through redistricting than Democrats can, Rubashkin of Inside Elections said the final outcome of the ongoing redistricting battle is unclear, particularly if next year becomes a wave election for Democrats, akin to 2018 midterm elections when the party gained more than 40 House seats during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “If the partisan, national environment is favorable enough to one party or the other, you cannot redistrict your way into the majority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, Rubashkin added, the redistricting push now underway likely has changed US politics, by opening “an incredible Pandora’s box … that will persist long after this election cycle. I don’t see what will stop states that have the capacity from simply redrawing every two years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/louvre-heist-suspects-investigation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:56:00-20:56","title":"Louvre Heist Suspects Admit Involvement in Jewels Theft","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a brazen daylight heist on October 19, 2025, thieves broke into the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery using a truck-mounted ladder to steal nine high-value items from the French Crown Jewels, including an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon and jewelry worn by queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense.

The pair had “partially admitted” their involvement under questioning, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The heist – a brazen, seven-minute daylight raid on the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery – captured the world’s attention after thieves escaped with jewels worth tens of millions.\n \n\n   \n  The two men were arrested Saturday evening and held in custody, where they were questioned for 96 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Police arrested a third suspect in the Paris region on Wednesday evening, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported on Thursday, citing sources. That suspect was in police custody, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. He was previously known to police for aggravated theft. His DNA was found on glass that had been broken from one of the display cases, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “There is nothing to suggest that the four perpetrators benefited from any form of inside help within the museum,” Beccuau. said in a Wednesday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The crime of theft as part of an organized gang carries a potential 15-year prison sentence and a heavy fine, the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt, and authorities were able to track down the individuals after analyzing more than 150 DNA samples and examining several items the group left behind, such as gloves, a helmet and high-vis jackets left at the scene.\n \n\n   \n  One of the men was arrested at Charles de Gaulle Airport as he attempted to leave the country. He was stopped during a passport check before he could board an evening flight to Algeria.\n \n\n   \n  The stolen jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were not recovered during the arrests.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre’s upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels, on October 19. They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window. They broke into two high-security display cases and made off with nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million).\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to keep the hope that they will be found and could be returned to the Louvre museum and the nation,” Beccuau added. “These jewels are now unsellable. Anyone who buys them would be guilty of the offence of handling stolen goods. There is still time to return them.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.

\n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Wayne Chang, Will Ripley, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:45 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Days before President  Donald Trump  departed for Asia where he will sit down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday for their first in-person meeting of his second term, the president refused to count out the possibility of America’s position on Taiwan getting tangled in US-China trade talks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be talking about a lot of things. I assume that’s going to be one of the things, but I’m not going to talk about that now,” Trump said when asked about reports that China may pressure the US to oppose Taiwan’s independence in exchange for a larger trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to definitively count out Taiwan becoming a pawn in trade talks between the world’s two largest economies comes as Trump has privately and publicly suggested he believes China will not invade the self-ruled island that Beijing claims it owns while he is in office – raising questions about how seriously the president will prioritize boosting Taiwan’s defense during his second term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump again gave an evasive answer on Taiwan as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One en route to South Korea Wednesday for the Asia-Pacific Cooperation summit where he will sit down with Xi, saying he is  not even sure  the topic will be raised by the Chinese leader. A senior administration official expressed confidence that Trump would not be backed into stating opposition to Taiwan’s independence during the meeting, adding that the meeting will be focused on Xi “holding a gun to the head of the global economy” with its critical mineral export controls.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said over the weekend that no one in the administration is contemplating a trade deal that includes “favorable treatment” for walking away from Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Some experts remain worried, however, that Trump might be willing to make concessions on Taiwan for a better trade deal, but former Trump administration officials argue that those concerns are over-blown.\n \n\n   \n  “That idea of a grand bargain, of Trump selling out Taiwan, gets most of its oxygen from Chinese Communist Party trial balloons that are floated in US media, and from isolationists on the far left and the far right who believe in appeasement,”   said Matt Pottinger, Chairman of the China Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Trump’s former deputy national security advisor. “Trump understands the strategic nature of Taiwan.”\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is also publicly downplaying concerns about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting, and with a senior Taiwan government official saying they are “cautiously optimistic” about the meeting and pointing to Rubio’s latest remarks as an encouraging sign.\n \n\n   \n  Whenever leaders of the United States and China meet, Taiwan’s government is closely watching and calibrating its own strategy. Very little is typically said publicly given the precarious position Taipei finds itself in – wedged between two superpowers with vastly conflicting agendas and interests.\n \n\n   \n  And Taiwan’s anxieties have amplified in Trump’s second term, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s team is filled with more isolationist and far-right figures than the establishment Republican and Democratic officials who have traditionally shaped US foreign policy. And while Trump has prioritized securing a major trade deal with Beijing, his administration has paused some US military support to the island and complicated basic engagements such as the transit of Taiwan’s president through the US earlier this year, current and former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some stakeholders in Taipei have found it really jarring to be in this position where they’re suddenly so unclear on whether the US president will support them,” said Henrietta Levin, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), adding they have found an “unwelcome surprise” in how challenging it has been to bolster the US-Taiwan relationship this year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went into his first term having taken a phone call from Taiwan’s president  during the transition,  which upended protocol because there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan. His administration then accelerated the sale of weapons to the self-governing island and allowed the transit of Taiwan’s president though the US on multiple occasions – which is in line with past norms.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump came into office for his second term after having repeatedly claimed in recent years that Taiwan “stole” the US chip business, which resonated uneasily in Taipei. He has been careful in public statements about Taiwan, his administration has halted the flow of some weapons from US stockpiles to the island and complicated the transit of the island’s president through the US.\n \n\n   \n    The return of strategic ambiguity, or a downgrade of the relationship?\n \n\n   \n  Some experts make the case that to date, Trump in his second term has acted in line with decades of US policy with a return to strategic ambiguity.\n \n\n   \n  While it may be a hard shift after former President Joe Biden declared multiple times while he was in office that the US would militarily defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, they say it’s not an abnormal approach.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at Obama, Bush before that, it’s always been a little bit of a hands-off approach, and trying to keep Taiwan at arm’s length and being very careful about any messages you sent to China. So, we are somewhat back to that new normal again,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a foreign policy think tank.\n \n\n   \n  But Taiwan is grappling with whether the current state of the relationship with the US is a short-term aberration as Trump focuses on a productive meeting with Xi, or more of a long-term reality.\n \n\n   \n  It has led them to parse over the deeper meaning of every single engagement with the administration – or lack thereof.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this fall, there was a gathering on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly with Taiwan’s foreign minister at Le Bernardin, an upscale New York restaurant. Multiple senior US administration officials were expected to attend but they didn’t show up, according to a source who attended the gathering. Even though the administration signaled through intermediaries that the no-show was simply the unintended consequence of over-packed schedules, it left Taiwan feeling defeated, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The island is actively re-evaluating how they can move to bring the Trump administration to their side, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Facing pressure from both Washington and Beijing, President Lai Ching-te has pledged to raise defense spending sharply to 3.32% of GDP by 2026 and 5% by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  But there are also actions that are being taken – or considered – that won’t attract headlines but could impact the overall relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One option being considered is recalling their de facto ambassador to the US Alexander Yui in order to replace him with a diplomat who is more politically savvy, sources said. Some Trump administration officials have said that the current career diplomat doesn’t have the juice to effectively engage despite support from some close to the president, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan flatly denied that suggestion on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Taiwan and the US maintains a smooth communication channel,” Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, told a legislative committee meeting. “Our representative office in the US has been functioning well. We are not recalling him.”\n \n\n   \n  Taipei has also launched an unprecedented charm offensive aimed at conservative media figures and influencers aligned with Trump’s movement.\n \n\n   \n  President Lai granted  a rare interview  to radio host Buck Sexton, praising Trump and even suggesting he would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he could persuade China to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President  Hsiao Bi-khim spoke with  YouTuber Shawn Ryan, while Taiwan’s de facto ambassador appeared on Steve Bannon’s podcast and hosted Ryan at Twin Oaks, the historic ambassadorial residence in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Such outreach marks a sharp departure from Taipei’s conventional diplomatic approach, underscoring its effort to engage directly with the Trump-aligned ecosystem currently shaping US foreign policy discourse.\n \n\n   \n  Taipei is also trying to offset its US trade deficit by purchasing 6 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alaska, a move officials describe as both an energy-security measure and a goodwill gesture toward Washington while they are still working on a trade deal between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Taiwan is not willing to concede to the US across the board. The island   vowed  to resist pressure  from Washington to shift half of its chip production capacity to the United States, throwing down the gauntlet to the Trump administration just earlier this month. The subject is expected to continue as an active piece of the ongoing trade talks between the US and Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n    Making Taiwan a porcupine ‘without giving Beijing the middle finger’\n \n\n   \n  Chinese leader Xi Jinping views Taiwan’s “reunification” with the mainland as a core requirement for the sweeping vision of a “national rejuvenation” China aims to achieve by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Communist Party officials recently drew up their upcoming five-year plan, which analysts expect will see Beijing prioritize greater economic integration with Taiwan as part of its push for “peaceful reunification.” State media on Monday released a sweeping commentary laying out the many economic carrots it said would be available to Taiwan’s people “after reunification.”\n \n\n   \n  China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has not ruled out using force to take control of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US officials have said that Xi has ordered the country’s military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration plans to adopt a policy on Taiwan with the goal of making the island a “porcupine” by investing strategically in precision and smaller weapons built for asymmetric warfare to deter Chinese aggression or make an invasion so costly and painful that costs would outweigh benefits, two sources briefed on the policy discussions said. US officials also want to get Taiwan to that place “without giving Beijing the middle finger,” the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration refused to green-light the transfer of US weapons stocks to Taiwan earlier this year, under a process known as Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), sources said. The move led to questions about the US military’s commitment to Taiwan. But the move was not meant to signal a complete abdication of US support, sources said. While the administration does not want Taiwan pulling from US weapons stocks — with one administration official pointing out that most of the stockpiled weapons that the US can give to Taiwan would be ineffective in a fight against China — there are no plans to halt sales of weapons which would be purchased by Taiwan, administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Taiwan to put in more orders for military equipment, and they are still waiting on those new orders, the senior administration official said. This private push comes as the administration has made clear that it views the economically prosperous island through the same lens that it views Europe – that it must invest more towards its own defense.\n \n\n   \n  Still, speed needs to be addressed. Taipei is waiting on a backlog of more than $20 billion in undelivered US military equipment, with production times in the US delayed in part because of the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the delayed National Defense Strategy from the Pentagon and internal disagreement over the extent to which the administration plans to prioritize sending military resources to the Western Hemisphere and Europe versus the Pacific is raising questions about the military focus and resources that will actually be put towards Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Dictating the flow of US arms to allies and partners would typically be the job of the defense secretary but the Pentagon has tried to make those calls in recent months with policy memos that have at times been slapped down by Trump directly, sources pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has publicly claimed in recent weeks that Xi won’t invade Taiwan because of US military strength.\n \n\n   \n  “China doesn’t want to do that. First of all, United States is the strongest military power in the world by far, it’s not even close,” Trump said earlier this month. “Nobody’s going to mess with that and I don’t see that at all with President Xi.”\n \n\n   \n  While US officials claim Taiwan must act more quickly to shore up its own defenses, there are concerns on the island that Trump’s personal conviction that Xi will not invade while he is in office could impede the US from effectively boosting their military capabilities in the coming years.\n \n\n   \n  “They are concerned about that, so if there’s no invasion until 2029, but all the time between now and then is wasted, both on the US side and the Taiwanese side, that will set us up for a disaster in 2029 or 2030,” Alperovitch said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/three-star-pushed-out-by-hegseth-caine-over-tensions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: Three-star general pushed out amid tensions with Hegseth","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lt.

Mark Milley  and former Secretary of Defense  Lloyd Austin , one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  McGee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that “General McGee is retiring, and the war department is grateful for his service.” He denied CNN reporting that Hegseth and McGee had clashed.\n \n\n   \n  “Lt Gen. JP McGee will retire after nearly three years of outstanding leadership and service on the Joint Staff. We are grateful for his 35 years of honorable and dedicated service to the Nation,” a Joint Staff spokesperson told CNN. “We owe him a great debt for his service and it is regrettable anonymous sources would put the focus anywhere else.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth has pushed out more than a dozen senior military officials since taking office in January, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown, the Chief of Naval Operations, the directors of the National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, and the top uniformed lawyers for the Army and Air Force.\n \n\n   \n  All were suspected of being insufficiently aligned with Hegseth’s agenda, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senior military officials, including the former director of the Joint Staff Lt. Gen. Doug Sims and the commander of US Southern Command Adm. Alvin Holsey, have been allowed to retire, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Holsey offered to resign amid stark disagreements with Hegseth and Caine over the legality of the US military’s strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean, CNN has reported. Like with McGee, Hegseth had been frustrated that Holsey tended to move too slowly and saw him as an obstacle, according to sources. Holsey announced on October 16 that he would be retiring in December, just one year into the job.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/china/zion-church-crackdown-ezra-jin-trump-xi-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-11:22","title":"Grace Jin Drexel Appeals to Trump to Free Her Father Detained in China Over Church Activities","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Grace Jin Drexel, a U.S. Senate staffer, is urgently appealing for the release of her father, Ezra Jin Mingri, who was detained in China in October 2025 during a widespread crackdown on underground Christian churches, including Zion Church.

She hopes Trump can free him in meeting with Xi \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, and CNN staff\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Grace Jin Drexel couldn’t contact her father on October 10, she tried not to panic. She had just heard that one of the pastors of his underground Christian church in  China  had been detained by authorities; maybe he was busy sorting out the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Then her fears were confirmed. Her father, Ezra Jin Mingri, and dozens of other members of Zion Church had been swept up in a mass crackdown across various congregations and Chinese cities – the largest suppression since  a similar wave of arrests in 2018. \n \n\n   \n  Chinese authorities have long seen Christianity as an unwelcome foreign influence and a threat to government control, experts say – and this crackdown sends a particularly stark message, targeting a well-known church that has been shut down once before.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family, all American citizens living in the US while Jin resided in China, hope a major diplomatic meeting this week might change that.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, US President Donald Trump is  meeting  Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. While trade is expected to dominate the conversation, there are growing calls for Trump to raise the issue of the crackdown and Jin’s detention.\n \n\n   \n  The summit presents “a very unique timing,” said Drexel, who works as a staffer in the US Senate. “We think that the Trump administration’s prioritization of Americans in this scenario also could be helpful for my father as well, to bring a family member of an American citizen home to be with us in the US and safe,” she told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not publicly commented on the issue, and it’s not clear whether it will be on the agenda on Thursday. Tensions remain high between the US and China, which reached a  framework agreement on trade  this week ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, after a series of escalatory tariffs imposed on each other.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family see this as a rare window of opportunity before Jin’s potential indictment for illegally disseminating information online – which, Drexel said, would make his release much harder to negotiate.\n \n\n   \n  She and Jin have some powerful backers, including Secretary of State  Marco Rubio  and members of the  Congressional-Executive Commission on China. \n \n\n   \n  “We must make it clear to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) that the persecution of Christians and other people of faith must stop, and that the United States will use every tool, diplomatic and economic, to hold Chinese Communist officials accountable,” Sen. Ted Cruz said in a video shared by the Hudson Institute think tank, where Drexel’s husband works as a fellow.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, when asked about Rubio’s call for the pastors’ release, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “The Chinese government manages religious affairs in accordance with the law, protecting citizens’ freedom of religious belief and normal religious activities. We firmly oppose the US interfering in China’s internal affairs under the guise of so-called religious issues.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the foreign affairs office in Beihai, where Jin is detained, and to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau for comment.\n \n\n   \n    A string of crackdowns\n \n\n   \n  This crackdown is the latest in a long history of religious suppression in China. Religious practice is legal but tightly controlled and surveilled by the government, which registers “official” state-sanctioned churches.\n \n\n   \n  The government only recognizes five faiths: Chinese Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism and Taoism. Other local spiritual and religious movements have been subject to harsh crackdowns over the years. But that hasn’t stopped communities from creating their own underground, non-registered churches known as “house churches.”\n \n\n   \n  One 44-year-old Christian in Beijing told CNN she’d attended several “house churches,” and had seen plainclothes police officers entering and asking everyone to register themselves.\n \n\n   \n  During previous crackdowns, “when brothers and sisters were arrested, we would all donate money and send someone to visit them in jail and buy them food and clothes,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Zion Church is one such “house church” that the 44-year-old recalled attending in previous years. Jin founded Zion Church in 2007 in Beijing while his family was still living in China; it gradually became one of the largest churches in Beijing, Drexel said.\n \n\n   \n  By 2011, Jin was speaking out about crackdowns on other congregations, in the hopes underground churches might become legally recognized. “We are very aware of what we are doing,” he said in 2011, when he granted CNN rare access to film inside his church. “And we are ready to pay the price.”\n \n\n   \n  That price came in 2018. Drexel described a “pressure campaign” that year, with the government installing facial recognition cameras in the lobby of the church’s building after Jin refused to install them inside the church itself.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to appease the authorities, Jin and his family moved to the US – and when the harassment toward church members in Beijing continued, Jin decided to return to China later that year while his family stayed behind.\n \n\n   \n  That was the last time most of the family saw Jin. The crackdown came soon after; Zion Church was shut down, and Jin was barred from leaving the country. In Chengdu, more than 100 worshipers from a different church were detained, and its pastor, Wang Yi, was jailed for nine years for “inciting subversion of state power.”\n \n\n   \n  Drexel visited her father in 2019 – and she, too, was prevented from leaving China for 11 months, derailing her plans to attend law school. She was eventually allowed to return to the US but hasn’t seen her father since.\n \n\n   \n  After 2018, Jin transformed Zion Church into a semi-virtual network, uploading sermons online and encouraging members around the country to gather and watch sessions together. When the pandemic hit, Zion was quick to adapt to Zoom – and the church’s membership exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the CCP’s own policy of locking people up inside their house, and there was nothing to do for people, a lot of people went to church (online), and it was the only place where you could interact with people,” Drexel said, referring to China’s stringent zero-Covid and lockdown policies at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The church became a national organization that now reaches 10,000 people each day, Drexel said. But there were also signs that it was once again under threat; authorities were watching Jin’s movements closely, and even blocked him from traveling to other cities within China. Church members reported an uptick in harassment and intimidation.\n \n\n   \n  A fellow Zion pastor asked Jin earlier this month: “What if this is the big thing, that they arrest everyone? What would happen?”\n \n\n   \n  “My dad did not hesitate one moment, and was not scared,” Drexel said. “He just said immediately, ‘Hallelujah, the gospel will spread further.’”\n \n\n   \n    Why now?\n \n\n   \n  The Zion pastors and church leaders arrested in October are now being kept in two detention centers in the southern city of Beihai, according to Drexel.\n \n\n   \n  Though a few have since been released, close to two dozen remain detained, she said.\n \n\n   \n  All the detainees are “innocent Christians,” the church said in a statement on October 12. “Their only ‘offense’ is worshiping God peacefully, preaching the Gospel faithfully, shepherding their flock, and serving their neighbors. These acts of faith are protected under both the Constitution of China and international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t just happen to Zion, said Drexel – other underground churches have been targeted, too, including Bitter Winter and Early Rain Covenant Church.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees’ families are deeply worried, she said. Some are elderly with health problems, while others have young children at home. Her father, Jin, has severe diabetes – and while he’s now being provided generic medication, he hasn’t been able to receive the prescription issued by his doctor, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And in a rare development that Drexel credits to the international attention on their case, most of the detainees have been granted legal representation.\n \n\n   \n  Jin’s lawyer said he appears in “relatively good spirits,” said Drexel – he even joked that the bad food in detention was good for controlling his diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  But the stakes are high under China’s opaque judicial system, which legal observers say has a conviction rate around 99%. Wang Yi, the pastor arrested in 2018, is still in prison today.\n \n\n   \n  Drexel is still trying to understand why the CCP under Xi – whose grip on power has tightened since 2018 – is so threatened by “this small group of Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  One theory, she said, points to China’s ongoing economic hardships. Wary of growing public discontent, the government may “try to clamp down on everything, including freedom of speech and other civil and society organizations,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Fenggang Yang, a professor of sociology and director of the Center on Religion and the Global East at Purdue University, partially agreed. While he’s not convinced it has to do with the current economic situation, he emphasized that the churches pose a deep ideological threat to Xi, who has tightened religious regulations since taking office and increasingly emphasized the need to “Sinicize” religions.\n \n\n   \n  “The Chinese authorities always considered Christianity as one of the institutions that pose the greatest challenge – for (starting a) color revolution, for changing people’s attitudes towards the government,” Yang said.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees don’t seem to be a particularly high priority for either Trump or Xi ahead of their meeting, he added.\n \n\n   \n  As the world watches for signs of easing US-China tensions out of their leaders’ high-stakes talks, Drexel has a much simpler wish: she just wants her dad back.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to emphasize that my dad went back to China because he had a deep love for China and Chinese people,” she said. “We want to be able to keep being faithful to our God, as well as to serve our community and serve China.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/shutdown-talks-thune-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-04:00","title":"Rank-and-file senators engage in ‘shadow negotiation’ in search for shutdown end","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rank-and-file senators from both parties are engaging in secret 'shadow negotiations' to end a 29-day government shutdown, focusing on reopening the government temporarily and securing long-term funding for key programs like food stamps through the USDA.

senators engage in ‘shadow negotiation’ in search for shutdown end \n       \n  By Manu Raju, Sarah Ferris, Ted  Barrett, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:17 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A group of rank-and-file senators increasingly frustrated by the weeks-long stalemate on Capitol Hill believe they have found a possible path to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if it will work.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, this gang of Republicans and Democrats have been engaged in a dual-track negotiation. One of their goals is to resolve the impasse on health care and reopen the government for the next few weeks. They are also hoping to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments, including the US Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps, through next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the private conversations that are going on are trying to create like a shadow negotiation, so that we have some clarity about what we need to vote on,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, one of those involved in the conversations, told CNN on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But these senators still face an uphill climb to get their warring parties on the same page. Their task has been made more complicated by GOP leaders’ fierce commitment not to negotiate with Democrats on health care until Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his members agree to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune appeared to suggest on Wednesday that he would have a conversation with those involved in the negotiations. Asked if he would personally engage with centrist Democrats involved in the talks, Thune told CNN: “I think that will happen pretty soon.”\n \n\n   \n  But his office later told CNN that he remains unwilling to discuss any Obamacare policy changes until the government is open. And Thune stressed he could not guarantee any resolution to Democrats: “I’ve offered up a process. I can’t guarantee an outcome or result,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the emerging talks are a fresh sign of optimism inside a gloomy Capitol building. Finally, after weeks of total gridlock with half of Congress not even present in Washington, there appears to be some movement. The push comes as members of both parties brace for worsening effects of the shutdown, including the lapse of food stamps for the first time in the program’s history starting this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds suggested that — if party leaders agreed — the Senate could vote as early as next week on full-year spending bills that would allow Democrats to move on past the current funding fight and pivot to longer-term spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re focused on - Is there a way for our Democratic colleagues to save face and perhaps not vote directly to a continuing resolution?” Rounds said, referring to the same stopgap bill that Democrats have blocked more than a dozen times. Instead, he said, Republicans would put the bipartisan, full-year spending bills on the floor “as a way around the continuing resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once that’s moving, maybe then we’ll look at a continuing resolution,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers have faced increased pressure to reopen the government this week with  crucial safety net programs  – including federal food assistance for more than 40 million people – at risk of shuttering in the coming days. Thune’s remarks come hours after he and numerous other senators voiced a rare sense of optimism that there could be a way out of the 29-day shutdown. Still, neither side has made any commitments publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ticked up significantly and hopefully that’ll be a precursor of things to come,” Thune told reporters earlier in the day when asked about the status of talks with rank-and-file Democrats. “But yeah, there’s a lot of higher level of conversation.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, Thune said, are not involved in the negotiating. Asked whether he thought there would be enough moderate Democrats in the mix to reach a deal that would reopen the government, he expressed optimism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a possibility that could happen. So, let’s just hope that the conversations continue,” he said, noting he’s “being kept briefed and read-into most of those conversations. I’m hoping something here very soon will be fruitful.”\n \n\n   \n  One Democrat involved in the talks, who requested anonymity to speak on the discussions, told CNN the conversations Thune cited are real. The Democrat would not elaborate on whether they were focused solely on resolving the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies or if other matters – such as the White House’s recent moves to flout Congress’ spending power through “rescissions” – were also involved.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the talks could offer a way out of the shutdown, the Democrat would only say: “Maybe.”\n \n\n   \n  One component of the ongoing talks – how to win support in the Senate for full-year appropriations bills that would prevent another shutdown cliff in the coming weeks. Two other Democrats involved in the discussions suggested to CNN that they are interested in those long-term bills as part of an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about whether emerging talks involved full year spending bills, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters said he didn’t “want to get into specifics but clearly that would be nice.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, told CNN that “it’s accurate to say we’re pushing for full-year appropriations bills because that’s what we should be doing,” when asked whether the party was pursuing them as a way out of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, who has been involved in the talks, declined to confirm Thune’s assessment that they are making progress, but said, “I think there have been good discussions.

truce without peace \n       \n  Analysis by Oren Liebermann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Anyone who looked at the situation in Gaza  on Tuesday  might reasonably have concluded that the ceasefire had collapsed.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli forces in Gaza came under grenade and sniper fire in Rafah, according to the military, killing an Israeli soldier. In retaliation, Israel unleashed punishing strikes across Gaza that killed more than 100 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n \n\n   \n  The US-brokered ceasefire looked like it had disintegrated. But by Wednesday morning, both Hamas and Israel had announced they were once again committed to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  It was the second violent escalation since the  ceasefire  took effect on October 10. But, just like the fighting that occurred nine days later, when two Israeli soldiers and at least 36 Palestinians were killed, it was short, ending within a matter of hours.\n \n\n   \n  Gaza’s new normal seems to be a ceasefire that is both fragile and durable. A truce that holds in general but can vanish in an instant, only to be restored within hours or days.\n \n\n   \n  Until the next escalation.\n \n\n   \n  This situation between all-out conflict and a comprehensive peace provides no closure: Palestinians will be in constant fear of the next wave of deadly strikes, while Israel will teeter perpetually on the brink of war.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week the ceasefire was “not going to be a linear journey.” It would have “ups and downs” and “twists and turns,” he said. Vice President JD Vance said yesterday there would be “little skirmishes here and there.” And yet both were optimistic about the ceasefire holding.\n \n\n   \n  The deal was imposed in large part by the sheer willpower of US President Donald Trump, who reined in Israel, while mediators pressured Hamas to accept. It will take continued US interest to keep the deal intact, especially during the next phase, which requires the creation of an international force for Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas, among other difficult tasks.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire’s fragility is a function of the chasm between what the agreement has so far accomplished and what it has yet to achieve. The fighting has largely stopped. Hamas has turned over the living hostages and more than half of the deceased. Israel has pulled back to the yellow line that demarcates the first withdrawal position inside Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But in the current limbo between the nearly complete first phase of the agreement and the far more difficult second phase, which requires a more complete withdrawal and an end to the war, Israeli forces occupy more than half of Gaza’s territory.\n \n\n   \n  According to Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, that territory includes isolated Hamas cells trapped in tunnels and outside the militant organization’s command and control. With limited resources and no connection to Hamas’ remaining leadership, each cell is “a catastrophe in the making,” Shehada says.\n \n\n   \n  “The closer those IDF vehicles come to a tunnel or to a hideout to those disconnected, isolated militants or the more they run out of food, the higher the chances that they emerge in battle with Israeli soldiers,” Shehada told CNN. “They would rather die in combat than die of starvation or wait for the IDF to find them.”\n \n\n   \n  After the first major violation of the ceasefire on October 19, Hamas issued a statement saying that “contact with the remnants of our groups” in areas like Rafah had “been cut off since the resumption of hostilities in March.” It is these “remnants” that Shehada says are ticking “time bombs.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hamas doesn’t even know how many are there that are still alive,” said Shehada.\n \n\n   \n  Israel and Hamas have engaged in short, sharp escalations many times prior to this war. In 2018 and 2019, the two exchanged fire in rounds of hostilities that would frequently end within 48 hours. But now these escalations are almost exclusively in one direction, with Israel unleashing its firepower on Gaza against a depleted Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire started, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the vast majority during two days of escalation on October 19 and 28. Three Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza during the same period.\n \n\n   \n  Yoav Limor, military and defense analyst for the right-wing Israel Hayom newspaper, says more conflict is inevitable, and it will take US involvement to keep the deal from falling apart.\n \n\n   \n  “Hamas will remain Hamas: it will grow stronger and continue to carry out attacks. Anyone who believes it has changed does not understand the movement or the nature of the region,” said Limor. “That is why Washington must push forward and advance the next phase of the ceasefire deal and work to edge Hamas out of power. Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate.”\n \n\n   \n  The US has sent a parade of its top officials to monitor the ceasefire and begin to create the mechanisms needed for the next phase of the deal, including humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of Gaza. It is a tremendous expense of political capital, but it has signaled to Israel – and to the region – that the White House remains engaged as all the details are still being worked out. The US is determined to keep the process moving forward, even if progress is incremental.\n \n\n   \n  In the short-term, Limor said, “it is likely that the ceasefire will hold this familiar patten of violence and response.” Israel is preparing for an election year during which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be wary of resuming a total war. Hamas is also looking for a  hudna , or period of calm, in which it can recuperate and rebuild, he said.\n \n\n   \n  To break this pattern of a ceasefire marred by violent escalations – and prevent the emerging new normal – requires major progress on some of the 20-point plan’s most difficult conditions, including the disarmament of Hamas and creating new governance in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  At a press conference on Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Hamas was willing to cede power in Gaza, even as he acknowledged that Doha was “trying to push them all in order to get to a point where they acknowledge that they need to disarm.”\n \n\n   \n  He said Hamas needs to be ready to move to the next stage of the deal. “We need to make sure the Palestinians are safe and the Israelis are safe … creating a political horizon for the Palestinian people and creating a Palestinian agency that will be able to be the sole holder of arms.”\n \n\n   \n  If that cannot be done, Israelis and Palestinians will remain in limbo, trapped in a short-term truce without peace that offers no long-term prospect for a solution.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/national-guard-dc-extension-february-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: National Guard Orders in DC Extended Through February 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Guard's deployment in Washington, D.C., originally scheduled to end in November 2025, has been extended through February 2026 by the Trump administration, despite legal challenges from the D.C. attorney general.

\n  National Guard troops  deployed in Washington, DC , will remain mobilized in the city at least through February 2026, according to people familiar with the guard’s orders.\n \n\n   \n  The troops’ orders had been expected to lapse at the end of November before Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth extended them, which has not been previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  The  DC mobilization  is currently the subject of a legal fight between the Trump administration and DC’s attorney general, who has requested that a judge order the removal of the roughly 2,000 troops from DC’s streets.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday morning, there were 2,387 National Guard troops mobilized in DC, including from DC, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama. The pay for those guard members has also been in jeopardy as part of the ongoing government shutdown. The mission is costing roughly $1 million daily.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in August he was mobilizing the guard in DC to help fight crime. The troops are on Title 32 orders, meaning they are authorized to conduct law enforcement activities, as opposed to Title 10 orders which means they are federalized and therefore barred by law to engage in law enforcement activities.\n \n\n   \n  But since they arrived in the city over two months ago, guard members have largely been tasked with “beautification” efforts around the city, including cleaning up parks, laying mulch and picking up trash.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that there was frustration with the mission’s unclear timeline, particularly as troops often leave behind higher-paying civilian jobs while deployed with the guard.\n \n\n   \n  A  previous extension  through November was largely intended to ensure the continuity of benefits for service members and their families, a senior official familiar with the planning previously told CNN. Guard members do not typically qualify for things like health care benefits or housing allowances unless they are on orders for more than 30 days.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration has also left the door open for how long the mission could continue. In August, Vice President JD Vance said if Trump “thinks that he has to extend this order to ensure that people have access to public safety, then that’s exactly what he’ll do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/abby-zwerner-teacher-shooting-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:55:00-04:00","title":"Trial underway in $40 million lawsuit filed by a teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abby Zwerner, a former first-grade teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, is suing former assistant principal Ebony Parker for $40 million after being shot in her classroom by a 6-year-old student on January 1, 2023.

Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest as she sat at a reading table.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the key developments from Day 2 of the trial, which is set to continue Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit accuses former school administrator Ebony Parker of failing to act after four people went to her with  concerns  the student brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s attorney, Diane Toscano, said in opening statements Parker made “bad decisions and choices that day.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker had the authority but failed to search the student, remove him from the classroom and call law enforcement, Toscano added.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting occurred on the first day after the student had returned from a suspension for slamming Zwerner’s phone two days earlier, Toscano said. It sent shock waves through the community and the country, with many wondering  how a child so young could get access to a gun  and shoot his teacher.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner  spent nearly two weeks in the hospital , required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand.\n \n\n   \n  “No one could have imagined that a 6-year old, first-grade student would bring a firearm into a school,” Parker’s attorney, Daniel Hogan, told jurors. “You will be able to judge for yourself whether or not this was foreseeable. That’s the heart of this case.”\n \n\n   \n  Hogan said that decision-making in a public school setting is “cooperative” and “collaborative.” He also warned of hindsight bias and “Monday-morning quarterbacking.”\n \n\n   \n  “The law knows that it is fundamentally unfair to judge another person’s decisions based on stuff that came up after the fact,” Hogan said. “The law requires you to examine people’s decisions at the time they make them.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the district’s superintendent and the school principal.\n \n\n   \n  Parker faces a  separate criminal trial  next month on  eight counts  of felony child neglect — one for “each of the eight bullets that endangered all the students” in Zwerner’s classroom, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Criminal charges against school officials following a school shooting are quite rare, experts say. Each of the counts is punishable by up to five years in prison upon a conviction.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was sentenced to a total of nearly four years in prison for  felony child neglect  and  federal weapons charges .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/kat-abughazaleh-chicago-ice-protests","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"18:55:00Z","title":"Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh indicted over role in ICE protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh has been indicted on felony charges of conspiring to impede a federal agent during protests in suburban Chicago against immigration enforcement operations.

Illinois (AP) — A  Democratic congressional candidate  in Illinois has been accused of blocking a federal agent’s vehicle during September protests outside an immigration enforcement building in suburban Chicago, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.   \n \n\n   \n  The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of  excessive force .\n \n\n   \n  Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by US District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court  blocked the order  before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on September 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.\n \n\n   \n  Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.\n \n\n   \n  Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.\n \n\n   \n  Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on September 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.\n \n\n   \n  A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”\n \n\n   \n  She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring US Rep. Jan Schawkosky.\n \n\n   \n  Protesting the  immigration crackdown around Chicago  has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.\n \n\n   \n  “As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/federal-prosecutors-january-6-mob-of-rioters-taranto","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-04:00","title":"Two federal prosecutors placed on leave after describing January 6 attack as ‘a mob of rioters’ in court document","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, were placed on leave after a sentencing memo for Taylor Taranto described the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack as a 'mob of rioters'.

were placed on leave after describing the January 6, 2021   attack at the US Capitol as stemming from a “mob of rioters”  in a sentencing memo  Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The two prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, were notified of their suspension hours after they submitted a sentencing request for Taylor Taranto, the person said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump pardoned Taranto for charges related to his participation in January 6, but the Washington man still faces gun charges stemming from his arrest in the summer of 2023, when he was  detained nearby President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, home .\n \n\n   \n  When describing Taranto’s history, prosecutors wrote that, “On January 6, 2021, thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol while a joint session of Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.”\n \n\n   \n  The original sentencing memo, dated Tuesday, was removed from the court docket Wednesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  A  new sentencing memo  was posted by different prosecutors late Wednesday that removed all references to January 6 or the Trump social media post that Taranto reposted, which included an alleged address for President Barack Obama, where Taranto was arrested the next day.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  They asked the judge to sentence him to 27 months behind bars. That same punishment is still being requested by prosecutors in the new memo.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June, 2023 in Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and other’s homes.\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia and White wrote in Tuesday’s memo that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by a federal judge of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  The move to place federal prosecutors on leave follows a list of other firings in US Attorney’s offices.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration fired the top national security prosecutor in the nearby US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia,  Michael Ben’Ary,  earlier this month after a social media post by a  right-wing activist and writer falsely tied  him to  the case of FBI Director James Comey .\n \n\n   \n  The former US Attorney of the same Eastern District, Erik Siebert, resigned in September after mounting pressure to bring charges against  New York Attorney General Letitia James , and was replaced by a White House advisor who lacked prosecutorial experience.\n \n\n   \n  Another prosecutor in the Alexandria, Beth Yusi, was  dismissed earlier this month  after drafting a memo outlining why prosecutors believed there was not enough evidence to bring charges against James.

Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s no secret at this point that congressional Republicans are loathe to vote against President Donald Trump. Fealty to Trump has become the animating principle in the party – so much so that GOP lawmakers have willfully relegated themselves to second-class citizens in Washington as they’ve steadily ceded their powers and prerogatives to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But all of that makes it even more striking when they decide to actually stand up for themselves, for once.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s now happened twice just this week.\n \n\n   \n  Enough Senate Republicans voted against Trump’s tariffs on Brazil and Canada so that a majority of the chamber has now expressed its opposition to both. They did so even after the White House  mobilized Vice President JD Vance  to try to prevent the rebukes.\n \n\n   \n  So when have Republicans in Congress actually been willing to vote against Trump? It’s most often happened with foreign policy.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s run through the big examples.\n \n\n   \n    The tariffs\n \n\n   \n  These were not large-scale GOP defections, but they were large enough that they enabled the  GOP-controlled chamber to rebuke the president.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, four GOP senators – Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – voted to terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration to impose tariffs on Canada. That meant the measure passed with 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined them to  make it five Republicans voting against Trump’s tariffs on Brazil . The overall vote was 52-48, against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  (Tillis has raised concerns about Trump’s tariffs before. He said he voted against the Brazil tariffs, specifically, because they appeared to be related to Brazil’s prosecution of Trump-allied former President Jair Bolsonaro rather than actual trade disputes.)\n \n\n   \n  Then on Wednesday, the same four GOP senators voted against the Canada tariffs again.\n \n\n   \n  It’s highly unlikely the House will ever vote on terminating these tariffs. In fact, the GOP-controlled House actually took action earlier this year  to prevent such votes . And these senators could go much further if they wanted to in trying to force the issue.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s significant that a majority of the GOP-controlled Senate is rebuking Trump on his tariffs, and it certainly undercuts his supposed mandate on the issue.\n \n\n   \n    2017: The Russia sanctions\n \n\n   \n  This was perhaps the first big congressional rebuke of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  During the early portions of the Russia investigation, Congress  passed new sanctions against Russia  that the Trump White House explicitly opposed. The legislation  also gave Congress additional powers to block Trump from easing existing Russia sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The measure passed almost unanimously in both GOP-controlled chambers – 98-2 in the Senate and 419-3 in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ultimately signed the legislation – likely knowing Congress could simply override his veto – while claiming it contained “a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.”\n \n\n   \n    2018: Ending US involvement in Yemen\n \n\n   \n  The Senate  voted 56-41  in late 2018 to end US support for the Saudi Arabia-led war in Yemen. The move came shortly after Trump signaled a solid relationship with the Saudis despite their murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Seven Senate Republicans voted in favor.\n \n\n   \n    2019: No NATO withdrawal\n \n\n   \n  With Trump occasionally flirting with a withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in his first term, the Democratic-controlled House in early 2019 passed legislation to make that more difficult.\n \n\n   \n  It  voted 357-22  to prohibit funds from being used to withdraw from the alliance.\n \n\n   \n    2019: The Syria rebukes\n \n\n   \n  Few Trump moves have alienated congressional Republicans likes the ones he made in Syria in 2019. And they led to separate rebukes in both the Senate and the House.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump moved to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan, the GOP-controlled Senate passed nonbinding amendments expressing its opposition. One amendment stated that the move “could allow terrorists to regroup, destabilize critical regions, and create vacuums that could be filled by Iran or Russia to the detriment of United States interests and our allies.”\n \n\n   \n  It passed 68-23. A similar amendment later passed 70-26, with 43 Senate Republicans voting in favor.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, then the second-ranking Senate Republican, said lawmakers felt the need to vote that way after the White House disregarded their privately expressed concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the year, Trump’s controversial decision to withdraw from northeast Syria led many Republicans to rebuke him for effectively allowing Turkey to slaughter US-allied Kurdish forces there.\n \n\n   \n  The Democrat-led House  voted 354-60  for a resolution stating that the withdrawal was “beneficial to adversaries of the United States government, including Syria, Iran, and Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  House Republicans voted for it more than 2-to-1, with 129 votes in favor and 60 against.\n \n\n   \n    2019: Other Middle East rebukes\n \n\n   \n  Congress also rebuked Trump’s posture  on other Middle East issues , including arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  That legislation passed in both chambers with the support of 16 House Republicans and seven Senate Republicans, before  Trump ultimately vetoed it .\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s Jan. 6 impeachment\n \n\n   \n  It seems like a long time ago now, and the votes came at a time when many Republicans probably thought Trump’s political career was over.\n \n\n   \n  But the votes to impeach and convict Trump after January 6, 2021, remain some of the most historic bipartisan rebukes of a president ever.\n \n\n   \n  The 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach made that the  most bipartisan impeachment vote ever . And the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict was by far the  most members of a president’s party to ever vote that way .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/economy/fed-october-rate-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00Z","title":"Fed Chair Powell Says Don’t Count on a December Rate Cut","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to a range of 3.75% to 4.00% on October 29, 2025, for the second time in the year, in response to a weakening job market and weak hiring trends.

October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Federal Reserve on Wednesday  lowered interest rates  for the second time this year in a continued bid to prevent unemployment from surging.\n \n\n   \n  But another rate cut at the next meeting in December “is not a forgone conclusion,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference, adding there were “strongly differing views” among policymakers on how to move forward.\n \n\n   \n  Fed officials voted for another quarter-point rate cut, lowering their benchmark lending rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in three years.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s decision drew two dissents; one from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who backed a larger, half-point cut; and another from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.\n \n\n   \n  It is the first time since 2019 that there were dueling dissents — both calling for easier and tighter policy — underscoring the heated debate among officials over how President Donald Trump’s sweeping policies on trade, immigration and spending are affecting the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  To make matters more complicated, it was also the first time officials have set monetary policy while lacking an entire month of crucial government employment figures in the modern era.\n \n\n   \n  Central bankers began to lower rates last month after data through August showed employers were adding jobs at the weakest pace since 2010. Major companies such as Amazon and Target have recently announced tens of thousands of layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The problem: A prolonged government shutdown could stand in the way of further rate cuts, especially with some officials such as Schmid concerned about persistent inflation pressures in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n    Powell on the Fed flying blind\n \n\n   \n  Powell made it clear that the Fed doesn’t have the full picture of the economy’s health without government data.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s latest policy statement noted that “more recent indicators” were “consistent” with earlier data, before the shutdown, that showed weak hiring and slightly higher unemployment.  Powell said as much when taking reporters’ questions.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s just no story over the last four weeks, it’s kind of stable,” he said. “You don’t see anything that says that the job market, or really any part of the economy, is making a significant deterioration.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from payroll software provider ADP released this week showed that hiring picked up in September, but remained weak. And while there have been prominent layoff announcements in recent weeks, that doesn’t immediately translate to higher unemployment. Workers who’ve been laid off sometimes receive generous severance packages.\n \n\n   \n  Powell mentioned that private data cannot replace government figures, which are widely known as the “gold standard” of measuring the world’s largest economy. And the persistent absence of those figures could put future rate cuts at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n    Powell on the lingering question of tariff inflation\n \n\n   \n  The inflation situation also remains murky, Powell said.\n \n\n   \n  So far, inflation hasn’t surged due to new tariffs that have gone into effect, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, largely thanks to businesses managing higher costs without passing the buck to consumers.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed chief said that officials expect “that there will be some additional increased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the production chain and, finally, get to consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  Economists widely expect tariff inflation to pick up as well, especially if Trump makes good on his recent tariff threats.\n \n\n   \n  The September CPI, which was released last week despite the shutdown, for Social Security’s cost-of-living adjustment, was cooler than economists had predicted, but it showed persistent price pressures that could worsen because of Trump’s tariffs. Trump is meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping late Wednesday US time for a wide-ranging discussion in South Korea, which will likely include a potential US-China trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  Powell reiterated that there’s a “reasonable” expectation that tariff inflation may be short lived, which helped pave the way for September’s rate cut. But that would also remain unclear if the October CPI, which is scheduled for November 13, isn’t released because the shutdown persisted. Fed officials normally look to the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, widely known as their preferred inflation measure, but that figure also hasn’t been released due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Powell said once the tariffs have kicked in, the hope is that “they stop generating inflation,” reflecting a one-off effect.\n \n\n   \n  “This is how we believe and hope that it will work out,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate decision, policymakers announced the end of a three-year process to shrink the size of their enormous portfolio by December 1.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s portfolio, or balance sheet, reached about $9 trillion in mid-2022, but is now around $6.6 trillion after a careful effort to reverse the stimulus it introduced into the economy during the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s a tool that works in the background while the Fed’s key interest rate does much of the heavy lifting to achieve its macroeconomic goals. Officials have judged that the balance sheet is close to a more normal state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/health/fda-drug-costs-biosimilars","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:53:00Z","title":"FDA to streamline approvals for generic biological drugs in latest move targeting health costs","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new draft guidance to streamline the development and approval of biosimilar biological drugs, reducing reliance on expensive and lengthy clinical trials by allowing analytical testing to demonstrate similarity to reference products.

drugs in latest move targeting health costs \n       \n  By Deidre McPhillips, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:53 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Food and Drug Administration will take steps to streamline the development of generic versions of complex biological drugs, the agency announced Wednesday. The changes are meant to accelerate approvals of cheaper alternatives to medications that treat a wide range of illnesses, leading to increased market competition and lower drug costs for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Biologic drugs are developed using living sources such as bacteria, yeast and animal cells, which inherently creates  more variation  and makes manufacturing more complex than for chemically derived drugs. Biologics have a special pathway to FDA approval, and  biosimilars  — alternatives to the brand name products — have long been treated differently than other generic drugs.\n \n\n   \n  As part of Wednesday’s announcement, the FDA released new  draft guidance  that proposes allowing companies to scale back on the studies and trials needed to prove that a biosimilar product is similar enough to an existing FDA-approved product.\n \n\n   \n  “Biosimilars are often far more affordable to patients and have the promise to significantly lower health care costs in America,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a statement. “By streamlining the biosimilar development process and helping advance interchangeability, we can achieve massive cost reductions for advanced treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and rare disorders affecting millions of Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Biologic medications account for just 5% of prescriptions in the US but more than half of total drug spending, according to the FDA. The agency has  approved only 76 biosimilars  as of early October, it says, and only about 1 in 10 biologic drugs that will lose patent protection in the next decade currently has a biosimilar in development.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed changes will help drug companies cut the time needed to bring a biosimilar to market in half and can slash development costs by $100 million, Makary said at a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “The fastest-growing area of health care spending in the United States is drug spending, and the fastest area of drug spending increases is with this new class of medicines called biologics,” he said. “Lower prices for drug development means lower R&D costs and lower drug prices for everyday Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  The first biosimilar approval in the US happened in 2015. In analyzing data from the decade since, the FDA says that clinical efficacy studies that directly compare a biosimilar to its reference product to confirm that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy “add little scientific value compared with analytical testing.”\n \n\n   \n  The new guidance “reduces this unnecessary resource-intensive requirement for developers to conduct comparative human clinical studies,” which can take years and cost tens of millions of dollars, the agency said. Instead, it allows drug developers “to rely instead on analytical testing to demonstrate product differences.”\n \n\n   \n  Humira is an injectable biologic drug used to treat several autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, and has been one of the top-selling medications since it was approved by the FDA in 2002. Ten biosimilars for Humira have been approved since 2016, but the first one just became available in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “The fundamental problem in health care is that we have non-competitive markets,” Makary said. “When you have that gap, it allows a longer period of no competition. So we want to see more competition, and we want to see more innovation.”\n \n\n   \n  In June, Truveta Research analyzed prescription trends for nearly 67,000 people taking Humira. It found that between January 2023 and April 2025, about 13% of them had evidence of switching to a biosimilar. But among those who switched, about 13% had evidence of switching back to Humira.\n \n\n   \n  “This means for every 100 people on bio-originator Humira, 13 switched to a biosimilar, and 2 switched to a biosimilar and then switched back to bio-originator Humira,” Truveta wrote in a  research blog post. \n \n\n   \n  The switch to biosimilars “may reflect changes in insurer policies, growing trust among providers and patients in biosimilars, or broader shifts in the drug market,” Truveta researchers wrote, but “initial switches may not always be sustained despite lower cost.”\n \n\n   \n  “Notably, nearly 40% of patients who returned to bio-originator Humira did so within 30 days of initiating a biosimilar, suggesting early dissatisfaction [or] adverse reactions. Given that many patients switched back before completing a typical Humira dispense, this pattern may also reflect fear or uncertainty about switching to a biosimilar,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Biosimilars are not exact copies of reference drugs like other generic drugs, and there’s an added layer of approval needed for a biosimilar to be considered “interchangeable” — a classification that allows pharmacists to substitute it without consulting a prescriber.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said Wednesday that it also plans to remove regulatory barriers — generally recommending against “switching studies” — required for biosimilars to receive this classification.\n \n\n   \n  “Science continues to evolve, and the FDA remains committed to advancing common-sense policies that further promote efficient and effective biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar development, without compromising safety and effectiveness,” Dr. George Tidmarsh, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA’s new guidance for biosimilars could start to make an impact quickly, said John Murphy, president and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group for generic and biosimilar drugmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you will start to see clinical development and investment capital allocation decisions happen fairly quickly,” he said. Drug development will still take time, but there could be meaningful signals of change in pipeline strategies made within the next three to six months.\n \n\n   \n  Lower costs for biosimilar development could also encourage drugmakers to broaden their scope to include biologic products with smaller patient markets, Murphy said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, experts say there are additional challenges to ensure that insurance plans and other health care economics allow for investment into biosimilars and create competition as intended.\n \n\n   \n  “We welcome the administration’s focus on increasing biosimilar access and affordability,” Alex Schriver, senior vice president of public affairs for PhRMA, a trade group representing pharmaceutical companies, said in a statement. “Policymakers must fix the misaligned incentives and business practices by middlemen who block biosimilars and profit off medicines at the expense of patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement is among several steps by the Trump administration to lower drug costs, including an executive order calling for drugmakers to offer drugs to US patients with the lowest, or “ Most Favored Nation ,” price and the creation of a “ TrumpRx ” direct-to-consumer website for certain drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said in a  fact sheet  that costly drugs can lead to people skipping doses and abandoning treatment, and many people face insurance coverage gaps and high deductibles.\n \n\n   \n  “With today’s action, the FDA aims to help more companies bring affordable, high-quality biosimilars to market and reduce costs for the American people,” the agency said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/entertainment/snl-kevin-nealon-claustrophobia-makeup","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:50:00Z","title":"Kevin Nealon says he developed claustrophobia after being fitted for a fake chin to play Jay Leno on 'SNL'","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin Nealon, a former 'Saturday Night Live' cast member from 1986 to 1995, revealed on the 'Where Everybody Knows Your Name' podcast with Ted Danson on SiriusXM that the process of being fitted with a fake chin to imitate Jay Leno caused him significant physical and psychological distress.

Taylor is the coauthor of a new study published Wednesday in the journal  Frontiers  about what the expedition uncovered.\n \n\n   \n  Despite not finding the wreckage, the expedition captured invaluable underwater footage of marine life that inhabits the frigid depths of the Weddell Sea. The research vessel’s remotely operated underwater vehicle, nicknamed Lassie, spied a series of nests arranged in distinct shapes sprawling across the seafloor.\n \n\n   \n  “Over a thousand maintained nests within the areas studied goes to show that exploration of our world is still underway, with constant new findings,” lead study author Russ Connelly, postgraduate researcher in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Essex, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The discovery  showcases the diversity of life that exists in a place experiencing rapid climate change — which is why scientists are petitioning for the Weddell Sea’s fragile ecosystem to be protected by law.\n \n\n   \n  (The HMS Endurance shipwreck was ultimately  discovered during a 2022 expedition .)\n \n\n   \n    A geometric neighborhood\n \n\n   \n  As Lassie passed over the Weddell seafloor, large dimples appeared in the sand. The round spots seemed neat compared with their surroundings, clear of the layers of decomposing plankton spotted elsewhere on the seafloor.\n \n\n   \n  “This was the first time we have seen this area of seafloor, so there is always a realm of mystery to be expected,” Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  When scientists looked at the video footage that Lassie took, they noticed fish and fish larvae within the dimples. A closer look revealed the fish to be a species of rockcod called Lindbergichthys nudifrons, otherwise known as the yellowfin notie. The fish are found from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia in the Atlantic section of the  Southern Ocean , Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  “These species are extremophiles; they thrive in high-pressure and cold-water environments,” Connelly said. “They build small, circular nests in the fine sediment, and then the males guard the eggs for around 4 months. Their main threat comes from predators on the seafloor, like brittle stars and predatory worms, which try to eat the eggs.”\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also noticed that the 1,036 active nests, located across five sites on the seafloor, showcased six different patterns.\n \n\n   \n  There were clusters of nests  found close together or overlapping, and crescents of nests arranged in a curved line, like a crescent moon. Other nests were evenly spaced in a straight line, arranged in an oval shape with even spacing around the perimeter or following a distinct U-shape.\n \n\n   \n  There were also individual, isolated nests, which were typically larger than any that were arranged in a specific shape, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The finding marks the first time that complex patterns have been observed in yellowfin notie nests.\n \n\n   \n  Clusters were the most common arrangement, representing more than 42% of the nests, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  The team believes the patterns represent a strategy for survival against predators. For those living in cluster patterns, the fish at the center receive the most protection from predators. The researchers think this arrangement represents the  “selfish herd” theory , “where individuals reduce their domain of danger by putting other individuals between themselves and an approaching predator,” the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  Previous research has shown that yellowfin notie males will defend territories up to 9.8 inches (25 centimeters) away from their nests, which would mean their neighbors are also protected within the cluster arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  “In the absence of refuge, they can group together to form greater levels of protection,” Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  The fish are likely protecting against ribbon worms, or Parborlasia corrugata, a type of nemertean, observed living in the vicinity. The ribbon worms detect chemical signals from their environment to find food.\n \n\n   \n  “(The clusters) could create a confusing sensory environment for the nemertean, making it more difficult to detect and target a single nest, a crucial adaptive strategy during the long incubation period (for the eggs),” the authors wrote in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the isolated nests on the outskirts of the fish communities are thought to belong to larger, stronger members of the species capable of defending their own nests.\n \n\n   \n    Protecting a vulnerable place\n \n\n   \n  The ice-covered Weddell Sea is a challenging place to study, but it’s home to a diverse community of fish, brittle stars, sponges, cephalopods, marine birds and mammals.\n \n\n   \n  Another expedition to the Weddell Sea in 2021 observed a vast colony of icefish, or Neopagetopsis ionah, with  see-through skulls and transparent blood .\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Autun Purser, a senior researcher in deep-sea ecology and technology at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, led the 2021 icefish research. While he did not participate in the new research, Purser said he believes both studies benefited from underwater camera systems that can spot patterns within extensive fish nests.\n \n\n   \n  “With mobile camera systems, we can now investigate larger structures and areas of seafloor in studies than was possible in the past,” Purser said.\n \n\n   \n  Return trips to the Weddell Sea have confirmed that such nesting behaviors are more abundant within the icy ecosystem, he added.\n \n\n   \n  He also said he suspects that species within the environment, such as the icefish and the yellowfin notie, benefit from rocks dropped by icebergs as they drift and melt. In the new study, the authors noted that 14.9% of the active nests had pebbles within or around them.\n \n\n   \n  “(The rocks) are ideal to lay eggs on as they allow good oxygenation of the eggs, helping to prevent rotting on the seafloor, whilst also providing a barrier to animals living within the muds to eating the eggs,” Purser noted. “The soft sediments make a ridge wall around these eggs, furthering defense. … It is just an idea, but I like it.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors believe the new research provides crucial evidence of breeding habitats that strengthens the idea of the  Weddell Sea Marine Protected Area , proposed by the  Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources .\n \n\n   \n  “If successfully designated as (a marine protected area), it would mean these vulnerable marine ecosystems are protected,” Connelly said. “It is incredibly important to explore and study these unique environments before we lose something we never knew we had.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/morocco-charged-over-2400-gen-z-protests-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:45:00Z","title":"Morocco Charges Over 2,400 People Over Gen Z Protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Morocco has launched a sweeping crackdown, charging over 2,480 people in connection with youth-led Gen Z 212 protests that began over grievances about government spending on events and neglect of public services.

Instead, the justices appear to be debating one of the administration’s more nuanced justifications for the deployment.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we can’t know for sure, the order certainly seems like a bad sign for President Trump,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “There would be no need for the Supreme Court to ask the parties to address this question if five justices had already agreed to vote for the federal government on one of the other two possible grounds.”\n \n\n   \n  The order comes as multiple courts have been reviewing deployments to other cities – most notably, Portland, Oregon. In that case, the full 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said this week that it will re-review a decision in Trump’s favor.\n \n\n   \n  The call for additional written arguments is almost certainly a response to a  brief submitted  in the case by a Georgetown University Law Center professor, Martin Lederman, who suggested the law Trump is relying on to deploy the Guard to the Chicago area doesn’t apply to civilian law enforcement agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Rather, Lederman argued, the National Guard can only be called forth under that law to augment regular military forces. In its order Wednesday, the Supreme Court asked the Department of Justice and officials in Illinois to address that very issue in a series of new briefs due through mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has argued that calling up the guard is necessary to confront protesters at an ICE facility outside Chicago that he has claimed are engaged in “coordinated, violent opposition to the enforcement of federal law.” He has relied on a federal law that allows a president to take that action if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the litigation, Trump has argued that the protestors are impeding ICE operations. Therefore, he has claimed, ICE has been unable to execute federal immigration laws.\n \n\n   \n  But Lederman dropped a new twist into the case with a brief earlier this month: When the law refers to “regular forces,” he said, it meant the regular military, not civilian law enforcement agencies like ICE.\n \n\n   \n  “There can hardly be any question that the term ‘the regular forces’ in the 1908 Act…referred to the standing, professional military forces, who were commonly known as ‘Regulars,’” Lederman wrote. “The effect of the law was to prescribe the National Guard as the ‘second line of defense, as a supplement to the regular army.’”\n \n\n   \n  Now, both the Trump administration and local officials in Illinois will file a series of briefs debating that issue.\n \n\n   \n  In the Chicago case, Trump federalized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard earlier this month to “protect officers and federal property” outside of Chicago. Another 400 federalized members of the Texas National Guard were also deployed to the state. The administration said those guard members would serve “solely in a protective capacity” and would not engage in law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812.\n \n\n   \n   The Supreme Court rejected Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/safety-net-programs-at-risk-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:39:00Z","title":"These four crucial safety net programs are in danger as the government shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the federal government shutdown continues from October 1, 2025, four major social safety net programs—SNAP (food stamps), Head Start, LIHEAP (energy assistance), and WIC—are at severe risk of funding cuts.

Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:39 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The clock is ticking for four major social safety net programs that keep tens of millions of struggling Americans — including millions of children and senior citizens — fed and warm, as well as provide early education services.\n \n\n   \n  The  government shutdown , which began October 1, has put in jeopardy these federal lifelines as their available funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the gravity of the situation has yet to push Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill closer to an agreement on a government spending package for fiscal year 2026 that would end the shutdown. The two sides  continue to throw barbs  at one another, while a growing number of their constituents panic over losing their much-needed federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    Food stamps\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture says it does not have the money to provide  food stamps  to nearly 42 million Americans next month amid the government shutdown. If the benefits are indeed halted, it would be the first time such a stoppage has taken place.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, is expected to provide about $8 billion in assistance in November. The agency has a contingency fund, which contains between $5 billion and $6 billion, but Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins maintains that it cannot be used to cover next month’s benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and advocates disagree, arguing that the money should be shifted to fund November’s benefits. A coalition of 25 Democratic-run states  sued  the Trump administration on Tuesday, claiming that the agency cannot suspend benefits indefinitely and refuse to spend available funds to provide assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Some states are allocating more money for emergency nutrition assistance to their residents in need, while Virginia is setting up an alternative food benefit program. But in most cases, the efforts only cover a small fraction of the missed payments.\n \n\n   \n  The potential pause in food stamp benefits has also put a lot of pressure on food banks and pantries, which are already stretched thin from rising prices and increased need.\n \n\n   \n    Head Start\n \n\n   \n  Starting on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families are at risk of losing access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households, according to the National Head Start Association.\n \n\n   \n  Some 140 programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will miss their federal funding, which was set to be paid either on October 1 or November 1, if the government shutdown continues.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, there are about 1,600 Head Start programs in the US, but they obtain federal grants at different times of the year so most are not yet affected by the shutdown. They serve a total of a little more than 750,000 children and receive just over $12 billion in funding annually.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the programs that haven’t received their federal funds could have to temporarily close their doors, said Tommy Sheridan, the association’s deputy director. But others — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n    Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program\n \n\n   \n  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start. The aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  Most states are continuing to take applications, though they are warning residents that the grants are paused until the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  Those most at risk are people in cold weather states who heat their homes with heating oil or propane, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That’s because a lot of states have rules that prevent electric and natural gas companies from cutting off service to delinquent customers during the winter, but those protections don’t apply to firms that deliver fuel.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Wolfe expects many states to try to use their own funds to help any vulnerable households until the LIHEAP grants are processed, though he is concerned that states could be tapped out since they may also have to provide more emergency food aid during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, even when the government reopens, it’s expected to take weeks for the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute the LIHEAP funds to states. And the process could take even longer this year since  HHS laid off its LIHEAP team  during its major reorganization in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  LIHEAP received about $4 billion in funding in the last fiscal year. Similar appropriations were working their way through Congress before the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Once the government reopens, the Administration for Children and Families, a division of HHS, will “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” an HHS spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    WIC\n \n\n   \n  WIC continued operating in October thanks to a  $300 million infusion  from the Trump administration, which tapped leftover tariff revenue that typically supports child nutrition programs.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children depend on WIC, formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.\n \n\n   \n  But whether it can provide benefits for November is unclear. The USDA told CNN on Monday that it would use tariff revenue to support WIC for the  “foreseeable future.”  But the National WIC Association told CNN on Wednesday that state agencies have not been informed of additional federal support.\n \n\n   \n  Some state agencies have announced they have enough money to keep their programs operating into November.\n \n\n   \n  Washington’s Department of Health said it can maintain food benefits and a reduced administrative team through mid- to late-November, for instance. In New Hampshire, food benefits will continue at least until November 7, but WIC services may end at several locations on Saturday if the shutdown continues.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/xi-trump-meeting-farmers-bailout","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00Z","title":"'All will be forgiven': Farmers and lawmakers eye Trump-Xi meeting with a bailout hanging in the balance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of a government shutdown, the U.S. is grappling with whether to implement a $10–$14 billion farm bailout for farmers devastated by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and China’s halt in buying U.S. soybeans since May.

Owermohle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:39 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins burst into the White House last week explaining that her team had found a legal way to help unlock billions in relief funds for US  farmers caught up  in the trade war with China, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  By tapping into a Depression-era fund and moving around leftover money from the prior fiscal year, Rollins was able to scrounge together enough funding to reopen all 2,100 USDA county offices by paying two employees per office to come back to work. Only then could they get the crucial assistance funds out the door, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “We had to pay the employees in order to bring them back. We had to find the money,” a USDA official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The maneuver unlocked more than $3 billion in emergency aid and regular program assistance that had already been approved by Congress, money that will be used for things like crop insurance and disaster assistance made to farmers across the country.\n \n\n   \n  But while the agency was able to get that money out the door, it’s unclear whether farmers will also be helped with a much larger relief package.\n \n\n   \n  Trump officials have debated for months whether to move forward with a  bailout package to help farmers  who have been hit by President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. Discussions have centered on a package of $10 billion to $14 billion, if not higher.\n \n\n   \n  But the  government shutdown  complicated things, raising questions over whether a farm bailout will materialize at all.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown has totally affected this whole process because a lot of the people who were charged with deciding this are furloughed,” a White House official told CNN. “Now the administration, through Treasury and Ag, are reassessing its options.”\n \n\n   \n  The president has also not yet decided on how he would like to proceed, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tariffs prompted China to stop buying US soybeans in May, leaving farmers across the country sitting on billions in unsold crops and some questioning the policies of a president many of them voted for.\n \n\n   \n  Dave Murphy, founder of United We Eat, a farmer advocacy group aligned with Robert F. Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement, said that Trump’s decision to bail out Argentina has soured farmers even more.\n \n\n   \n  “There are farmers that are livid, that have voted for Trump three times,” Murphy told CNN. “If the Trump administration is promising $20 billion, perhaps $40 (billion) for Argentina, he can’t leave farmers behind on this, which is an entirely administration-created nightmare, right, because of the tariffs.”\n \n\n   \n  Now some Trump officials are hoping that a bigger bailout may not be necessary if the president’s sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping results in a deal to lower tariffs and loosen up the trade war. \n \n\n   \n  “We hope we don’t have to use (a bailout). We want China to buy the soybeans, so maybe we don’t have to do a program,” the USDA official said.\n \n\n   \n  In advance of the meeting, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced  a framework agreement  that could prompt Beijing to start buying “a substantial amount” of US soybeans again. China purchased roughly half of US soybean exports last year, according to USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, ahead of the Trump-Xi talks, Rollins  said on X  that China had made its first soybean purchase since May, a sign that the impasse could be easing.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in major farming states have been frustrated by Trump’s whiplash on tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “If he can actually pull off a big trade deal with China that involves the sale of soybeans, all will be forgiven,” Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters Monday, while adding  that he was “exasperated”  by Trump’s latest missive  ending trade talks with and increasing tariffs  on Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The lingering farm bailout is just one of the issues facing Rollins as she navigates the fallout from Trump’s tariffs and the government shutdown. She’s still dealing with the backlash from Trump’s jab at American beef producers last week and the president’s  call to buy Argentinian beef  — after already  bailing out the country itself  with $20 billion.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a group of Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration after the Agriculture Department said  it could not legally pay  $8 billion in food stamp benefits for November with the government shut down.\n \n\n   \n    A candid text message\n \n\n   \n  Soybeans have been the largest US agricultural export, valued at more than $24 billion in 2024, according to USDA data. China purchased about half of those exports last year but has not bought any US soybeans since May.\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself has gotten involved in the discussions over how to best help the struggling soybean industry, in part because Rollins has forced the issue not only with him, but also with Bessent.\n \n\n   \n  A viral  photo of Bessent’s phone captured by the Associated Press  last month showed a text on Bessent’s phone from a contact named “BR,” presumed to be Rollins. Her messages illustrated the deep concerns within the Trump administration over the soybean industry’s woes. It came as the Treasury Department was preparing to send Argentina a $20 billion lifeline — something that  farmers had criticized  as money that should be flowing to them.\n \n\n   \n  “This gives China more leverage on us,” the message said, because Argentina lowered its prices to sell soybeans to China.\n \n\n   \n  Rollins told reporters at the White House earlier this month that she is in “constant communication” with the White House and partners across the government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been blaming China for the pain US soybean farmers are facing, while floating tariff revenue as a way to pay for a bailout. But as a potential meeting with Xi grew closer in recent days, he became more optimistic about coming to an agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ll make a deal,” Trump said in the Oval Office last week, saying he thought an agreement was possible on China’s rare earth materials as well as on soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  Rollins and Bessent work closely on a series of issues because of the nature of their portfolios. When it comes to the farmer bailout, however, their competing interests have at times led them to clash, two White House officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Brooke is solely concerned about farmers and ranchers. Bessent is more concerned about consumers,” one of the officials said.\n \n\n   \n    Shutdown puts bailout plans on hold\n \n\n   \n  White House officials said that a farmer bailout likely would have been announced by now if not for the government shutdown. One official argued the shutdown has not only delayed a relief package, but also changed which mechanism the administration might use to offer aid.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the shutdown, administration officials said, a larger bailout package had been all but decided on. The plan was to use revenues generated from Trump’s tariff policies, as well as money from a little-known USDA fund, to pay for it. However, several of the federal employees tasked with planning and executing the bailout were furloughed during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Administration and congressional sources said that the mechanism for a farm bailout could depend on the size of the package. It’s possible that funds could be tapped through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era program that allows the government to help make up losses for farmers.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration also might need Congress to sign off on directing tariff money toward specific programs or to approve bailout funds in a spending bill.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re just really not sure what approach Congress and the administration are taking,” said Lesly Weber McNitt, president of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown makes it harder to have those conversations. “There are a lot of people who are involved in this type of program construction and implementation who are furloughed,” McNitt said. “It’s just really murky right now.”\n \n\n   \n  USDA earlier this month rejected a bipartisan request to brief the House and Senate Agriculture committees on the shutdown, opting instead to brief only Republican members, according to two congressional staffers. Staffers were hopeful that potential relief programs would be discussed in the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Joe Glauber, a former chief economist at USDA in the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said it’s always a challenge to strike a balance of designing assistance packages that help different types of farmers in an equitable way, so that one crop like soybeans doesn’t get more than another.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s still very fluid here,” said Glauber, now a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. “One thing I learned about any farm bailout or farm payments in general — it’s very hard to get them back.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A triple whammy’ hitting farmers\n \n\n   \n  Farm associations have been hesitant to assign a dollar figure to how much relief the industry needs. Some figures floated in congressional discussions have included $20 billion to $30 billion for growers of major commodity crops, such as soybeans, corn and wheat. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has discussed a package in the  $10 billion to $14 billion range .\n \n\n   \n  Not even the higher estimates of aid, if approved, would recoup losses. The growers of nine of the biggest row crops were already projected to lose up to $45 billion this year because of soaring production costs and low crop prices, according to Shawn Arita, an economist at North Dakota State University’s Agricultural Risk Policy Center.\n \n\n   \n  Now there is “a triple whammy” of production costs, low prices, and the trade conflict, which goes well beyond the soybean tussle with China, Arita said.\n \n\n   \n  Many farmers who grow both crops planted more corn this season, resulting in a record 16.8 billion bushels of corn this year.\n \n\n   \n  That is roughly 2 billion extra bushels with no buyers.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to be a major pile of corn with nowhere to go, and that depresses prices,” said McNitt.\n \n\n   \n  Many farmers say they’d rather sell their crops than receive bailouts but argue that it would make sense to use tariff money to help those impacted.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t take money out of the budget. … The tariffs cause some more issues. But why not use the tariff revenues to help get us through this time?” said Bob Worth, a former president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association.\n \n\n   \n  “We were putting all our eggs in one basket, and that basket was China,” added Worth, who has been farming more than five decades. “And China does what China wants to do. You can’t stop it.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s René Marsh and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/entertainment/elijah-wood-lord-of-the-rings-set-wedding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:37:00-04:00","title":"Elijah Wood Returns to Hobbiton Movie Set and Surprises Wedding Couple","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elijah Wood, the acclaimed actor who portrayed Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s 'The Lord of the Rings' film trilogy, unexpectedly appeared at a Middle-earth-themed wedding taking place on the Hobbiton movie set in New Zealand’s Waikato region.

By the time Hurricane Melissa roared ashore Tuesday, that uber-warm Caribbean Sea had helped turn it into a monster: a Category 5 storm with winds reaching 185 miles an hour,  tied for the strongest hurricane  to strike land in the Atlantic.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say it’s a visceral example of what climate change can do to the planet’s most fearsome storms — supercharging them with heat and moisture until they become almost unrecognizable from the Atlantic hurricanes of the past.\n \n\n   \n   Jamaica is waking up to devastation , with severe damage to infrastructure including the electric grid, hospitals and schools. But the true extent of the damage in the hardest-hit communities may take days to uncover, as rescue workers and families struggle to reach them.\n \n\n   \n  Three days before landfall, Hurricane Melissa underwent two periods of rapid intensification as it traversed ocean water that were about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than average for this time of year.\n \n\n   \n  Human-caused climate change made such hot water far more likely,  according to the research group Climate Central .\n \n\n   \n  And as it moved through those water, Hurricane Melissa’s maximum sustained winds doubled from 70 mph — a tropical storm — on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane just 24 hours later.\n \n\n   \n  Then from Sunday afternoon through Monday afternoon its peak winds spiked again, going from 140 mph to 175 mph. It then intensified further overnight Monday into Tuesday morning during its final approach to the Jamaican coast.\n \n\n   \n  This type of hurricane behavior is becoming more common. “We’ve seen a notable uptick in the rates of explosive intensification,” with winds increasing by at least 60 mph in 24 hours across most ocean basins, during the past four decades or more, said Steve Bowen, chief scientist at Gallagher Re. It’s what scientists have been predicting, he said: Hotter oceans are going to support “top-tier intensity” hurricanes.\n \n\n   \n  “In short, nature continues to reaffirm the basic laws of thermodynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  Kerry Emanuel, a veteran hurricane researcher at MIT, said we are now seeing evidence of greater human-caused influences on these massive storms.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the third Category 5 tropical cyclone in the Atlantic this year, and the other two also went through periods of rapid intensification,” he told CNN in an email. “Taken together, this season might be said to be consistent with what we have been saying for some time,” he said, which is that: “The proportion of global tropical cyclones reaching high intensity is increasing, as is the incidence of rapidly intensifying storms.”\n \n\n   \n  This season has been “fairly normal” in terms of the number of Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes, Emanuel noted, which is also in line with studies showing that a warming world is unlikely to feature more tropical cyclones per season.\n \n\n   \n  But other research indicates that as the climate warms in response to human-caused pollution, tropical storms and hurricanes are capable of dumping heavier rainfall. This is because warmer air can carry greater amounts of moisture, and warming seas also allow for the evaporation of greater amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere, giving hurricanes more energy.\n \n\n   \n  Ocean temperatures are a primary driver of hurricane strength, Emanuel said. Melissa reached its so-called maximum potential intensity — a metric he devised for determining how strong a storm can theoretically get if it were able to take full advantage of such environmental drivers.\n \n\n   \n  Very few storms reach this point due to inhibiting factors such as strong winds in the upper atmosphere. Melissa managed to do this despite the fact that the maximum potential intensity metric itself was above average for its location in the Caribbean at this time of year, Emanuel said. This mainly reflects the hotter ocean temperatures.\n \n\n   \n  “This storm just pretty much did all of the things you wouldn’t want a storm to do,” said Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at UCLA. He said the reaching of its maximum potential intensity is especially noteworthy, and that the rapid intensification and other observed storm characteristics bear clear climate change fingerprints.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Kossin, a former scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who has conducted multiple studies on hurricanes and climate change, says connecting the dots between Hurricane Melissa and global warming, broadly, is relatively straightforward.\n \n\n   \n  “The very warm water almost certainly has a human fingerprint on it and there is no question that this warm water played a key role in Melissa’s intensity and intensification rate,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts also pointed to the storm’s rapid intensification while located in an ocean basin with unusually hot sea surface temperatures, and hot water extending to deep depths as well, as human-caused factors that helped lead to this disaster.\n \n\n   \n  However, not all aspects of the storm can be so easily attributed to climate change, including its slow movement.  Despite observations of a  trend toward slower-moving storms  in the Atlantic and other ocean basins in recent years, the causal connection is not as well established, Kossin said.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe the most important thing to understand about hurricanes in the warming world is that not all of them will be able to take advantage of the raised ceiling from ocean warming, but some of them will, and this one did,” Swain said.\n \n\n   \n  “And when we have situations like this, where it happens near or over a populated area that is susceptible to major effects, that the subsequent devastation will have been made worse, significantly worse, by climate change.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/americas/brazil-police-raid-rio-de-janeiro-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"13:41:00-04:00","title":"Largest ever police raid in Rio de Janeiro leaves at least 132 dead, public defender’s office says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive police raid in Rio de Janeiro’s Alemão favela, described by Governor Cláudio Castro as the largest in the city’s history, resulted in at least 132 deaths, including four police officers.

Among the dead are four Brazilian police officers, the office added.\n \n\n   \n  Rio de Janeiro State Governor Cláudio Castro said at a press conference that the “official figure” from the raid on Tuesday is 58 deaths, “but that number will certainly change” as more forensic work is completed. Dozens of bodies found by favela residents were displayed in the streets for families to identify after the deadly raid, Reuters news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  “We can use what was done yesterday as the beginning of a great effort, the beginning of a great era, where everyone will unite, everyone will be able to work together, and we will have good conditions to free the people of Rio,” Castro said.\n \n\n   \n  Castro told reporters that police confiscated a “large quantity of drugs” in the raid, according to Reuters.

Its name, Portuguese for “Red Command,” is a reference to its origins as a leftist prisoners’ organization formed during the military dictatorship that ruled over Brazil until 1985.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Red Command has become a massive, transnational criminal group, involved in drug trafficking and extortion.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US is withdrawing some troops from Romania, on NATO’s eastern flank, as the Pentagon works to shift its focus away from Europe and toward homeland defense and Latin America, US and European officials said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The US is sending home the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division back to Kentucky and will not be replacing the unit after its scheduled rotation out of Eastern Europe, according to US Army Europe and Africa. The redeployment comes as eastern flank NATO countries have faced a spike in threats from Russia in recent weeks, including multiple drone incursions in Polish airspace and repeated violations of Lithuanian airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The Army said the reduction in troops is part of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s “deliberate process to ensure a balanced U.S. military force posture.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an American withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to NATO and Article 5,” the Army press release said. “Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility. Our NATO allies are meeting President Trump’s call to take primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe. This force posture adjustment will not change the security environment in Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Ministry of Defense said in a separate statement that it had “been informed about the withdrawal of some of the American troops deployed on NATO’s Eastern Flank, as part of the process of reassessing the global posture of US military forces.” The ministry added that “approximately one thousand American soldiers will remain deployed on our national territory.”\n \n\n   \n  “The downsizing of the U.S. forces is an effect of the new priorities of the presidential administration,” the Romanian defense statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The US troops will be pulled from Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base on the Black Sea, just across from Crimea which remains under de facto Russian control.\n \n\n   \n  The withdrawal of some troops sparked rare GOP backlash to Pentagon decision making, with Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Republican Rep. Mike Rogers saying in a joint statement that the move “sends the wrong signal to Russia at the very moment President Trump is applying pressure to force Vladimir Putin to come to the table to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed Services committee, said they “strongly oppose,” the decision and called it “concerning that Congress was not consulted in advance of this decision.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are seeking clarification from the Pentagon on how it plans to mitigate the impact of this decision on NATO’s deterrence and defense posture and whether they coordinated with Allies to minimize these consequences,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  The US still has more troops deployed in Europe than it did before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, NATO officials told CNN. But NATO defense planners are watching closely to see whether the US moves to further downsize its presence there, since that would likely require that NATO reconsider how allied troops are deployed across the continent, one of the officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/middleeast/israel-military-strikes-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"Deadliest Day in Gaza Since Ceasefire as Israel Launches Wave of Strikes, Accusing Hamas of Breaching Truce","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 29, 2025, Israel launched a wave of strikes in Gaza, killing at least 104 people — including 46 children and 20 women — marking the deadliest day since the ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.

strikes in Gaza killed at least 104 people, including dozens of children, the enclave’s health authorities said on Wednesday, marking the deadliest day since the beginning of the ceasefire championed by US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes came Tuesday night after Israel accused Hamas of killing a soldier and staging the discovery of a deceased hostage.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the military to carry out “immediate, powerful strikes in the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a short statement. The US was notified of the decision to carry out strikes in Gaza, a US official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Wednesday it will resume the ceasefire but will continue to “respond forcefully to any violation.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas denounced what it called the “criminal bombardment” by Israel, which it said violated the ceasefire agreement. It also denied attacking Israeli soldiers and reaffirmed its commitment to the truce.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said later that it had “conducted a precise strike in the area of Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip targeting a terrorist infrastructure site where weapons and aerial means were stored, intended to be used for the execution of an imminent terror attack against IDF soldiers and the State of Israel” on Wednesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  The statement added that soldiers in the Southern Command “remain deployed in accordance with the ceasefire agreement and will continue to operate to remove any immediate threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At least 104 people were killed in the strikes across Gaza overnight Tuesday, according to the Ministry of Health in the battered enclave. These include at least 46 children and 20 women, the ministry said. UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the killing of civilians and “all actions that undermine the ceasefire and endanger civilian lives,” his spokesperson said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The director of Al-Shifa Hospital described the health and humanitarian situation as “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are no medicines or medical supplies to treat the wounded and the sick.” Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military named the soldier killed as Master Sergeant Yona Efraim Feldbaum, aged 37, from the settlement of Zayit Raanan in the occupied West Bank. A member of the Combat Engineering Corps in the Gaza Division, Feldbaum died durning combat in southern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.\n \n\n   \n  A military official said Hamas had attacked Israeli troops east of the so-called yellow line, which separates Israeli-occupied Gaza from the remainder of the territory. The troops, in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, had come under RPG and sniper fire, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said it was his understanding that “they killed an Israeli soldier,” without naming Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  “So the Israelis hit back,” he told reporters on Air Force One on his way to South Korea, speaking before the reports of dozens of casualties from the Israeli strikes had emerged.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing’s going to jeopardize” the ceasefire, he added, repeating threats that Hamas would be “terminated.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Tuesday, Netanyahu’s office  said  that Hamas was in “clear violation” of the Gaza ceasefire agreement after returning remains to Israel that did not belong to any of the 13 hostages still unaccounted for in the enclave.\n \n\n   \n  An Israeli official told CNN that among the options being considered are expanding the so-called yellow line – Israel’s withdrawal line in Gaza – reoccupying additional territory, or retaking the Netzarim corridor, which cuts across Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Another Israeli source told CNN that any response would be coordinated with the US, adding that Israel was also considering restricting the flow of humanitarian aid, but Washington opposes such a step.\n \n\n   \n    Israel says Hamas staged discovery\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military also released a drone video on Tuesday that it said shows Hamas operatives burying a white cloth containing a body in Gaza City and then staging its discovery in front of the Red Cross.\n \n\n   \n  In the nearly 15-minute clip, three men are seen dragging a white shroud into a bulldozed plot of land near a building and covering the shroud with dirt. After the shroud is completely covered, a bulldozer scoops up the dirt and drops it into a nearby pile. Moments later, Red Cross officials arrive on the scene as the shroud containing the body is pulled from the dirt. With the Red Cross standing nearby, the video shows the white cloth being buried and uncovered once again as someone with a cell phone appears to take a video of the scene.\n \n\n   \n  The military said the video showed that Hamas “is attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies” of the remaining deceased hostages. CNN cannot independently verify the video or the identities of the individuals in it.\n \n\n   \n  The Red Cross said that its team was “not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones,” the Red Cross said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The organization said that it had agreed to operate as an intermediary “in good faith” and noted that the situation in Gaza is “exceedingly challenging to work in.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment on the video.\n \n\n   \n    Hamas postpones hostage handover\n \n\n   \n  Soon after Netanyahu said Israel would carry out new strikes in Gaza, the armed wing of Hamas announced it would postpone the handover of a hostage’s body that was recovered in southern Gaza on Tuesday due to Israel’s “violations.”\n \n\n   \n  The militant group also warned that any Israeli escalation would “hinder search and excavation operations and the retrieval of bodies” of the deceased Israeli hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas had been set to transfer remains of a deceased hostage to Israel via the Red Cross on Tuesday. The group said the body had been pulled from a tunnel in Khan Younis.\n \n\n   \n  A second body was unearthed in Nuseirat in central Gaza from the rubble of a building where Israel had carried out a rescue operation in June 2024. The operation rescued three Israeli hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas said at the time that other hostages had been killed during the Israeli operation, which both Israel and the US denied. But CNN has geolocated footage from the recovery of the body that shows it is the same building where the rescue occurred, raising fresh questions about whether Israeli hostages were killed during the mission. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said more than 270 Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured as a result of the rescue operation.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas returned partial remains to Israel Monday that did not belong to any of the 13 hostages still unaccounted for in the enclave. Israel identified the remains as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 and recovered during an Israeli military operation in Gaza in November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war on Hamas after the October 7, 2023, terror attacks in which the militant group and its allies killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 hostages to Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  In the two years since, more than 68,000 Palestinians have been killed and over 170,000 injured in the enclave, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.\n \n\n   \n  Thousands of Palestinians are believed to be buried under the rubble.\n \n\n   \n  Israel  approved  the ceasefire on October 9, 2025. The agreement included several conditions, including the release of all Israeli hostages both living and dead, and the withdrawal of some Israeli troops from Gaza. As of Tuesday, Hamas had returned only 15 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages who remained in Gaza at the time the ceasefire was signed.\n \n\n   \n   Ibrahim Dahman, Mohammad Al Sawalhi, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Eugenia Yosef contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/ukraine-car-bomb-veniamin-mazzherin-death-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Ukraine says it killed Russian officer in Siberia using car bomb","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine claims it assassinated Russian military officer Veniamin Mazzherin, deputy commander of a military police unit in Kemerovo, Siberia, using a car bomb, citing his role in war crimes and genocide during the 2022 invasion.

assassinations of Russian figures inside their own territory.\n \n\n   \n  In April, Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik was  killed in a car explosion  outside Moscow. Russian authorities said they charged a “Ukrainian special services agent” with terrorism, though Ukraine did not claim any responsibility for the incident.\n \n\n   \n  A few months before that, a top Russian general accused of using chemical weapons in Ukraine was  killed by a remotely detonated bomb  planted in an electric scooter outside an apartment building in Moscow. A source with knowledge of the operation told CNN that Ukraine’s security services were behind the assassination.\n \n\n   \n  In November 2023, Ukraine said it was responsible for the assassination of  Mikhail Filiponenko , a lawmaker in a Kremlin-installed assembly in the occupied eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk.

Several other children and health care workers were also injured, the Kherson Regional Prosecutor’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky called the shelling a “deliberate Russian attack specifically against children, against medical personnel (and) against basic guarantees of life in the community” in a  post on X , saying that Russia “could not have been unaware” of what it was striking.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia is now the largest terrorist organization in the world, which is not only dragging out its terrorist war but also trying to do everything possible to ensure that no opportunity to end the war succeeds,” the Ukrainian leader continued.\n \n\n   \n  “Terrorists must be dealt with only as they deserve – with strength and just treatment. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine,” Zelensky said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, on Ukraine’s eastern front, Russian forces have infiltrated the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, according to Ukrainian officials. Tens of thousands of troops have amassed in the direction of Pokrovsk, the 7th Corps of the Airborne Forces of Ukraine said in a Telegram post Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment on the developments in Pokrovsk and the reported strike in Kherson.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/tech/character-ai-teens-under-18-app-changes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Character.AI to Ban Teens from Open-Ended Chat with AI Characters Amid Lawsuits and Mental Health Concerns","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Character.AI, the AI chatbot platform, has announced it will no longer allow teens under 18 to engage in open-ended conversations with its chatbots by November 25, 2025, following multiple lawsuits alleging that interactions with the app contributed to suicide and mental health crises.

Before long, a doctor was delivering the news that no pitcher wants to hear: He had torn his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL).\n \n\n   \n  It is an injury which has plagued  Major League Baseball  for the best part of the  last century . The ligament in your elbow which connects the bone in your upper arm to the one in your forearm – and is only about as strong as “a piece of celery” – tears, leaving you unable to throw and facing a very lengthy spell on the sidelines.\n \n\n   \n  This season, the likes of  Gerrit Cole , Corbin Burnes and Shane Bieber have all had  Tommy John surgery  – the most popular procedure to repair a torn UCL – while Japanese superstar  Shohei Ohtani  made his long-awaited  return to the mound  after almost 22 months away following the second elbow surgery of his career.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Christopher Ahmad, Tommy John expert and head team physician for the  New York Yankees , has performed the surgery on some of the biggest names in baseball. But he has also been privy to the other side of the story.\n \n\n   \n  “The alarms are going off on how devastating this problem is to the youngest players,” he says in an interview with  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  “When I first started doing Tommy John surgery about 25 years ago, the population who I was operating on who needed the surgery were essentially very high-level players – they were college prospects destined to be professional, or professional players.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, the population who needs the surgery most are kids.”\n \n\n   \n  Of the 10-15 Tommy John surgeries that he performs every week, Ahmad estimates that between eight and 10 are on high school children, with some even still in middle school.\n \n\n   \n  Such a high number of young players going under the knife is a relatively new phenomenon. In 2005, four players selected in the top 10 rounds of the amateur draft had already had Tommy John surgery earlier in their college or high school careers. By 2025, that figure had increased ninefold to 36.\n \n\n   \n  But why?\n \n\n   \n    Need for speed\n \n\n   \n  One issue is that, simply, young pitchers are throwing faster than they ever have before.\n \n\n   \n  “The big problem now is performance. It’s the desire and the hunt for velocity,” says Ahmad.\n \n\n   \n  With thousands of aspiring college and professional players across the US, and an increased emphasis on pitch speed in the professional game, one surefire way to get noticed is to put the biggest number on the radar gun.\n \n\n   \n  “The chase in velocity is really impacting these kids,” says Frank Alexander, the athletic trainer who works with Ahmad’s patients during their recovery phase, in an interview with CNN Sports. “Everybody’s chasing triple digits, and these kids just want to keep up with the Joneses.”\n \n\n   \n  That chase has created a burgeoning industry of “velocity enhancement programs” and special techniques designed to get young players throwing fast.\n \n\n   \n  In Durnin’s case, that technique was pulldowns, a drill where pitchers take a running start to try and throw as hard as they possibly can.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a training technique popularized by Driveline,” he explains. “There’s a lot of mixed feelings upon it because it does have a tendency to cause injuries.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Driveline for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “I was doing pulldowns, I was trying to break the facility record (of 101 mph). I did not break the record, and I got hurt doing so,” Durnin adds with a wry smile.\n \n\n   \n  “It does seem a bit reckless. If you’re watching you’re like ‘Well, this seems like something wrong can happen.’ But obviously you can get injured doing many things. I don’t think pulldowns are bad. I don’t think pulldowns are going to injure you 100%. I think just with all training methods, you’re toeing the line between excellence and energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Baseball is such big business nowadays that players are willing to put their own health on the line more than ever before if it means a shot at earning truly life-changing money.\n \n\n   \n  The chance – however slim – of bringing in Ohtani or Juan Soto money ($700 million and $765 million, respectively), is one that many are happy to take the risk for.\n \n\n   \n  “I had some draft interest. I had met with probably around half of the teams via Zoom or in-person meetings. And so that was a big gold mine. Along with every other baseball player, you want to get drafted and pursue a professional career,” Durnin explains.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to get yourself in those conversations and be able to get drafted and get paid what we want to get paid, you have to be the top .001%. And in order to be that top .001%, you have to have a skillset – and that’s throwing hard, that’s throwing really good pitches. In order to do that, you have to train, and if you’re not willing to train really hard and push the limits, someone else is, and that person will take your spot.”\n \n\n   \n  Alex Hoffman was even younger – just 15 – when he tore his UCL. Like many teenagers, he was playing two different positions.\n \n\n   \n  “I was definitely overworked and I definitely wasn’t taking care of myself as much as I should,” Hoffman, now 17, says in an interview with CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “I was catching and pitching. So that was a lot of stress on the arm, constantly throwing the ball back or throwing the ball to the catcher. My arm never really had a break. So, ultimately, I believe that it was just that my arm couldn’t keep up and it broke down.”\n \n\n   \n  No one asked Hoffman to play both positions. No one asked Durnin to try and break the facility’s velocity record. Both – understandably eager to play and impress – took it on themselves to stretch their bodies to the point where their elbows could not take any more.\n \n\n   \n  But, in the 10 years he has worked with Ahmad, Alexander has seen plenty of instances when coaches and scouts  have  directly pushed their young athletes too far.\n \n\n   \n  “One kid that we had was in high school when he had Tommy John surgery, and his pre-surgery velocity was in the low 90s,” he remembers.\n \n\n   \n  “He was talking to the college that he was being recruited by, he had a verbal commitment with them, and it was going to the year that he could sign his National Letter of Intent. So he was rehabbing, he was 10 months post-op, and the coaches are like, ‘You need to be throwing low 90s.’\n \n\n   \n  “And I remember vividly the conversation with him, mom and dad in the room, and I’m like ‘Whoa, this is a rehabbing elbow. This isn’t a healthy elbow. That’s an unrealistic goal for you at 10 months post-op.’”\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, in his chase to keep hold of that non-binding verbal commitment, the young pitcher broke down again.\n \n\n   \n  “He was chasing that velocity … he’s knocking on the door of being completely cleared, getting ready to be back and play. And he said his elbow started bothering him again,” Alexander says. “Later, we came to find out that the school actually pulled the scholarship.”\n \n\n   \n  While not every case is that extreme, the mismanagement of young players is rampant in the US – one 2021  study  found that 90% of youth teams it surveyed were violating Pitch Smart guidelines, which stipulate pitch counts and rest times for young pitchers.\n \n\n   \n  “Coaches have to win at the college level, even at the high school level, so they’ll abuse players more often than we would like to see,” explains Ahmad. “We would like to see parents and coaches protecting kids. They actually need to win also for their job security.”\n \n\n   \n    Mental scars\n \n\n   \n  When, in 1974, Dr. Frank Jobe took a tendon from Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tommy John’s forearm and tied it through the bones in his elbow, Jobe estimated the chances his patient would pitch again at one in 100.\n \n\n   \n  John, though, went on to pitch in three World Series and three more All-Star games. The surgery, frankly, was and is a miracle.\n \n\n   \n  These days, there are success stories all across baseball. Ohtani sent the Dodgers to this year’s World Series with a win and 10 strikeouts – not to mention  three home runs  – against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 4 of the NLCS.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, both Durnin and Hoffman are delighted they went under the knife, and both are now back on the diamond and making the next steps in their promising careers.\n \n\n   \n  Such is the publicized success of the surgery, many players treat it as a foregone conclusion that they will have to take a year out of their careers at some point.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s now a culture and an appreciation that Tommy John surgery is kind of part of the game. I often call it the Tommy John generation,” says Ahmad. “Everybody just has this feeling that it’s inevitable.”\n \n\n   \n  On the other side of the  World Series  matchup, Bieber has returned to the elite level even quicker than Ohtani, starting two games and winning one as the Toronto Blue Jays’ snatched the ALCS from the Seattle Mariners despite only coming back to play in late August.\n \n\n   \n   Game 4 of the World Series  on October 28 – where the Blue Jays drew even with the Dodgers at two games apiece – even saw Bieber face off against Ohtani in an all-Tommy John pitching contest which simply would not have been possible without the incredible advancements the surgery has allowed.\n \n\n   \n  Nowadays, many view a UCL injury as a significant bump in the road rather than a career-ending injury. But not everyone is as fortunate as John, Durnin and Hoffman.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a misperception about how good the operation is,” explains Ahmad. “With surgery, from a performance perspective, we’ll have a very high chance of getting back to baseball. But your performance may not be the same.”\n \n\n   \n  On top of that, the general prevalence of UCL injuries appears to be making MLB teams think far more carefully about whether to select pitchers in the draft.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of all available pitchers selected in the first three rounds dropped from 73% in 2014 to 38% in 2025, which is perhaps unsurprising when you consider that a 2021  study  found that 70% of pitchers entering the draft had abnormal findings on MRI scans of their elbow.\n \n\n   \n  “I do have a role with the Yankees where I help identify risk factors for potential players: amateur players in the draft, professional players who are free agents, etc. And part of that evaluation is what their future potential for injury is,” says Ahmad.\n \n\n   \n  “So many clubs now are being a little more cautious about how they use their draft picks when there’s injury potential and they’re going to lose that draft pick to surgery and time away from baseball.”\n \n\n   \n  The risks of injury and subsequent surgery can extend beyond a sporting context. In 2021, college pitcher Sang Ho Baek  died  following complications from Tommy John surgery shortly after his freshman season.\n \n\n   \n  While instances like Baek’s are thankfully extremely rare, the psychological impact of a UCL injury can often be devastating to young players. Alexander recalls giving the bad news to one prospect.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re telling him: ‘Your UCL is torn,’” he remembers. “And this kid, he had such a visceral reaction, he actually started rocking back and forth on the examining table, and he’s like ‘No, it’s not. It’s not. It can’t be.’ And he was being talked about getting drafted even out of high school, so his world just came crashing down around him.”\n \n\n   \n  For many players, the extended period spent away from the field can be just as difficult as the moment they find out about their injury.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a year-long recovery and, during that year-long recovery, it’s hard to be away from the game,” says Ahmad, who is in the process of setting up what he calls a “Tommy John support group” for recovering players. “They lose their identity. The fear of failure starts to creep in.”\n \n\n   \n  “Every day is constant mental warfare,” Durnin reflects on his rehab. “You have two sides. One side is telling you that you’re never gonna get back, and that these guys are so far ahead of you that you’re always going to be chasing them. And the other side is like ‘Hey, you can do it, you know it, you’re fine.’”\n \n\n   \n  The mental anguish experienced by these young men is often even more serious than what the likes of Durnin went through – a recent  study  conducted by Alexander and Ahmad, among others, concluded that nearly 30% of baseball players who sustained a UCL injury qualified for a probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n \n\n   \n  “There were players that had symptoms that could lead to future immune system compromise,” Alexander comments. “So what they’re experiencing is real.”\n \n\n   \n  In the past, MLB has been receptive to rule changes to protect the safety of its athletes – just ask anyone running from third base who no longer has to barrel through the catcher in order to touch home.\n \n\n   \n  The problem with pitching, however, is any adjustment would result in a profound change to the sport.\n \n\n   \n  “There may come a time when we design rules around baseball that say you can only throw so many pitches,” says Ahmad. “There may come a time when we say, if you throw too hard, that’s illegal – you can’t throw 102 miles an hour. I’m being a little silly because I don’t think that’s ever going to really happen.”\n \n\n   \n  The Yankees physician points to the possibility of six-man rotations to aid rest and recovery.\n \n\n   \n  But teams will always look for players who can throw hard and often. Fans like them. Teammates like them. Coaches and scouts like them.\n \n\n   \n  “What we celebrate for performance is also exactly what puts you at risk for needing the surgery,” Ahmad explains.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the essential problem in baseball: what makes you better also makes you injured.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/boeing-china-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00-04:00","title":"Boeing Reports Massive Loss But Could Benefit from a Huge Chinese Airline Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Boeing reported a massive $5 billion core operating loss in Q3 2025, bringing total cumulative losses since 2019 to over $47.2 billion, largely due to delays in the 777X jet delivery schedule, now pushed to 2027.

It still might be its best week in more than six years \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:49 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Boeing reported yet another massive quarterly loss Wednesday. It could still be an extremely good week to be Boeing.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because the US planemaker could finally get a huge order from Chinese airlines, a market that the company has been frozen out for nearly a decade.\n \n\n   \n  Boeing is reportedly close to reaching a deal that could result in as many as 500 jet orders from Chinese airlines in the coming days or weeks, possibly as soon as President Donald Trump meets with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday, according to  multiple outlets .   \n \n\n   \n  Deals of this magnitude, which require the approval of the Chinese government and not just the airlines, have often been announced when the leaders of the two counties met face-to-face.\n \n\n   \n  And US Ambassador to China David Purdue  told reporters  and visiting members of Congress last month that negotiations for a “huge” deal are close to conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Boeing passenger jet sales to mainland China have ground to a near halt since trade disputes between China and the United States first heated up at the start of the first Trump administration. Boeing has sold only 49 jets to China since 2018, with 14 going to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific and virtually all of the the rest made up of freighter aircrafts or sales to Chinese leasing companies, not the airlines themselves.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a small fraction of more than 1,000 Boeing jet sales to Chinese customers in the ten years before 2018.\n \n\n   \n  China is one of the world’s key markets for commercial airline sales given its booming air travel growth. Boeing’s own estimates are that the Chinese fleet of passenger planes is due to double in the next 20 years, with Chinese airlines predicted to buy 9,000 jets.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a market Boeing can’t afford to lose to its perpetual rival, Airbus.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been happy to trumpet sales of Boeing jets to other countries since returning to office, including from  Qatar  and Uzbekistan. So disclosing a large order for Chinese planes as a  trade deal with China  is announced would keep with past practice.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly the administration and the president are doing a great job with helping us book orders in the market,” Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said on CNBC Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about a possible  US-Chinese trade deal , Ortberg said that it’s “important to us.”\n \n\n   \n  “And we’re very hopeful that if we have positive trade negotiations, that will come with some more business with us,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Some plane orders might not be “new”\n \n\n   \n  Analysts say it’s possible that many of the “new” orders from China were booked by Boeing over the last nine years, but not announced due to trade tensions and the Chinese government trying to put leverage on the US government.\n \n\n   \n  Of the roughly 6,000 jets that Boeing has in its backlog, more than 850 are to “unidentified customers.” More than 600 additional jets have been sold to leasing companies that could be buying them on behalf of Chinese customers.\n \n\n   \n  But even if some of the orders announced as part of the deal were quietly booked already, well over half will likely be new jet orders, Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst for Bank of America, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    “Caught in the crossfire”\n \n\n   \n  Many of Boeing’s problems can be traced back to the company’s own mistakes, such as two 737 Max crashes tied to a design flaw that killed a total of 346 people.\n \n\n   \n  But Boeing’s problems in China don’t really stem from safety concerns, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s 100% politics,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t some sort of internal screw up,” said Epstein. “They’re just caught in the crossfire.”\n \n\n   \n  But even if Boeing announces a mega deal with China is announced, it still has other problems to deal with.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday it reported a much bigger than expected core operating loss in the third quarter of $5 billion, bringing cumulative losses since the 737 Max grounding in 2019 to $47.2 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Much of that latest loss was due to a $4.9 billion charge due to another delay in the start of deliveries for the 777X, its next generation widebody jet that it now said won’t be ready until 2027.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/wole-soyinka-visa-revoked-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00-04:00","title":"Nigeria’s Nobel-winning author Wole Soyinka says his US visa was revoked","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nobel Prize-winning Nigerian author Wole Soyinka has been denied a U.S. non-resident visa, which he believes may stem from his recent public criticism of former President Donald Trump, comparing him to the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.

Most cases occur in children under 5, with outbreaks commonly linked to schools and day care centers. HFMD is a highly contagious viral illness caused by enteroviruses, primarily coxsackievirus A16, presenting with fever, mouth sores, and a rash. It spreads through close contact, respiratory droplets, and contaminated surfaces. While the illness is generally mild and resolves in 7–10 days, treatment focuses on symptom relief, including pain management and hydration.

A doctor explains symptoms and treatment \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:32 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Health officials in the mid-Atlantic region have recently reported a rise in hand, foot and mouth disease, or HFMD.\n \n\n   \n  There were  197  emergency department visits related to the disease in September, primarily among children younger than 5, according to the District of Columbia Health Department. The  Virginia Department of Health  is also reporting significant increases in emergency department and urgent care visits for hand, foot and mouth disease. Compared with previous years, in Virginia and  West Virginia , there has been a notable increase in reported outbreaks, with schools and day care centers accounting for the majority of outbreaks.\n \n\n   \n  What is hand, foot and mouth disease, and what causes it? How is it spread? What are the symptoms, and how long do they last? Can adults also get it? How is it diagnosed and treated? Should parents keep children home from school or day care when they have it? What steps can families take to help prevent infection?\n \n\n   \n  To help us answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is hand, foot and mouth disease? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  Hand, foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious  viral illness  that primarily affects infants and young children. It’s caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. It is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease, which affects farm animals like cattle, sheep, pigs and goats and does not infect humans.\n \n\n   \n  Hand, foot and mouth disease gets its name from the small blister-like sores it causes on the hands and feet and inside the mouth. While the illness can be uncomfortable, it is generally mild and resolves on its own.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is it spread, and who is most at risk? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads very easily through close personal contact and contaminated surfaces. A person can become infected after being exposed to droplets released when someone with the illness coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread through touching an infected person, such as during hugging, kissing, or sharing cups and utensils. The virus is present in stool as well, so changing diapers or helping a sick child in the bathroom can lead to infection if hands aren’t washed thoroughly.\n \n\n   \n  It can also spread when someone touches objects or surfaces like toys or doorknobs that have the virus on them, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. Rarely, people can become infected by swallowing contaminated recreational water, such as from a pool that hasn’t been properly treated.\n \n\n   \n  Young children are most at risk because their immune systems are still developing, and they are more likely to struggle with personal hygiene and share toys and have close contact with others.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What are the symptoms, and how long do they last?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:   The first sign  of the disease is usually a fever, followed by a sore throat and a general feeling of being unwell. These flu-like symptoms typically start three to five days after catching the virus. A day or two later, small painful spots can develop inside the mouth, often on the tongue, gums or inner cheeks. These spots can turn into tiny blisters or ulcers, making it uncomfortable for children to eat or drink.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, a rash can appear on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the buttocks, legs or arms. The rash may look like flat red spots or small bumps that can form blisters, but it typically doesn’t itch. Some children have the mouth sores without the rash, while others have the rash without any sores.\n \n\n   \n  Most cases are mild and clear up on their own in about a week to 10 days. During that time, it’s important to keep children well hydrated, since mouth pain can make them less willing to drink fluids.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Can adults also get it?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes, although it’s much more common in young children. Because most people are first exposed during childhood, adults often have some immunity. Still, anyone who hasn’t been infected before or whose immune system is weakened  can catch it  through close contact with someone who is sick.\n \n\n   \n  When teenagers or adults do get hand, foot and mouth disease, symptoms are usually mild or may not appear at all. Some adults may have only a sore throat or mild rash without the typical mouth sores or blisters. However, they can still spread the virus to others, including young children.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is hand, foot and mouth disease diagnosed and treated?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Health care providers usually diagnose the disease based on the characteristic symptoms and recent exposure to other sick children. A physical exam is typically enough to confirm the diagnosis. In rare cases, if the illness looks unusual or severe, the clinician may collect a throat swab or stool sample to test for the specific virus.\n \n\n   \n  There is no specific medicine that cures hand, foot and mouth disease. Because it’s caused by a virus, antibiotics do not help. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can reduce fever and mouth pain, and cool, soft foods or cold drinks can make eating and drinking more comfortable.\n \n\n   \n  Staying hydrated is the most important part of care, since mouth sores can make swallowing painful and dehydration can develop quickly in young children. Most cases clear up on their own without complications, but parents should contact a doctor if a child cannot keep fluids down, has a high fever lasting more than a few days or seems unusually drowsy or irritable.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Should parents keep children home from school or day care?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Because hand, foot and mouth disease tends to be mild, children don’t need to stay home for the entire illness. The guidance from the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  is that they can return to school or day care once they no longer have a fever, feel well enough to take part in normal activities, and can manage any mouth sores without excessive drooling.\n \n\n   \n  Parents should also check with their school or day care, since specific policies may vary. The CDC cautions that in some situations, such as during an outbreak, the local health department may ask families to keep affected children home temporarily to help limit further spread.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there steps families can take to help prevent infection? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes. Regular and thorough handwashing is one of the most effective protective measures. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper, before preparing or eating food, and after blowing the nose or coughing.\n \n\n   \n  Covering coughs and sneezes, ideally using a disposable tissue or the crook of the elbow, can help stop the spread of virus-laden droplets. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. And people should also avoid close personal contact with infected individuals. This means no sharing of drinks, utensils, toothbrushes or towels, and keeping hugs or kisses to a minimum if someone is ill.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/us/immigration-crackdown-car-crashes-rammings","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-04:00","title":"Car crashes and rammings take center stage in immigration crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has intensified, with a dramatic rise in vehicular confrontations between federal agents and suspects, including crashes, intentional ramming, and shootings.

\n       \n  By Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration’s  crackdown on illegal immigration  often looks like a car crash.\n \n\n   \n  Literally.\n \n\n   \n  There have been car crashes between federal agents and suspects trying to flee. There have been alleged “rammings” involving pro-immigrant activists. There have been dramatic traffic stops featuring smashed windows and law enforcement shootings. Even the standoffs outside ICE facilities have focused on tense moments around the arrival or departure of federal vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  These incidents, many captured on video, have provided some of the most dramatic visuals of the immigration crackdown this year.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re the most highly visible, and I think they’re so unusual that it shocks the psyche to see federal agents making administrative warrant arrests and using potential deadly force tactics,” said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the  Council on Criminal Justice , a nonpartisan think tank.\n \n\n   \n  The crashes show federal law enforcement’s use of aggressive tactics in busy city streets, such as dangerous “PIT” maneuvers, unmarked cars and masked officers, law enforcement and immigration   experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The collisions also reflect the desperate fear of the immigration targets, who, in some cases, have tried to flee when faced with the potential end of their freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “Often people in their cars get scared and they try to drive away, knowing that stopping and talking to ICE might end up in a severe violation of their constitutional rights and arrest and detention,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the  American Immigration Council , a pro-immigration nonprofit group.\n \n\n   \n  “This kind of interaction on the streets – using traffic stops, people fearful when ICE or federal agents are following them – leads to the kinds of accidents and crashes that we’re starting to see in the news.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE Assistant Director of Public Affairs Emily Covington issued a statement to CNN on Monday about the “concerning increase in vehicular attacks” in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “Attacks against ICE law enforcement have increased by 1000% since last year, and aggressors are now purposefully running into officers, boxing in law enforcement vehicles, running ICE law enforcement off the roads, and ramming their cars into law enforcement vehicles. This isn’t just the criminal alien targets doing this, but also bystanders who are obstructing and attacking us.\n \n\n   \n  “Encouraging these attacks has tragically resulted in serious bodily injury and hospitalizations thanks to the demonization of and flagrant disregard for ICE officers who work around the clock to arrest and remove public safety and national security threats from America’s streets, following the laws passed by Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement: “Anyone who intentionally rams law enforcement with their vehicle will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law—that’s a promise.”\n \n\n   \n    Vehicles used as arrest tactic\n \n\n   \n  Some of these car crashes have been initiated by federal agents and show a willingness to use  aggressive and potentially dangerous tactics .\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago on October 14, US Border Patrol agents  pursued and crashed into a vehicle  as part of an immigration enforcement operation, leading to an angry response from community residents.\n \n\n   \n  The incident unfolded when a white SUV hit the side of a red SUV, sending it backward through the intersection before it   crashed into another vehicle, video captured by a nearby resident showed. What appeared to be federal agents can then be seen exiting the white vehicle and chasing two people.\n \n\n   \n  The red SUV was driven by a person in the country illegally who rammed a Border Patrol vehicle before trying to flee the scene, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN. Agents used “an authorized precision immobilization technique (PIT) maneuver,” which forces a vehicle to spin out and stop, said DHS.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents eventually arrested the two individuals, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  “The PIT maneuver, a standard law enforcement technique used by law enforcement agencies across the country, is a specific tactic to defuse a dangerous pursuit situation,” McLaughlin told CNN. “CBP used the PIT maneuver once in Chicago — and it was to  stop a pursuit and dangerous situation  after two individuals tried to kill Border Patrol law enforcement officers.”\n \n\n   \n  A PIT maneuver is considered a use of deadly force and is justifiable in certain situations, depending on the suspect’s risk to the public, the risk to the officer and the potential collateral damage of a crash, according to Jerry Robinette, a former special agent in charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a series of factors that agents have to take into account before they even become involved in a high-risk pursuit,” he said. “When you’re involved in a high-risk pursuit, one of your main responsibilities is the general public, along with yourself and the violator.”\n \n\n   \n  Video of an October 16 crash in  Oxnard, California , also shows federal agents performing what appears to be an intentional crash.\n \n\n   \n  Video of the incident shows a dark gray truck driving in circles with an unmarked beige SUV closely following him around. Once the truck begins driving straight, the beige SUV speeds up and slams into the truck’s back-left side. It is not immediately clear what happened before the video starts.\n \n\n   \n  Leo Martinez, the driver of the truck, is a US citizen and an  immigration rights volunteer . He told CNN’s Erin Burnett last week he is one of multiple volunteers who have been patrolling neighborhoods in Ventura County to document ICE detentions and was shocked when the SUV he says was driven by federal agents drove into his truck.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez told CNN he was temporarily detained and then released from custody pending charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security responded to the incident in a statement, calling it a “targeted enforcement operation.”\n \n\n   \n    Crashes and traffic stops have led to shootings\n \n\n   \n  Traffic stops and car chases have long been considered some of the most dangerous of law enforcement   activities, and indeed some of these crashes have led to injuries and death.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, an  ICE officer fatally shot a man  who DHS said resisted arrest and dragged the officer during a vehicle stop in a Chicago suburb, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant, according to DHS. The officer, who was not immediately identified, was released from the hospital after suffering injuries, an ICE spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  In another incident, Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old US citizen, was  shot five times  by a US Customs and Border Protection agent after her vehicle and a federal law enforcement vehicle collided on October 4 in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  A federal criminal complaint accuses Martinez of ramming her car into the federal vehicle, and a DHS official referred to her as a “domestic terrorist.” However, her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows the federal agent swerved into her vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez has pleaded not guilty to a charge of assaulting, resisting, and impeding officers.\n \n\n   \n  In Los Angeles earlier this week, a federal marshal and an undocumented immigrant were injured after an agent’s weapon discharged during an immigration enforcement operation, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors allege  Carlitos Ricardo Parias , a TikTok influencer, rammed law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to dislodge his car during an immigration arrest. Authorities said Parias is a 44-year-old Mexican national living illegally in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Parias has been charged with assault on a federal officer, according to a  statement  from the US Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very pacifist man. He’s very calm,” his lawyer Carlos Jurado told  CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS . “A lot of the police officers here know him. They know that he’s very respectful.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators believe gunfire erupted after an ICE officer confronted the suspect’s vehicle and smashed a window with their service weapon, a law enforcement source said. While attempting to grab the suspect, authorities believe the agent’s weapon discharged, striking both the suspect and a deputy US marshal. They are both expected to recover, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the mistrust of immigration enforcement can be dangerous for both suspects and officers, said Johnson, the senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice.\n \n\n   \n  “People are afraid,” he said. “If you’re afraid and you don’t trust the authorities – fight, flight or fear. Those responses to fear can get you killed or get officers hurt.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/trump-xi-meeting-agenda-vis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Trump and Xi are set for a high-stakes summit.

‘grocery buddies’ are feeding families at risk of losing SNAP benefits amid the government shutdown \n       \n  By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:18 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As a breastfeeding mom of a toddler – and with another child on the way – Gabrielle knows how vital it is to get the right nutrients, with her body serving both her children in different capacities.\n \n\n   \n  But the 21-year-old mother is worried about what the coming weeks will look like for her family as the  second-longest  government shutdown in US history threatens their access to a  critical food assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielle, who asked CNN to use only her first name due to the perceived stigma around needing assistance, is on﻿e of the 42 million Americans who rely on the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP , the formal name for food stamps. But with SNAP benefits set to halt in the next few days, Gabrielle finds herself stretching her family’s limited finances in order to fill her refrigerator.\n \n\n   \n  “SNAP benefits are a must right now,” she said, adding her fiancé’s workload has been slow and she’s currently out of work herself.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in online forums usually reserved for finding handyman recommendations and lost pets, or buying and selling gently used belongings, neighbors are stepping up for one another as “grocery buddies,” creating a patchwork solution for vulnerable families across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how it works: Neighbors post on social media in community groups or public forums about their willingness to be a “grocery buddy” and help a family at risk of losing SNAP benefits. The poster asks those interested to send them a private message. Together, they find a grocery solution that makes sense for both parties.\n \n\n   \n  Assistance may look different for each pairing: In some cases, “grocery buddies” do the shopping, while in others, they accompany one another to the supermarket and shop together. Some “grocery buddies” provide their counterparts gift cards, giving them agency and control in a time of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the grassroots effort has spread, as messages offering and seeking assistance are cut, copied and pasted throughout communities big and small, connecting neighbors and finding those in need tangible help.\n \n\n   \n  This week, faced with the prospect of losing SNAP assistance and the stress of the holidays around the corner, Gabrielle, a West Virginia resident, reluctantly raised her hand in a community Facebook group.\n \n\n   \n  “I kind of almost didn’t want to comment because I knew other people were going to see it,” Gabrielle said, adding she didn’t want to be judged based on her situation.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, she decided it was worth a shot if it meant helping her family.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s what I would want done for me’\n \n\n   \n  A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, SNAP provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of  $188 per person , as of May. But amid the government shutdown, the US Department of Agriculture has said it  doesn’t have the funds  to pay $8 billion in food stamp benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  When beneficiaries will feel the impact varies, since states typically provide the benefits on a rolling basis during the month. Some will miss their payments as soon as Saturday, while others won’t be hit until later in November.\n \n\n   \n  There aren’t many good alternatives: While Americans can turn to food pantries and other food assistance programs, recent years have seen these groups under pressure from rising food prices and increased need.\n \n\n   \n  “Now more than ever, community aid is going to be very important,” Micah Iverson, a resident of Hatteras Island, North Carolina, told CNN. “At the end of the day, we’re all on the same team here.”\n \n\n   \n  Iverson posted on Sunday about his desire to serve as a “grocery buddy” for someone in his tight-knit community. He was floored by the responses of people in need, he said, but also the willingness of others to help further his cause and donate additional funds.\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor of Iverson’s reached out to him on Facebook and connected him with his grocery buddy, a single mother of four. After a few messages were exchanged, the 31-year-old went to his local Food Lion and ticked away at the items on the mom’s grocery list.\n \n\n   \n  To pay, Iverson said he used a $300 gift card he won during office trivia, turning it into a fridge full of food.\n \n\n   \n  Later that evening, within hours of his initial post, Iverson was dropping off a trunk full of groceries to the mom after she got off work, he said. Upon meeting, the strangers – now friends – “hugged it out” as tears filled his eyes, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s what I would want done for me,” Iverson said, adding he and his husband plan on helping the same family﻿   as long as their own financial situation allows.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I encourage others to consider this if you can’\n \n\n   \n  Kristin Schmidt knows what it’s like to be hungry and on the receiving end of a wholesome meal. Now, she’s honored to be the one doing the giving.\n \n\n   \n  The minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Silver Spring, Maryland, told CNN she was inspired by a friend’s social media post looking for a “grocery buddy” and decided to do the same in a Facebook group for local moms.\n \n\n   \n  “If SNAP benefits run out in November, I would be happy to provide groceries for you and/or your family,” she wrote, adding, “I can only afford to take on one grocery buddy, but I encourage others to consider this if you can.”\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help from SNAP, according to the latest data from the US Department of Agriculture. That statistic haunted Schmidt, who said she would be unable to sleep at night if she didn’t do something to help.\n \n\n   \n  Her motivation “comes out of a deep, core belief in the preciousness of every single person,” she said, “and wanting to make sure that the people in my neighborhood have what they need – just as a basic human right.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few days, the mother of three was overwhelmed by the number of comments on her original post. And she said she was inundated with messages from other people wanting to offer help to their neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting and connecting in person, Schmidt said she plans to continue supporting her new “grocery buddy” – a disabled grandmother relying on SNAP to feed her grandson – through supermarket gift cards.\n \n\n   \n  “My community would be less if she didn’t get the support that she needs,” Schmidt said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Gabrielle hasn’t yet found a “grocery buddy” to help with her family’s immediate needs.\n \n\n   \n  But she remains hopeful – and grateful that, through another community Facebook post, she was connected with a neighbor who offered to cover her family’s Thanksgiving meal.\n \n\n   \n  For now, she said, that’s one less worry on her plate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/obamacare-premiums-increase-2026-coverage","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:46:00Z","title":"Obamacare enrollees get first look at 2026 prices as premiums soar","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Obamacare enrollees are facing a major financial shock as premiums are expected to rise by an average of 26% nationally in 2026, with even steeper increases in some states like New Jersey and Colorado due to the expiration of enhanced premium subsidies.

7:46 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Premiums for Affordable Care Act coverage will skyrocket 26%, on average, next year, according to a KFF analysis released Tuesday evening, just days before open enrollment starts on November 1.\n \n\n   \n  The price hike is one of the largest jumps since Obamacare plans debuted more than a decade ago — and it doesn’t factor in the  expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Consumers in the 30 states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, can now get a preview of what they’ll pay for 2026 coverage. The site opened for so-called window shopping on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The monthly premium for the benchmark plan on healthcare.gov will soar 30%, on average, according to the KFF analysis, which is based on data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In states that run their own exchanges, the benchmark plan premium will rise by an average of 17%.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s not all the bad news: The actual amount enrollees pay in 2026 will be far, far higher because the enhanced premium subsidies will disappear. Their monthly payments are expected to more than double, according to a separate analysis from KFF, a health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  Those window shopping on healthcare.gov will get a full sense of the sticker shock, many for the first time. The premiums on the site reflect the lapse of the enhanced assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Still, most enrollees will be able to find 2026 plans on the federal exchange with premiums at or below $50 a month, after factoring in the original Obamacare subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and not expiring, according to a CMS fact sheet.\n \n\n   \n  But the impact of the expiring enhanced assistance is clear: Nearly 60% of enrollees signing up for 2026 coverage can find plans in that price range, compared to 83% of consumers in 2025 plans.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration frequently touted that four out of five enrollees on the federal exchange could find plans for $10 or less in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The CMS fact sheet, which is the agency’s first release on 2026 open enrollment, did not mention the increase in insurers’ premium rates.\n \n\n   \n    Fight over extending the subsidies\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the beefed-up subsidies is at the  center of the battle on Capitol Hill  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown, which began October 1. Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Renewing the subsidies would cost $350 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n \n\n   \n  While the enhanced subsidies, known as premium tax credits, don’t expire until the end of the year, the damage will be done well before that, say Democrats and ACA advocates. Once consumers see much higher premiums, they may not return to sign up for coverage — even if lawmakers renew the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The only time premiums on the federal exchange increased even more was in 2018, after President Donald Trump eliminated federal support for Obamacare subsidies that help people pay for their  out-of-pocket costs . Premiums shot up by 37% that year, reflecting insurers’ uncertainty about the future of the landmark health reform law in the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n    Paying at least double\n \n\n   \n  Several states that run their own Obamacare exchanges have announced that premiums will at least double next year if the enhanced subsidies lapse.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, premiums will soar to more than $2,780 annually — a jump of more than 174%, on average — because of the enhanced subsidies’ expiration and insurers’ rate hike of 16.6%, according to the state’s Department of Banking and Insurance. About 60,000 enrollees in Get Covered New Jersey will completely lose federal assistance in paying their premiums in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers will soon be shopping and comparing health plans, and without these enhanced tax credits, they will be confronted by startlingly higher prices for coverage,” Commissioner Justin Zimmerman said in a statement. “We are significantly concerned that many households will be forced to choose plans with lesser coverage or choose no coverage at all as a result.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, enrollees in Connect for Health Colorado will see premiums increase an average of 101% next year, the state’s Division of Insurance announced. Roughly 75,000 residents will lose access to health coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Without the enhanced subsidies, a family of four living in the Denver area with an annual income of about $128,000 would no longer qualify for premium assistance and would see their annual premium bill soar by $14,000 for the standard silver plan.\n \n\n   \n  But if the more generous assistance is extended, the average increase for enrollees would be 16%.\n \n\n   \n    Record enrollment\n \n\n   \n  The  enhanced subsidies,  which a Democratic Congress approved in 2021 and extended the following year, have helped drive Obamacare sign-ups to a  record 24 million  for this year.\n \n\n   \n  Around 17 million people signed up for 2025 coverage on healthcare.gov.

About 4 million more people would be uninsured in 2034, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis — and that’s on top of the roughly  10 million more people  who will lack coverage due to the One Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/sport/basketball-nba-michael-jordan-load-management-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:33:00-04:00","title":"Michael Jordan Disapproves of ‘Load Management’ in Today’s Basketball and 3 Things You Missed from Tuesday’s NBA Action","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michael Jordan criticizes the growing trend of 'load management' in modern basketball, arguing that it is unnecessary and contrary to the spirit of competition, citing his own legendary performance through illness in the 1997 NBA Finals.

today’s basketball and 3 things you missed from Tuesday’s NBA action \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:33 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If there’s anyone who knows what it takes to win, it’s  Michael Jordan .\n \n\n   \n  Arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan won six  NBA  championships and five MVP awards during his storied spell with the Chicago Bulls.\n \n\n   \n  But looking at today’s landscape, Jordan isn’t overjoyed by the current trend of players missing games in order to protect their bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on Tuesday’s segment of “MJ: Insights to Excellence” on NBC, Jordan was asked for his opinion on “load management,” which is when a healthy player strategically misses a game in order to avoid injuries or prevent fatigue.\n \n\n   \n  “Well, it shouldn’t be needed, first and foremost,” Jordan said. “I never wanted to miss a game because it was an opportunity to prove. It was something that I felt like the fans are there that watch me play. I want to impress that guy way up on top who probably worked his (butt) off to get a ticket or to get money to buy the ticket.”\n \n\n   \n  Jordan highlighted his iconic “ Flu Game ” in the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz as an example of him going to extreme lengths to ensure he was on the court.\n \n\n   \n  Despite suffering apparent flu-like symptoms the night before and during the game, Jordan – through sheer strength of will and determination – scored 38 points to help his Chicago Bulls win 90-88 in Game 5 and put his Bulls one game away from the NBA title.\n \n\n   \n  “I was going to find a way to get out there, even if I was a decoy,” the 62-year-old said. “Well, once I got out there, you never know how – pushing yourself – you never know what happens, right?\n \n\n   \n  “Next thing you know, the emotions, the situation, the need of the team. All those things catapulted me to: ‘I’m going to gut this thing out.’”\n \n\n   \n  The league has gone to lengths to incentivize players to appear in as many games as possible during a season, including introducing criteria which disqualifies them from end-of-season awards if they don’t feature in enough games.\n \n\n   \n    Thunder stay unbeaten in title defense\n \n\n   \n  Around the league, there were five games played on Tuesday night, including the defending champions taking the floor to continue their lightning start to their title defense.\n \n\n   \n  The Oklahoma City Thunder stayed undefeated with a 107-101 victory over the Sacramento Kings at Paycom Center.\n \n\n   \n  Reigning MVP  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  led the way for the Thunder with 31 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three blocks, while Aaron Wiggins and Ajay Mitchell both added 18 points.\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who slip to 1-3 with the loss, led at halftime and even held a seven-point advantage in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But some key buckets down the stretch from Oklahoma City put the champs in front with just 2:33 left in the game as they improve to 5-0 and continue to show why they’re still the team to beat in the NBA this season.\n \n\n   \n    Antetokounmpo outduels Brunson in potential East playoff preview\n \n\n   \n  The Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks have been two of the Eastern Conference’s heavyweights in recent years, and Tuesday’s clash showed why they could be set for a playoff meeting later in the season.\n \n\n   \n  The two met at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee and the two stars on display – Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks and Jalen Brunson of the Knicks – shone brightly.\n \n\n   \n  Antetokounmpo had 37 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and two blocks while Brunson had 36 points on 56% shooting from the field as Milwaukee erased a 12-point halftime deficit to win 121-111.\n \n\n   \n  It was a noteworthy victory for the Bucks who have struggled recently against the Knicks; New York had beaten Milwaukee five straight times before Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, the “Greek Freak” spoke about how meaningful the victory was as his Bucks improved to 3-1.\n \n\n   \n  “For sure, it was a lot extra,” Antetokounmpo told reporters. “They swept us last year. They swept us. They were better than us last year. We didn’t make it tough on them. It was very easy. As a leader of this team, I remember. I don’t forget things.”\n \n\n   \n  Milwaukee’s fourth quarter comeback came after a scary moment for the Knicks when Brunson appeared to injure his groin when scrambling for a loose ball.\n \n\n   \n  He remained in the game but moved gingerly and, just seconds later, he fell backwards in clear pain, causing a turnover which Antetokounmpo turned into a dunk at the other end to level the score.\n \n\n   \n  Brunson played out the loss, but his injury status is uncertain.\n \n\n   \n    Warriors beat Clippers with defensive masterclass\n \n\n   \n  The Golden State Warriors have begun the new season strongly and kept it rolling with a convincing 98-79 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n \n\n   \n  The Warriors leaned on their stifling defense for the victory, holding the Clippers to 36.6% shooting from the floor and 18.2% from beyond the arc; Draymond Green had three steals and Steph Curry had two.\n \n\n   \n  With that defensive structure providing a platform, Golden State’s stars performed on the offensive end, with Jimmy Butler pouring in 21 points and Curry adding 19.\n \n\n   \n  “Challenging every shot, keeping them off the free throw line,” Butler said of the team’s defensive effort. “It always helps to make shots so we can get back in transition.\n \n\n   \n  “Guys are confident, happy, playing some great basketball.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday, the Warriors had lost their last seven games to the Clippers. They improve to 4-1 with the win while the Clippers fall to 2-2.\n \n\n   \n  In the victory, Butler surpassed the 16,000-point mark in the NBA, doing so in his 15th season in the league.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/28/africa/sudan-rsf-takes-el-fasher-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"10:28:00-20:00","title":"Bloodbath feared as rebels trap thousands in Sudan city","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The RSF has captured El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, after a prolonged conflict with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), marking a turning point in the civil war.

How did we get here and what might come next? \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:28 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sudanese rebels have driven government forces from El Fasher, the last stronghold of the country’s regime in the western Darfur region, amid a brutal struggle for territory that has led to alleged genocide and contributed to one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has besieged El Fasher, its final major barrier to controlling Darfur. The RSF aims to establish a parallel government in the region. It has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for power since April 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Estimates suggest that  more than 150,000 people have died  due to the conflict, while an additional 14 million have been displaced from their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Sudan’s army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is also the de facto head of state, acknowledged the rebels’ capture of El Fasher. In a  broadcast  on Monday, he stated that his troops retreated from the city due to the destruction and systematic killing of civilians.\n \n\n   \n  Justin Lynch, a Sudan researcher and managing director of Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and conflict monitoring organization, told CNN that the RSF’s capture of El Fasher marks “the beginning of what we fear to be a massacre of civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Tom Fletcher, the United Nations humanitarian chief, hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped in El Fasher, lacking food and health care. He  reported  that escape routes have been blocked amid “intense shelling and ground assaults” that “have engulfed the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has  claimed it is committed  to protecting civilians in El Fasher and providing safe corridors for those seeking to leave.\n \n\n   \n  However, the  UN Human Rights Office said  it had received “multiple, alarming reports” of the RSF committing atrocities including summary executions of civilians, and videos showing dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead surrounded by RSF fighters.\n \n\n   \n  It also cited “indications of ethnic motivations for killings.”\n \n\n   \n  According to Jalale Getachew Birru, a senior analyst at the crisis-monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), there is a “high risk of ethnically targeted attacks, particularly against non-Arab groups.”\n \n\n   \n  Between April 2023 and mid-October 2025, her organization documented 390 incidents of violence against civilians in El Fasher and surrounding areas, resulting in over 1,300 reported fatalities, along with 180 attacks on internally displaced persons (IDPs) that caused at least 830 deaths.\n \n\n   \n  Ethnically motivated killings have been a feature of the conflict from its outset, particularly in Darfur. The region experienced some of its worst ethnic violence in 2023, with hundreds of individuals from non-Arab ethnic groups  massacred  by the RSF and forces linked to it.\n \n\n   \n    How did we get here?\n \n\n   \n  For the past 30 months, army leader al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads the RSF, have been fighting over control of Sudan.\n \n\n   \n  These two men, once allies and among the most powerful generals in the country, jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from power in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  They also played significant roles in a  subsequent coup in 2021  when al-Burhan seized control from Sudan’s transitional government.\n \n\n   \n  Both generals have faced Western sanctions due to their involvement in war crimes. However, Dagalo’s RSF, along with its allied Arab militias, has been  accused by the United States of committing genocide  during the ongoing civil war. This marks the second time in two decades that the US has declared genocide in Sudan.\n \n\n   \n  The US government said when making the declaration in January that the RSF had executed “direct attacks against civilians,” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, it said, they had “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” and “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Sudan’s military government has  accused the United Arab Emirates  of supplying weapons to the RSF, although the UAE has denied this.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the RSF?\n \n\n   \n  The RSF is a paramilitary group with an  estimated 100,000 fighters , approximately  half the size of the SAF .\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has a history tied to ethnically-driven violence.\n \n\n   \n  The group emerged from the Arab Janjaweed militia, which was responsible for the genocide in Darfur during the early 2000s. That resulted in an estimated 300,000 deaths.\n \n\n   \n  The recent killings in El Fasher and other areas of Darfur reflect a pattern of targeted violence similar to that seen during the earlier genocide.\n \n\n   \n  According to Lynch, the RSF’s takeover of El Fasher will “only mean more misery for civilians.”\n \n\n   \n    Why is El Fasher’s capture significant, and what might happen next?\n \n\n   \n  The RSF’s seizure of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, represents a significant turning point that allows the group to strengthen its hold on the broader Darfur region, according to Birru.\n \n\n   \n  It comes in the wake of the SAF  regaining control of the country’s capital , Khartoum, from the RSF earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Fighting is now expected to shift to the central and oil-rich Kordofan region, which borders Darfur, according to Birru.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF  announced  on Saturday it had taken Bara, a crucial transport hub in North Kordofan state that connects the strategic town to the rest of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “In Kordofan, the SAF and its allies are seeking to secure key routes connecting central Sudan to the Darfur region, while the RSF is working to consolidate control across both regions to rein in its alternative government in western Sudan,” Birru said.\n \n\n   \n  “The outcome of battles in El Fasher and Kordofan will likely determine the future trajectory of Sudan’s conflict and the country’s political future,” she added, amid a global push for a ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  International human rights lawyer Yonah Diamond told CNN that the international community must intervene as violence escalates in Sudan and civilian casualties increase in El Fasher, asking whether world leaders would allow the RSF “to commit another genocide in Darfur with impunity.”\n \n\n   \n  “The time for emergency action is right now – to end the bloodshed, open humanitarian corridors, and protect the people of El Fasher and what’s left of any global conscience,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/ubs-third-quarter-profits-soar-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:03:00-04:00","title":"Profits soar for UBS in third quarter, exceeding expectations","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"UBS reported a 74% year-over-year increase in net profit to $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, surpassing market expectations, driven by heightened financial market volatility and a surge in M&A activity.

this year and its financial targets for 2026.

The bank has no plans to make any provisions in relation to the case, UBS said.\n \n\n   \n  Net profit came in at $2.5 billion. That trumped a consensus estimate of $1.29 billion and marked its best result since one-off factors related to the integration of former rival Credit Suisse led to a profit of over $27 billion in the second quarter of 2023.\n \n\n   \n  A release of legal provisions worth $688 million also contributed to the earnings beat. They were mainly related to the resolution of Credit Suisse’s residential mortgage-backed securities business and a UBS case in France.\n \n\n   \n  UBS attracted $38 billion in net new money to its global wealth management division and $18 billion to asset management, bringing total invested assets close to $7 trillion.\n \n\n   \n  Strong inflows from Asia more than offset outflows in the Americas, where UBS this week applied for a US banking license.\n \n\n   \n  In UBS’s investment banking division, revenues jumped 52% year-on-year in global banking and 14% in trading, marking a record third quarter for both these business areas as deal-making activity resumed.\n \n\n   \n  Integration of Credit Suisse further progressed, UBS said, adding that over two-thirds of Swiss-booked client accounts have been migrated.\n \n\n   \n  Citi analysts wrote in a note that while UBS had delivered a strong set of results, there was still a lack of clarity surrounding its future business model given pressure within Switzerland on the bank to increase its core capital levels by some $24 billion – a measure aimed at protecting the country should the bank run into difficulties.\n \n\n   \n  The bank, which has been lobbying to soften those requirements, said it would continue to contribute to the debate on banking regulation in Switzerland without providing further detail.\n \n\n   \n  Reuters reported last month that Switzerland and UBS are, in private, signaling a willingness to compromise on capital rules, potentially paving the way for parliament to settle on lower requirements acceptable to the government and the bank.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590945","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:46:00-04:00","title":"Trial Set Over NPR Allegations That CPB Yielded to White House Pressure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NPR has sued the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) over a sudden reversal in April 2025 of a long-standing contract to manage public radio satellite and distribution services, which NPR alleges was driven by political pressure from the Trump administration.

It is another marker of the Trump administration's disruptive force throughout the media. NPR alleges that CPB unlawfully yanked away a planned three-year contract worth $36 million in the face of intense pressure from the White House to sever ties with the radio network. In a court hearing on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss had indicated a deep skepticism of CPB's argument that it  sharply reversed course  this spring on the merits as NPR presented more evidence it sought to appease the administration. The most plausible explanation, Moss said, was that CPB was hoping to survive. The CPB is the nonprofit that funneled federal dollars to public media until this month, as Congress and the president acted this summer to halt all $1.1 billion in planned future subsidies. Only a skeleton crew remains at the corporation. President Trump had been in the White House barely two months when he began attacking NPR and its TV counterpart PBS on social media as \"radical left MONSTERS.\" On May 1, he followed up with an  executive order to stop all federal dollars  from going to them. In response,  NPR and three member stations in Colorado sued  both the Trump administration and CPB, alleging their First Amendment rights were being violated. The portion of the lawsuit headed to trial does not involve the subsidies, but a separate contract to provide satellite and distribution services for public radio stations. NPR has operated it for four decades under a series of contracts with CPB. A rush to get a deal, then a change of heart In late March, CPB had heard rumors of the possibility of an executive order against public media but were uncertain what form it would take. With that in mind, on April 2, CPB's board authorized its officials to work out the fine print of a fresh contract with NPR. A top CPB official, Kathy Merritt called NPR's executive overseeing the satellite and distribution system and told him not to trip up the negotiations over minor matters, citing the urgency to get the money approved. (Merritt affirmed this account during a sworn deposition last week.) The next day, at an in-person meeting, a top White House budget official told CPB's board chairperson and two senior executives of her \"intense dislike for NPR.\" Memoranda about the meeting reflect the White House official, Katie Sullivan, also said \"it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water,\" according to legal documents NPR filed in court. The day after that, on April 4, CPB's board reversed itself, deciding that the radio satellite and distribution system had to be operated by an entity separate from NPR. CPB asked NPR to come up with plans to spin off the division, court filings show; NPR declined but bid for the project nonetheless. Behind the scenes, CPB's chairperson, Ruby Calvert, was \"adamant that she doesn't want funding to go to NPR,\" according to an April 12 email from Merritt to a colleague brought to light in the litigation. \"Something has been fundamentally missing\" On April 13, CPB's chief of staff, Debra Sanchez, wrote that she wasn't sure how to explain the requirement that it spin off its satellite and distribution system, called PRSS, court documents show. \"Something has been fundamentally missing for me ... and it's the 'because' statement,\" she wrote to colleagues. \"In particular, the 'local stations would be better served by having PRSS as an independent entity' which begs the question... because?\" Newly hired Republican consultant Carl Forti advised CPB on key themes to embrace in dealing with the administration: \"CPB has taken proactive steps to rein in what it sees as bias at NPR and PBS,\" according to court filings. The consultant stated that CPB should stress it had \"already taken steps to address the administration's concerns\" including by \"[w]ithholding interconnection funds from NPR.\" The word \"interconnection\" is a shorthand for the satellite and distribution system. Forti's memo also stated that CPB should note it had stopped a grant supporting NPR's international reporting and for newsroom support. CPB had subsidized a new senior editorial review team last year after allegations of bias led to criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Clayton Barsoum, CPB's chief lobbying executive, affirmed the memo in a note to Sanchez, writing, \"This looks good to me,\" court filings show. CPB argues it is a bulwark against political pressure In September, the corporation announced it was awarding a longer, bigger contract — $57 million over five years — to a new consortium that includes major public radio stations, a public radio distributor and an industry consulting firm. It said it was doing so to address long-standing concerns about NPR's performance. CPB's attorney, Joseph D. Lipschitz, argued that the corporation has acted as a resolute bulwark for public media, including NPR, against political pressure. He noted that  CPB had separately sued Trump  over his attempt to fire corporation board members. In his remarks, Moss cast doubt on the credibility of that defense, repeatedly questioning the quick-twitch decision to demand that NPR no longer run the distribution system after such a longstanding arrangement. \"All of a sudden there was this change. And so what happened to cause this change?\" the judge asked. \"I have to say, the most plausible explanation for what's happening here, is that everything is not quite as linear as \"We're for or against it'.\" \"CPB is understandably trying to survive,\" Moss said. \"There are a lot of materials that are in the record here that say there are a lot of strategies going on: 'What do we do? One thing we do is distance ourselves from NPR, because they don't like NPR'.\" In that April memo reproduced in court filings, CPB's consultant Forti came up with a message to convey senators whom Trump was urging to pull all funding for public media: \"a. We understand the new world. \"b. We are responsive to the new world. \"c. We are trying to limit funds direct to NPR and PBS for biased content.\" Barsoum had endorsed the memo. Yet CPB officials felt they could not make that case publicly, evidence presented by NPR in court shows. Behind the scenes, CPB officials were asking Forti how they could best present their decision, without referring to the political firestorm around them. \"I don't think we are comfortable with the approach to publicly state we cut funding to NPR, so the bland statement might be where we land,\" Sanchez, the CPB chief of staff, wrote, according to materials filed in court. Moss ordered a brief expedited trial on this portion of the litigation. He will assess it himself, instead of a jury, in what is called a bench trial. It is expected to last three to four days.

The stock market crashed, and global financial systems lurched to the brink of collapse.

Firms like AIG placed massive risky bets with borrowed money.

This is called the private credit market. It has exploded in the past 15 years. It's now valued at around $2 trillion. But what happens if those loans aren't backed up? Natasha Sarin is president of the Yale Budget Lab. Natasha Sarin, welcome. NATASHA SARIN: Thanks so much for having me. KELLY: So you wrote a piece. This was for The New York Times, and the headline - which I loved - was \"How Bad Is Finance's Cockroach Problem? We Are About To Find Out.\" Unpack that for us. Who were the cockroaches in this scenario? SARIN: So the cockroach I can't take credit for because it comes from Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, as he was commenting on something that many of us who aren't deep in the finance industry may have even missed over the course of the last many weeks, which is that two auto-related firms went bankrupt over the course of a few weeks in September. That in and of itself is not necessarily all that interesting. They're relatively small firms. But what is kind of interesting and pretty important is that there are a lot of allegations of fraud associated with those two particular bankruptcies and a lot of concerns that after these firms failed, it turns out that they had borrowed much more money in ways that were ultimately pretty opaque and kind of hidden even from their own investors than people had previously realized. KELLY: So just take us step by step through this. You said these are two firms. Are they firms we've heard of? Who were they? And just tell me a tiny bit of the story. SARIN: Yeah. These are two auto-related firms. One is a company that is called Tricolor. Tricolor was a company that is one of the largest subprime auto lenders and used car retailers in Texas and California, and its business model is a lot about lending to people who either have no or very limited credit history. KELLY: OK. And what's the other one? SARIN: The other one is a company that's called First Brands, and you probably haven't heard of it, but they make all types of different car parts. KELLY: So we're not talking Ford. We're not talking GM. What is it that you see happening that has you so worried? SARIN: So one piece that's interesting is about the way they were ultimately borrowing. And it turns out that they were borrowing in part from traditional banks and public markets, but they were also borrowing in part from private markets and from these private credit firms. And importantly, when they ultimately went bankrupt, it had to do with learning more about the fact that these firms had allegedly committed fraud by doing things like offering the same collateral to multiple people who lend it to them. And that type of opacity, such that the lenders themselves didn't even realize how leveraged, how much borrowing these two particular firms had done, is a feature of what you can see happening these days in private credit markets. But because of regulation that we did in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it is happening much less in public markets and much less in banks. KELLY: OK. So we've mentioned the 2008 financial crisis a couple of times. What is it you see that feels the same as 2008? What is it you see that maybe is not parallel? Start with what's the same. SARIN: Yeah. And Andrew Bailey, who runs the central Bank of England, said anyone watching these two particular bankruptcies, like, alarm bells should be going off if they were anywhere near the 2008 financial crisis. We are starting to see the same kind of slicing and dicing of literally everything. Think car loans. Think leases on AI data centers. Think of bills that are owed from plastic surgery patients. Literally everything and turning it into allegedly relatively safe slices of financial securities. But the other piece is there, too. We're also starting to see really significant lending, and it's happening very substantially in these private credit markets. KELLY: So to things that should be different, should feel different from 2008, there were all these regulations and changes that went into effect to make sure we never had a meltdown like that. Why are these firms largely exempt from all those changes? SARIN: So in response to the financial crisis, we did a lot of regulating. And the result of that regulating was that traditional financial institution - so your bank - is doing a lot less of this risky lending than they were doing historically. Coming in to fill that void are these private credit firms, and the argument the private credit firms are making about their business model is actually they are better positioned to do this type of lending. And the reason they say that is because they're not reliant like banks are on bank depositors who can get flighty and get nervous and then ultimately flee and lead to a bank run and then a cascade of bank runs that brings down the whole financial system. KELLY: So bottom line, how worried are you about these private credit firms? SARIN: I think in some sense, it's a little bit early innings for us. The thing that I'm always nervous about is - you know, what happened in the aftermath of the financial crisis is we took important steps to bring under the regulatory umbrella a lot of lending that ultimately turned out to be riskier and more damaging than we had previously anticipated. And it's sort of concerning that you see these private credit firms themselves, as they advertise themselves, explicitly saying an advantage that they have is they're not subject to those regulations and they're not subject to those types of improved prudential standards. And so I'm pretty nervous that if you have a bunch of financial activity that's ultimately happening in the shadows, eventually, once we get a downturn and when invariably the economy worsens, you're going to be in a situation where those private credit firms - which, by the way, are reliant on money from ordinary people, just like banks because they're heavily reliant on things like premiums from insurance companies that they purchase - they're going to be in a situation where losses on the financial markets and losses by these financial credit firms are ultimately going to fall to regular people. KELLY: Let me put to you a counterargument. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, he has a very different take. He says, \"the growth of private credit shows that financial regulations after 2008 are too tight\" (ph) - direct quote. He says we need to make capital more risk-based. What's wrong with that argument? SARIN: I think the challenge with that argument is it in some sense ignores the history that we have well experienced over the course of not just the last financial crisis that we had in this country, but every financial crisis that has existed in this country and in other countries, which is ultimately when you're in a situation where you have too much leverage in a system and financial institutions that are ultimately incredibly interconnected. And that, by the way, is the case even with these private credit firms because now you're starting to see banks invest in these private credit firms. And so it's in some sense, like, despite their being not directly the originators of this new risk-lending, they're still tied in to this whole pool of potential risk. And so while I'm sympathetic to the idea that by regulating one sector of the financial market you've had risk go in to other sectors, my response to that isn't we should deregulate a sector. My response to that is we need to think about how we have a regulatory umbrella that is more all-encompassing of the types of activities that are happening all over our financial system. KELLY: How much are ordinary people at risk of being caught up in all this? 2008 was about a lot of things, but among it was ordinary people's mortgages. I know you have been thinking about 401(k)s potentially down the road being caught up in this private credit - the riskiness that you see. SARIN: Totally. And you saw over the course of just the last few months a loosening with respect to the possibility that 401(k)s can be invested in some of these alternative asset classes and in private credit in ways that they haven't been historically. And you're also seeing private credit - in some sense, when you hear the word private credit, you think private. KELLY: Right. SARIN: And so it sounds different to you than a bank or public markets. But the challenge is where is private credit ultimately getting the dollars that are coming its way to invest? And those dollars are coming from things like pension funds. Those dollars are coming from things like private equity firms buying insurance companies. And when you buy an insurance company, you owe money to ordinary people - the policyholders of that insurance company. And so a little bit what makes me nervous about this moment is I do not think ordinary people or even very sophisticated academics who consider these questions or really anyone outside of these private credit firms has a full understanding of the ways in which the market is ultimately connected to the rest of the financial system. As a result, ordinary people's dollars are on the line just like they were in 2008. KELLY: So what can we do? As we see the train coming down the tracks, what can be done now by the government, by Congress, by the administration to try to prevent it from going off the rails? SARIN: Now, one thing that gives you a little bit of optimism about this moment and a little bit of hope that we won't find ourselves in exactly the same type of crisis that we have historically is exactly this point about the matching of incentives. So private credit firms themselves are incredibly incentivized to do lots of diligence about the types of lending that's happening at their particular firm and to try and understand the nature of the interconnected indebtedness that we've been describing. And so it's not really, in my view, that the idea that these incentives are well-aligned. That's good. And in fact, you saw some private credit firms actually short exactly these two auto-related firms because they had some suspicions based on their understanding of this market, which is very deep, that maybe all was not exactly right. But I don't think you can rely on the industry to self-regulate in that way. I think you really have to have a deep conversation about the fact that we've seen really rapid growth in a really constrained timespan in the private credit market, and Congress needs to think about ways in which to better regulate these markets. And we as sort of consumers need to do our own due diligence about the ways in which our dollars are ultimately exposed to potential risks down the road.

Here's what that would mean \n         By Geoff Brumfiel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:06 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump said on Thursday that  the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons again  for the first time in decades. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We've halted many years ago, but with others doing testing I think it's appropriate to do so,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. Experts say that the resumption of testing would be a major escalation and could upend the nuclear balance of power. \"I think a decision to resume nuclear testing would be extremely dangerous and would do more to benefit our adversaries than the United States,\" said Corey Hinderstein, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for Nuclear Peace. Here's what a test would involve, and why the president might be calling for one now. There's currently only one place America could test a nuke — near Las Vegas, Nevada The Nevada National Security Site , approximately 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is currently the only place where America could test a nuclear weapon, says Robert Peters, a senior research fellow for strategic deterrence at the Heritage Foundation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Nevada site is around 1,300 square miles in size, larger than the state of Rhode Island. Starting in the 1950s, scientists conducted atmospheric nuclear tests at the site, but from 1962 to 1992, testing was done underground. Today, testing would likely be done in \"a complex of deep underground mineshafts,\" Peters said. Scientists dig a deep shaft either directly below ground or into the side of a mountain. They then put a nuclear device in a chamber at the end of the shaft and seal it up. The detonation is contained by the rock, reducing the risk of atmospheric fallout. Although underground testing is far safer than atmospheric testing, it still carries risks, said Hinderstein. In the past, some radioactive fallout has leaked from test shafts. Additionally, the test could shake buildings as far away as Las Vegas, and Hinderstein said some of the newer buildings in Vegas could even be at risk of damage. \"All of these big highrises — including Stratosphere, including the Trump Hotel,\" she said. \"They're not designed for massive, significant seismic activity.\" America's last test in Nevada was over 30 years ago At the end of the Cold War, the nation's major nuclear powers declared a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. Russia, then the Soviet Union, tested its last nuclear weapon in 1990, the U.S. conducted its final test in 1992, and China conducted its last test in 1996. The voluntary test moratorium has been in place as part of an effort to maintain nuclear stability. The U.S currently uses scientific experiments and supercomputer simulations to make sure its bombs still work. Last year, NPR was one of a handful of organizations granted  rare access  to the top-secret underground tunnels where the tests take place. Scientists working in the tunnels said they were confident they could continue to ensure the safety of America's nuclear weapons without testing. Although a full-scale nuclear detonation would be \"complementary\" to current experiments, \"our assessment is that there are no system questions that would be answered by a test, that would be worth the expense and the effort and the time,\" Don Haynes, a nuclear weapons scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory told NPR as they walked through the tunnels. Indeed Hinderstein says, preparing for a nuclear test is no small matter. While a basic demonstration test could be done in approximately 18 months. Conducting a test that would produce scientifically useful data would likely take years. Trump's announcement is likely reacting to some recent tests by Russia On Sunday,  Russia announced  it had conducted a successful test of a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then on Wednesday President Vladimir Putin announced the successful test of another doomsday weapon —  a nuclear-powered underwater drone , which Russia says can be used to attack coastal cities. Trump never called out Russia by name, but he did suggest recent testing was behind the announcement. \"I see them testing,\" he said aboard Air Force One, \"and I say, 'Well if they're going to test I guess we have to test.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While testing nuclear-powered weapons is not the same as testing nuclear weapons themselves, Russia's tests are highly provocative. They come just months before the expiration of the last nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia, designed to put limits on their arsenals. The back-and-forth has all the hallmarks of the start of an arms race, noted Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation for American Scientists. \"We saw this play out throughout the Cold War through nuclear testing, nuclear deployments, nuclear investments,\" he said. Many experts warn that now is not the time to resume nuclear testing Hinderstein, who served as a deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for America's nuclear weapons, from 2021-2024, said that a decision to resume testing would not be in America's interests. At the end of the Cold War, the U.S. had conducted more than a thousand nuclear tests — far more than any other nation (China, by comparison had conducted just 45). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Other nations, \"have more to gain by resuming nuclear testing than the United States does,\" she said. Testing would likely be expensive adds Paul Dean, vice president for global nuclear policy at the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \"The cost estimates I've seen have been at around, ballpark, $140 million per test,\" he said. \"It's not necessary to conduct a nuclear explosive test right now\" agreed Robert Peters of the Heritage Foundation. But he added. \"But there very well be compelling reasons to test in the coming months and years. That's how bad things are getting.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95189","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00.000Z","title":"First Confirmed Case of New Influenza Strain in Chinese City","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new strain of influenza has been identified in a Chinese city, marking the first confirmed case of this variant.

Here's what that means in your state \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 3:40 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown continues without an end in sight. In just a few days, tens of millions of people are at risk of losing federal food and nutrition benefits as a result. This includes the nearly 42 million people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The Trump administration has warned that the debit-like EBT cards will not be refilled and that the program  will run out of money on Nov. 1. SNAP, the country's largest anti-hunger program, dates back to the Great Depression and has never been disrupted this way. Most recipients are seniors, families with kids and people with disabilities. Individual states handle the distribution, while the federal government provides the funds and infrastructure that power the debit-like cards. Are you worried about your SNAP benefits?  NPR wants to hear your story In a letter dated Oct. 10, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift  money from its contingency fund and other places  to keep SNAP at least partially funded. It contends the USDA has a legal obligation to do so since SNAP is an entitlement program. But the USDA rejects that argument, stating in a memo Friday that its contingency funds are \"not legally available\" to extend regular benefits and are meant only for \"natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods.\" Read more:  'The helpers need help'. Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms Now, as November looms, states are trying to sort what options they can offer beneficiaries to fill the gap in food assistance. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR  Reporters from the NPR Network are covering the impact of this potential lapse in states across the country. Here's what we know so far. Some states are trying filling the gap A handful of states and territories are pulling from local funding to backfill the SNAP benefits for their communities. Officials in  Connecticut ,  Guam ,  Louisiana ,  Virginia , and  Vermont . have found ways to fund the program from anywhere from a few days into November to the whole month.  Because the federal government usually manages getting the funds to recipients, delays in some regions are expected as officials navigate technical and logistical hurdles for the first time. Others, like  South Carolina ,  Hawaii  and  Massachusetts , are leaning on relief funds or launching new ones to provide support for those who would usually count on SNAP.  In addition, some states, like  Minnesota , are sending funds to food bank systems in their region. — Emily Alfin Johnson, NPR Several Democratic-led states are suing the USDA  A coalition of more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general and governors are suing the Trump administration over its decision to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. The lawsuit,  filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts  Tuesday, comes as the White House continues to  blame Democrats  for the termination of food benefits for low-income Americans during the government shutdown. —  Stephen Fowler,  NPR State-specific impacts:  Alabama Roughly  749,000 people participate  in SNAP in Alabama, according to the USDA.  Alabama's Department of Human Resources (DHR), the agency responsible for SNAP in the state,  says on its website that  individuals can still apply for SNAP benefits during the suspension and DHR will continue to process applications and determine eligibility. Benefits will not be issued until the suspension is lifted. Current SNAP recipients, however, \"must continue to recertify their benefits, report as they normally would, and submit all documentation that would normally be required for them to continue in the program,\" DHR says. This is necessary so that each SNAP recipient can more quickly use their November funds in the grocery stores. Alaska Roughly  66,000 people participate  in SNAP in Alaska, according to the USDA.  Alaskans will not receive SNAP benefits for November, according to the state Division of Public Assistance, unless the federal government shutdown ends before then. [ Alaska Public Media ] Officials say the division will continue adding SNAP beneficiaries during the shutdown and Alaskans who lost food because of Typhoon Halong in western Alaska can apply to get October SNAP benefits re-issued. Michelle DeWitt, executive director of Bethel Community Services Foundation, said the state's formal food security safety nets are already stretched thin in the wake of the early October storm. [ Alaska Public Media ] Arizona More than  887,000 people participate  in SNAP in Arizona, according to the USDA.  The Arizona Department of Economic Security, which administers SNAP in the state, is directing Arizona SNAP recipients to local food banks if they need immediate food assistance. Food banks in Arizona can be found through the  Arizona Food Bank Network . [ KJZZ ] Arkansas Roughly  236,000 people participate  in SNAP in Arkansas, according to the USDA.  Arkansas' Department of Human Services  says SNAP beneficiaries  should prepare for a delay or disruption in November benefits, according to an Oct. 22 post on the agency website. The agency is awaiting further guidance from USDA. On X , Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoed Republican talking points, blaming Democrats for the shutdown and the impact on SNAP beneficiaries in her state.   She wrote Monday,  \"SNAP doesn't just serve families - it helps small town grocery stores too. But 2,700 Arkansas retailers soon won't be able to serve SNAP-recipient customers because of the Democrat's shutdown. Democrats need to do their job and stop punishing families and small businesses.\" Arkansas' DHS is pushing SNAP recipients to find local food pantries, churches and other organizations for temporary food assistance and to check for eligibility of other food programs.  California Over  5.5 million people participate in CalFresh  — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. Well over 1 million people in LA County. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh,  according to state data . [ LAist ] Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Oct. 22 that he would deploy the California National Guard to support food banks across California as the federal government shutdown drags on.

Jared Polis said 600,000 Coloradans, half of whom are children, won't get SNAP benefits on Nov. 1. Polis warned that state funding would not be nearly enough to offset the federal SNAP delay. [ Colorado Public Radio ] As the Nov. 1 date nears, food banks and county health services have been preparing for a delay in the federal program and increased crowds needing assistance.

On average, premiums are up 55% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Almost all of that increase came between 2022 and 2024.) Why has the price gone up? Cars  are more expensive;  parts and repairs  are more expensive;  medical bills  following auto accidents are more expensive. Modern cars are packed with pricey electronics, pushing up the cost of fixing even minor fender benders, while empty streets during the pandemic encouraged speeding and led to more severe (and more expensive) crashes. All those things cost insurers money. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Patty Kuderer is the insurance commissioner for the state of Washington; when insurance companies want to raise premiums, they need to ask her office for approval. \"The claims paid really drive the cost of the premiums,\" she says. And when companies bring her proof of the higher amounts they're paying out — like they have in recent years — she's required by law to approve those increases. But those price hikes may finally be about to top out. \"The good news is that, largely, the industry is caught up on premiums, and we're now starting to see companies reduce costs and compete for business,\" says Bob Passmore, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the trade group that represents insurers. Insurance companies had strong profits last year, and price hikes have stabilized. \"We may have seen the worst of it,\" he says. With one caveat: There's a six-to-12-month delay between when the insurance companies get hit by higher costs and when they're passed along to consumers, as companies assess their actual costs and get approval from regulators like Kuderer. Price hikes in the near term — caused by tariffs or other factors — could push up premiums again in the future. What are people doing about it? Shopping around, for one thing: Data analytics company LexisNexis reports that drivers are shopping around for policies at the highest rate since 2020, when the company started tracking. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Another thing they're doing: suffering. In  a recent survey  by LendingTree, more than 58% of drivers said their car insurance is a financial burden; more than half said they have cut back on other expenses to be able to afford their premium; more than a third said they avoid filing claims to keep their premium low. And more than a third of respondents said they have driven at some point  without  car insurance — which is illegal in every state except New Hampshire. The percentage of drivers on the road without insurance rose from 12.4% to 15.4% between 2018 and 2023, according to the  Insurance Research Council. \"I just couldn't afford it\": Driving uninsured  Zoe, a pastry chef in Pennsylvania, understands the importance of car insurance better than most. A few years ago, she had only the bare minimum insurance on her Toyota when an accident financially devastated her. Without insurance that would replace her undrivable vehicle, she was left carless, with an hourlong commute. Her savings were entirely wiped out. When she was able to replace her vehicle, she made sure to get full-coverage insurance at $230 a month. But it was a tight squeeze to cover it, and then her rent increased by $400. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We're only using Zoe's first name because, for a short time after that, she became one of those people driving without insurance. \"I fully didn't pay my car insurance bill for about four weeks just because I couldn't afford it,\" Zoe says. \"We have to eat every week. You have to pay the power and the water bill and the rent, and the rent keeps going higher, and milk's $4 a gallon.\" Zoe was acutely aware of the risks she was taking if she were to get in a crash or pulled over. \"I slow down at every single intersection, regardless of whether the light was green or not,\" she recalls with a heavy sigh. \"I'm careful at every turn. I get worried.\" She ultimately scraped together the funds to get her coverage back. But it costs extra to reinstate coverage after it lapses, one reason among many why insurance advisers strongly advise against letting that happen. \"The upfront costs of buying insurance in the first place are very, very high,\" says Rob Bhatt, an auto insurance expert with LendingTree. \"But then the cost of not having insurance potentially can be a lot higher. It's a really tough thing to balance.\" Cutting back and paring down ... Experts are increasingly recommending that drivers price out insurance costs before they purchase new vehicles. Otherwise, the sticker shock can be painful. Brandy Levene, in Yakima, Wash., replaced her older vehicle with a 2018 Acura RDX and was stunned to see her insurance bill clock in at $500 a month. She had to cut back elsewhere to pay the bill. \"Normally, especially during the summer, we've gone to stay in a hotel and go out of town, maybe go to another state for a couple of days,\" she says. That all got put on hold. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then she shopped around. By switching providers, she managed to bring that bill down to $190 a month. That's still more than $2,000 a year. She remembers when her car insurance cost less than she spent on gasoline. Now, she says, insurance is more than gas and car maintenance put together. And, she says with frustration, \"I'm not benefiting anything from it because I don't ever file a claim. So it's like I'm just paying this $190, I guess, to prevent from getting a ticket?\" Shannon Martin, an insurance expert with Bankrate, says that, to make matters worse, the rising costs of repairs mean that many people are likely now  under insured, meaning their insurance might not pay out as much as they'd need if they were in an accident. \"There's a feeling that you're paying more and you're getting less. And that's because you honestly are,\" Martin says. In fact, while she knows it's unwelcome advice, Martin says it would probably be a good idea to pay a little extra to  increase  the limits on a plan that was set up a few years ago, to make sure that any potential future payouts can keep up with your real expenses. … and postponing teenage driving Martin has a few tips on saving on insurance. Shop around, of course. For married couples, whoever has better credit should set up the policy. And, she says, \"if you have kids in the household, that means you're going to have teen drivers at some point. We don't have to give kids driver's licenses when they turn 16. That's our choice.\" That choice recently struck home for Levene. Her 17-year-old son, Josiah, has his license, and a family member has a car they'd be willing to pass down to him. But … \"I went through the process to see what it would cost to add him, and they told me it would be $350 a month,\" Levene says. \"And I'm like, 'Oh, I can't do this … that's so much money.'\" Levene would like it if she didn't have to drive her son to school — and Josiah would certainly love to have a set of wheels. \"Just to go somewhere outside of Yakima,\" he says wistfully. \"Just not being in this cycle where I'm just stuck in this town, stuck with the same life, stuck in the same living situation.\" But until he can get a job to cover that insurance bill himself, stuck is exactly what he is. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1199885876","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-04:00","title":"A flight expert's hot take on holiday travel: 'Don't do it'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Flight expert Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, advises against holiday travel during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Eve due to overcrowding, high prices, and flight disruptions.

Airports are packed, tickets are expensive and bad weather can cause significant flight delays and cancellations.  So, if you  have  to travel, is there an optimal time to do so? Scott Keyes, founder of the travel site  Going.com  (formerly known as Scott's Cheap Flights), shares his recommendations, including days to avoid and the best time of day to fly.  Don't travel ahead of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve \"It's one of the worst times to travel,\" he says, due to flight disruptions, crowds at the airport and ticket prices. \"My secret, best advice for travel over the holidays is: if at all possible, just don't do it.\"  If you have to fly for the holidays, do it on the day itself  \"You just see far fewer people traveling then,\" says Keyes. \"And with fewer people, you can see lower fares and fewer disruptions,\" including delays and cancellations. So think about booking tickets to depart or arrive on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Avoid peak travel days  For a lot of folks, the whole point of traveling during this time of year is to be with family on the  actual  holiday, says Keyes. \"The few days before and after a holiday are when you see the most crowds.\" For Thanksgiving, the busiest travel days are the Tuesday and Wednesday before the holiday and the Saturday and Sunday after, he says. For Christmas, it's between Dec. 20 to Jan. 5. A travel delay that stretches out over a few days, like a snowstorm, can quickly ruin a trip, he adds. \"That's when you're going to have the most competition with other travelers\" for a limited amount of seats if you're trying to rebook a flight.  To avoid this situation, Keyes recommends flying a few days before or after these peak travel times. So instead of flying on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, you might consider traveling a few days earlier.  Travel in January — the 8th, to be precise If you can wait, travel in January, says Keyes. You will probably have a much better flight experience.  Keyes even has a preferred date for that month: Jan. 8, he adds. \"It's my favorite date of the entire year. I circle that date on the calendar because whereas flight prices really get inflated over the Christmas-New Year period, around Jan. 8, they just fall off a cliff from the most expensive time of the entire year to the absolute cheapest.\"  \"It's not atypical to see airfares 80% lower on Jan. 10 compared to the same route on Dec. 30,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Take an early and direct flight  \"There are two types of flights that have the highest odds of getting you to where you're going on time or at least without a major delay: early morning flights and nonstop flights,\" says Keyes.  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's  Air Travel Consumer Report  for September, flights between 6-9 a.m. had an 86% on-time departure rate, versus 50% for flights between 8-11 p.m. With morning flights, \"your plane [has been] at the airport overnight. It's sitting there and ready to go when you get there in the morning,\" he says. Afternoon flights, on the other hand, depend on planes that are flying in from somewhere else and may be subject to delays.  Direct flights have the advantage of not having layovers. \"If you take a connecting flight that gets delayed an hour and a half but you only had a one-hour layover, all of a sudden you've missed your connecting flight and you have to get rebooked\" — not an easy feat during the holiday season.  Prepare yourself for potential flight disruptions that may keep you at the airport. Keyes likes to pack \"noise-canceling headphones and a little snack box, because frankly, airport food is not very memorable,\" he says. And he likes to download a few books and movies to his iPad — \"just in case I'm having to hang out at the airport longer than expected.\"  The audio was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

These shipments began arriving in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas after the snapback mechanism was triggered in September, following a 12-day conflict with Israel that destroyed a significant portion of Iran’s missile stockpiles. The deliveries are coordinated through a network of vessels, often operated by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, with many ships and associated companies based in Dalian, China. While sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the sanctions, experts argue it falls under broader restrictions on materials used in missile development. China, which previously opposed the sanctions, maintains that it operates within its international obligations and sovereignty, and may view the shipments as a matter of independent policy rather than a violation. The activity reflects a strategic pause in hostilities, as all parties seek to rearm — with Iran aiming to rebuild lost missile capacity and the US and Israel preparing to replenish their defense systems. This situation underscores growing tensions between diplomatic efforts and military rearmament, especially in the context of China's dual role as both a key economic partner to Iran and a critic of

10:31 AM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Following a similar route, the Barzin traveled from Gaolan on October 2 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 16, before leaving for China again on October 21.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95189","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Political Shifts in the Region: A New Era of Inclusive Governance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Recent political developments indicate a shift towards more inclusive governance and improved public services.

Here's what that means in your state \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 3:40 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown continues without an end in sight. In just a few days, tens of millions of people are at risk of losing federal food and nutrition benefits as a result. This includes the nearly 42 million people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The Trump administration has warned that the debit-like EBT cards will not be refilled and that the program  will run out of money on Nov. 1. SNAP, the country's largest anti-hunger program, dates back to the Great Depression and has never been disrupted this way. Most recipients are seniors, families with kids and people with disabilities. Individual states handle the distribution, while the federal government provides the funds and infrastructure that power the debit-like cards. Are you worried about your SNAP benefits?  NPR wants to hear your story In a letter dated Oct. 10, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift  money from its contingency fund and other places  to keep SNAP at least partially funded. It contends the USDA has a legal obligation to do so since SNAP is an entitlement program. But the USDA rejects that argument, stating in a memo Friday that its contingency funds are \"not legally available\" to extend regular benefits and are meant only for \"natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods.\" Read more:  'The helpers need help'. Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms Now, as November looms, states are trying to sort what options they can offer beneficiaries to fill the gap in food assistance. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR  Reporters from the NPR Network are covering the impact of this potential lapse in states across the country. Here's what we know so far. Some states are trying filling the gap A handful of states and territories are pulling from local funding to backfill the SNAP benefits for their communities. Officials in  Connecticut ,  Guam ,  Louisiana ,  Virginia , and  Vermont . have found ways to fund the program from anywhere from a few days into November to the whole month.  Because the federal government usually manages getting the funds to recipients, delays in some regions are expected as officials navigate technical and logistical hurdles for the first time. Others, like  South Carolina ,  Hawaii  and  Massachusetts , are leaning on relief funds or launching new ones to provide support for those who would usually count on SNAP.  In addition, some states, like  Minnesota , are sending funds to food bank systems in their region. — Emily Alfin Johnson, NPR Several Democratic-led states are suing the USDA  A coalition of more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general and governors are suing the Trump administration over its decision to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. The lawsuit,  filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts  Tuesday, comes as the White House continues to  blame Democrats  for the termination of food benefits for low-income Americans during the government shutdown. —  Stephen Fowler,  NPR State-specific impacts:  Alabama Roughly  749,000 people participate  in SNAP in Alabama, according to the USDA.  Alabama's Department of Human Resources (DHR), the agency responsible for SNAP in the state,  says on its website that  individuals can still apply for SNAP benefits during the suspension and DHR will continue to process applications and determine eligibility. Benefits will not be issued until the suspension is lifted. Current SNAP recipients, however, \"must continue to recertify their benefits, report as they normally would, and submit all documentation that would normally be required for them to continue in the program,\" DHR says. This is necessary so that each SNAP recipient can more quickly use their November funds in the grocery stores. Alaska Roughly  66,000 people participate  in SNAP in Alaska, according to the USDA.  Alaskans will not receive SNAP benefits for November, according to the state Division of Public Assistance, unless the federal government shutdown ends before then.

Thursday afternoon, which could avoid a total cutoff of  federal food assistance  to 42 million Americans that is set to begin Saturday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has stated that benefits from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stamps, could  not continue to flow  due to the  federal government shutdown  which began nearly a month ago. \"The well has run dry,\" the USDA posted on  its website  last week. But Democratic governors and attorneys general from some two dozen states  sued the federal government  to keep the payments coming, arguing that SNAP is an entitlement that cannot be cut off. Doing so, they argue, would cause irreparable damage to millions of Americans, and to states that will be left to deal with the fallout. After an hour of arguments in Boston federal court, Judge Indiria Talwani suggested she was not buying the Trump administration's argument that it is legally barred from using a USDA emergency fund to keep the SNAP benefits coming. \"Congress put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency,\" Talwani said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's really clear to me that what Congress was trying to do was protect the American people,\" she said, and lawmakers intended to ensure that in the event of something like a shutdown, \"we're not going to make everyone drop dead because it's a political game someplace else.\" Even if the emergency fund is tapped for SNAP benefits, administration officials say the $5.5 billion falls short of the $9 billion needed to fully cover the whole month of November. They say recalculating and arranging for partial payments would be a logistical nightmare — and could take weeks. That means millions of Americans could still see some delay in the next benefit payment, and would receive less than usual. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587760","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"15:02:00-04:00","title":"Are you worried about your SNAP benefits?

The Saudi Maternity Hospital was a last refuge for the sick and injured in the besieged city, as fighting raged around them. Despite no electricity, shortages of supplies, and frequently coming under heavy shelling, medical staff kept going. \"They are heroes, honestly,\" said Dr Mohamed Faisal Elsheikh, a Sudanese medical doctor based in Manchester and a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network. \"They really work in a very difficult environment, they had no medical instruments, there's no any medicines over there, there's no electricity…and yet with all dedication and commitment…they saved as much as they could of people's lives.\" No longer. Since the city fell to the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday, the doctors have been kidnapped and reports have emerged of a massacre at the hospital. \"On 28 October, six health workers, four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist, were abducted,\" from the hospital, the World Health Organization said in a statement Wednesday. \"On the same day, more than 460 patients and their companions were reportedly shot and killed in the hospital.\" WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was \"deeply shocked\" and \"appalled\" by the massacre and called for health facilities, health workers and patients to be protected under international law. \"Prior to this latest attack, WHO has verified 185 attacks on health care in Sudan with 1204 deaths and 416 injuries of health workers and patients since the start of the conflict in April 2023,\" he said. Videos of the attack believed to have been filmed by RSF fighters themselves are circulating online. While they cannot be independently verified by NPR, they show militia men walking through the ransacked wards, stepping over piles of dead bodies and shooting anyone left alive at point blank range. RSF leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has pledged to investigate the allegations of war crimes by his soldiers in el-Fasher - but many doubt his sincerity, as he has failed to investigate previous atrocities. Since overtaking el-Fasher– which they had besieged for over 500 days – and chasing out the Sudanese army, videos, satellite imagery, and testimony from those who've managed to flee indicate the RSF has been pursuing a scorched earth policy in the Darfuri city. The RSF has been fighting the national army for control of the resource-rich nation that sits at the vital crossroads between North Africa, the Sahel, and the Red Sea in a bloody civil war since 2023. 'Crisis of apathy' The group emerged from the janjaweed militia that terrorized Darfur in the early 2000s and was accused of genocide. The US has already accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of committing genocide against African ethnic groups in the current conflict. The situation in el-Fasher was dire even before the RSF overran it this week. The year and a half long blockade of some 250,000 civilians has led to starvation and famine. The UN's migration organization says 26,000 people have managed to flee since the takeover. Many of those are arriving seeking help in the town of Tawila, in north Darfur, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders is running the closest health point. Doctors Without Borders used to provide support to the Saudi hospital but stopped operating in el-Fasher in August 2024 saying it had become too dangerous. On Wednesday the NGO said people arriving at Tawila were showing \"extremely alarming levels of malnutrition among women and children, which is indicative of a famine-like situation.\" The organization's International president Dr Mohamed Javid Abdelmoneim noted however, that very few adult men were arriving, and said this raised concerns about ethnically targeted violence. \"This is testament to the horror unfolding in and around the city,\" he said. One mother of six, who had fled el-Fasher but didn't wish to be named to protect her identity, told aid workers from international NGO Save the Children what they had endured. \"We hid the children in trenches, and we ran into abandoned buildings during the attacks. After that, we just ate umbaz (animal feed),\" she said. Another woman described the long trek to safety, during which she was beaten and robbed by a gang. \"We lost family members, we lost neighbors, we lost everyone,\" she recounted. \"We've been walking for the past four days from el-Fasher. A group of motorbike riders met us on the way…They killed people and insulted us a lot.\" The UN Security Council held a meeting on the crisis Thursday.

There is a moment of awe that washes over you when you step into a forest. Century-old trees tower above, sunlight twinkling through them. Birds tweet. Spiders weave their elaborate webs. The smell of pine needles fill the air.  The act of spending time in the forest is what the Japanese call  shinrin-yoku , a term originating in the 1980s that means \"bathing in the forest atmosphere,\" says Qing Li, a researcher on this topic and a professor at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo.  \"This is not exercise or hiking or jogging,\" he writes in his 2018 book  Forest Bathing: How Trees Can Help You Find Health and Happiness . \"It is simply being in nature, connecting with it through our sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch.\"   Not only is \"forest bathing\" a magical way to explore nature, decades of research has shown that it's good for your health. It can  boost your immune system ,  lower blood pressure  and  help with depression . It can also reduce the stress hormones  cortisol and adrenaline  and turn down the dial on your body's  fight-or-flight response . Li and Gary Evans, director of the  Forest Bathing Institute in the U.K. , talk to Life Kit about the science behind forest bathing and how you can reap these health benefits. 1. Find a location where you're surrounded by trees  The ideal place to forest bathe is well, in a forest. But if you live far away from one or don't have the means to get there, any place that has a lot of trees and quiet spaces will do.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Forest Bathing: A Retreat To Nature Can Boost Immunity And Mood \n       \"You can also get beneficial effects from a city park,\" says Li, but they won't be as significant as walking in the deep woods. A 2022 study published in the  International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health  found that walking in a forest park had a  greater impact on cardiovascular function  than doing so in an urban park.  Walking in an urban park still has health benefits. Another study published in 2022 found that it can  significantly improve mood and reduce stress , compared to walking in an urban gray setting.  2. Set aside a good chunk of time  To reap the ultimate rewards of  shinrin-yoku , plan to spend two to six hours in the woods, says Li.  His research showed that forest bathing for about that amount of time helped boost immunity.  One study  found that participants who walked in the forest for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon saw an increase in anti-cancer proteins and immune cells that kill tumors, with the effects lasting for at least seven days after.   If you can't set aside a good part of your day to meander through the forest, you can also do shorter walks. But the health benefits won't be as significant, says Li. \"The longer [the time in the forest], the better. The longer has more effect.\"  A 2019 study published in the  International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health  found that walking just 15 minutes through the woods  can help relieve stress and anxiety .  3. Aim to reduce heart rate Your forest bathing session is a good time to sit or walk or do some gentle yoga or tai chi. It's not the time to squeeze in your hardcore cardio for the week. \"The difference between normal activities and forest bathing is that we're going to move very slowly,\" says Evans. Forest bathing is about calming down your nervous system and reducing your heart rate and blood pressure.   If you exert yourself too much physically, your \"tiredness will reduce the effect of forest bathing,\" says Li. Your body will produce more stress hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, which studies have shown that forest bathing  can help decrease .  4. Breathe in the scents of the forest Many of the benefits of  shinrin-yoku  come when we inhale the chemicals that trees release into the air, called phytoncides, says Li. They can reduce our stress hormones and increase our levels of white-blood cells known as natural killer cells, according to his research. \n       \n      Related Story:  Suffering From Nature Deficit Disorder? Try Forest Bathing \n       In  one study  from 2009, his team ordered special concentrated essential oils made from Japanese cypress trees and then pumped them into the hotel rooms of test subjects using a diffuser. The people staying in those rooms saw about 40 to 50% of the health benefits as those who did a forest bathing session. As a side note, if you can't make it to a forest, Dr. Li says you could get some of the benefits by diffusing tree-based essential oils at home. 5. Bolster your forest bath with meditation When you get to the forest or the park, walk a little bit and then find a spot that speaks to you. That could be a clearing in the woods surrounded by a bunch of tall trees or a spot where a tree has grown into a curved shape that looks suspiciously like a seat. If it feels beautiful and resonant to you, that's what matters.  Now sit down, says Evans, and try this exercise. \"Inhale for a count of one, two and then exhale for double the length of time, so it's one, two, three, four. Then keep that going.\"  \"When the exhale is slower than the inhale, it sends a physiological message to your body that says: 'I'm safe. I can relax. It's OK,' \" he adds.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Stressed? Instead of distracting yourself, try paying closer attention \n       This particular breathing exercise  has been shown  to have benefits on its own outside of the forest environment. The reason to do it in the forest is to allow yourself to relax so you can begin to notice all the sounds, colors and textures that nature has to offer.  You may be surprised by what you discover, says Evans. \"Depending on what's happening in your emotional world, quite often when we look at nature or the forest, it sends something back to us to help us make sense of what's going on in our life.\" This episode of Life Kit was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. Isn't the forest a magical place... (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CALLING) SEGARRA: ...Like, when you really venture into the woods and you see these century-old trees towering over you, sunlight twinkling through them and spiders weaving their elaborate webs? The smell of pine needles is in the air. Birds are tweeting. You hear a mysterious sound that you're not going to pay too much attention to, but you really hope is not a bear. There is a moment of awe that happens when you step into a forest. And I think a lot of us can sense that forest bathing or taking in the forest through your senses makes us feel better and calmer. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: I was surprised to learn that there are decades of scientific evidence backing that up. A lot of the evidence comes from Japan, where the term forest bathing originated in the 1980s. Over many years, researchers have shown in peer-reviewed studies that time in the forest is a kind of medicine. Forest bathing helps your immune system by increasing your levels of anti-cancer proteins and immune cells that kill tumors. It's been shown to lower blood pressure and stabilize blood sugar. It can help with depression. It can lower adrenaline and turn down the dial on your body's fight-or-flight response. GARY EVANS: What we could see in the data was that, as soon as somebody came into proximity of a tree and they were just present and mindful, paying attention and appreciating the tree, that their - basically, their parasympathetic activity, which is the relaxation response in the body, was increased. SEGARRA: I know - all of that from spending time with trees. On this episode of LIFE KIT, we will talk about how to forest bathe, using the research as our guide to what works. And we'll share some exercises to get you started. Feel free to head outside to listen to this one. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: If, like me, you're wondering why forests are so good for our health, there's an evolutionary hypothesis for this. Simply put - for much of human history, we lived in nature. So the thinking is because we evolved in nature... QING LI: We have a biological need to connect with nature. SEGARRA: So we love nature because we learn to love the things that have helped us survive. That's Dr. Qing Li, by the way. He's a professor at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo and the president of the Japanese Society of Forest Medicine. He's designed and carried out a lot of Japan's research on forest bathing. Another expert you'll hear from in this episode is Gary Evans, director of the Forest Bathing Institute in the U.K., which was heavily inspired by Dr. Li's work. Gary says, at this point, we can survive without exposure to nature and forests specifically. EVANS: But there's a difference between surviving and thriving. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right, let's get thriving. We're going to start with some forest bathing basics. Gary says, a lot of the time, when we head to the woods or a hiking trail, nature is a backdrop, you know? It's secondary. EVANS: So we might be walking and talking with a friend, running, cycling, horse riding. SEGARRA: But he says if you want to get all the benefits of forest bathing, your primary focus should be connecting with nature. So takeaway one - really let yourself bathe in the forest. It's kind of like bathing in your tub. You're there to relax and dwell in the experience. EVANS: You say, OK, I'm going to go to the park. I'm going to go to the forest. I'm going to appreciate the natural beauty. So that's the first thing - set the intention. SEGARRA: Ideally, you can also set aside an entire morning or afternoon for this because... EVANS: The important thing for people listening to remember is that relaxation is not, like, an on-off switch. SEGARRA: As for how much time, Dr. Li suggests 2 to 6 hours. LI: The longer is the better. The longer is more effect. SEGARRA: His research shows that the health benefits can last for as long as 30 days, so aim to do this once a month - or maybe more often if your sessions are short. EVANS: So you can build up the dose. SEGARRA: Now let's talk for a minute about location. A nice patch of forest or woods is best. But if you don't have one nearby, you could get some of the same benefits from a city park if it has a lot of trees and quiet spaces. LI: So if you have one day to visit a city park, you also can get a beneficial effect. SEGARRA: But, he says, the effects will be smaller. Lastly, before you enter the forest, do some basic wilderness prep. This is not an exhaustive list, but that can include sunscreen - which you should be wearing every day anyway - also bug spray and long pants to protect you from ticks and plants that will give you a rash. And check the weather ahead of time. Make sure it's safe to venture out. Also, remember to stay on the marked trails and check yourself for ticks after, too, if those are a problem in your area. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right. So we're into the woods. Next up, takeaway two - slow down and disconnect. Your forest bathing session is a good time to sit or to walk or to do some gentle yoga or tai chi. It's not the time to squeeze in your hardcore cardio for the week. EVANS: So the next difference between normal activities and forest bathing is that we're going to move very slowly in forest bathing. We want to reduce the heart rate. SEGARRA: Also, Dr. Li says if you tire yourself out physically... LI: Your tiredness will reduce the effect of forest bathing. SEGARRA: So when you get to the forest or the park, maybe you walk a little bit and then find a spot that speaks to you. Could be a clearing in the woods surrounded by a bunch of tall trees or a spot where a tree has grown into a curved shape that looks suspiciously like a seat. If it feels beautiful and resonant to you, that's what matters. Now sit down. EVANS: And then just be present with the environment and leave the phone alone. SEGARRA: All right. You're settled in. Your phone is turned off, or at least put away. It's time to engage your senses. LI: The sight, hear, taste, smell and touch. SEGARRA: We're going to start with smell and inhalation, because Dr. Li says based on his research, many of the benefits of forest bathing come when we inhale the chemicals that trees release into the air. They're called phytoncides. And when we breathe them in, they, on their own, can do things like reduce our stress hormones and increase our levels of anti-cancer proteins. Dr. Li has done experiments on this. His team ordered these special concentrated essential oils made from Japanese cypress trees and then pumped them into the hotel rooms of test subjects using a diffuser. The people staying in those rooms saw many of the same health benefits as the ones who did a forest bathing session, just to a lesser extent. So as a side note, if you can't make it to a forest, Dr. Li says you could get some of the benefits by diffusing tree-based essential oils at home. But, yeah, takeaway three is to breathe it all in and ask yourself, what do I smell? Behind each smell in the forest is an exquisite, wondrous fact. For instance, the flowers on trees emit a fragrance so they can attract bees with the promise of food that's packed with energy. According to researchers at the University of Tel Aviv, a plant called the evening primrose will actually pump up the concentration of sugar in its nectar when bees are buzzing nearby. I learned that from a book called \"Forest Walking: Discovering The Trees And Woodlands Of North America,\" written by Peter Wohlleben and translated by Jane Billinghurst. I also learned that the earthy smell underfoot in the forest - the one that makes you feel like, hell yeah, I'm in nature - that comes from insects, bacteria and fungi breaking down leaves and rotten wood. And that process will enrich the soil with nutrients. So the advice here? Notice what you smell and maybe later, follow your curiosity to learn more. You can also try some breathing exercises because there's a big mindfulness component to forest bathing. In addition to being a forest bathing researcher, Gary is a yoga and mindfulness teacher, and he says the practice of meditation started outdoors. EVANS: Buddha had his awakening underneath a tree. No coincidence that trees were there right at the start of this. SEGARRA: So here's an exercise to try as you're sitting among the trees. EVANS: So if you inhale for a count of one, two, and then you exhale for double the length of time - so it's one, two, three, four. And so you keep that going, inhaling for two, exhaling for four. When the exhale is slower than the inhale, it sends a physiological message to your body. I'm safe. I can relax. It's OK. SEGARRA: This breathing exercise has been shown to have benefits on its own outside of the forest environment. The reason to do it in the forest is to allow yourself to relax. EVANS: What happens on a physiological level is when our parasympathetic fires up and we slow down, nature comes into sharper focus. So there's a change of perception. SEGARRA: And it gets easier to notice things - sounds, colors, textures. And that's takeaway four - engage your other senses. Listen for the rustling of chipmunks, the gurgling of a creek, the groan of branches in the wind. And notice the colors - bright, red leaves exploding from trees, light green ferns creating a canopy cover for the ground. When you observe nature, that can slow down your fight-or-flight response and lower the levels of stress hormones in your body. You can also take this moment to touch some stuff. No, no, no, not the poison ivy. You know what? Why don't we start with the tree? Go ahead and feel its bark. Is it rough or smooth? Does it have any scars from old branches? Another sense you can use in the forest is taste. I mean, you have to be careful. Don't just pick up a mushroom and start eating it. But if you learn about plants and foraging, you can add that to your forest bathing practice. You can also buy teas and tinctures from trained herbalists in your community and then bring them to the forest with you. Lucretia VanDyke is an herbalist, a ceremonialist and author of the book \"African American Herbalism: A Practical Guide To Healing Plants And Folk Traditions.\" LUCRETIA VANDYKE: I always laugh. I'm like, at this point of my life, I'm so into herbalism that if you can't talk about plants, I don't really know what to talk about anymore. SEGARRA: One of her favorite trees is the mimosa tree. VANDYKE: Well, it has these Dr. Seuss-like pink flowers on it. SEGARRA: Also, herbalists use the flowers to help people work through grief. So sometimes she'll take a couple drops of a mimosa tincture in her mouth. VANDYKE: And then I go sit with the plant, and I hold the flowers, and I'm, like, laying there with the plant and staring at it in awe. It becomes, like, this full-circle thing. SEGARRA: That brings us to takeaway five - go deeper. Work with the forest to process what you're going through. Gary says you can see nature as a mirror. EVANS: So depending on what's happening in your emotional world, quite often, when we look at nature or the forest, it sends something back to us to help us make sense of what's going on in our life. SEGARRA: The Forest Bathing Institute, which he runs, leads group trips to forests in the U.K. and around the world. And people have told him that forest bathing helped them work through grief. EVANS: Actually, a number of them that have come on our sessions have found that it's been very helpful to go into the forest and see the natural cycle of life. Somehow it's enabled them to reconcile what's happened. SEGARRA: In the forest, dead trees provide homes for woodpeckers and owls, and when they fall down, they become hiding spots for frogs and other creatures. And they provide a space for mushrooms and moss to grow. In death, they support life. Another metaphor - think about how trees communicate with each other through their network of roots underground. It's a stark contrast with how isolated many of us feel these days. Lucretia shared this exercise. VANDYKE: So a beautiful practice, I feel like, is imagine how all these roots are touching and watering each other. And if we need to, to, like, imagine, you know, even energetically, like, my family lives in North Carolina and I'm in Louisiana. So energetically, like, you know, when I imagine that tree and touching that tree, I can imagine myself and my spirit being at home with them. SEGARRA: If you want to try something a little more spiritual, while you sit in the forest, ask a tree or a plant to tell you about what medicine it holds. VANDYKE: You know, let me feel, you know, your medicine. Let me understand your medicine, 'cause that's a lot how the original people did it. It's not like they had a book way, way, way back in the day that told them this plant does this, this plant does that. SEGARRA: And then you can always compare what you imagine to a book. When you spend time in nature and around trees, that can also be an opportunity to think about the folks who came before you, whether that's deep in the forest or even in your neighborhood. Lucretia lives in the Treme district of New Orleans, known for being among the oldest African American neighborhoods in the country. VANDYKE: And it has been, you know, cut in half by a highway. And it's also been, you know, very gentrified. SEGARRA: She likes to look at the neighborhood's oak trees draped with Spanish moss and imagine what have they seen? VANDYKE: I try to imagine, like, the old Creole neighborhoods and how, you know, people of color came together and watched each other's children and built what is now revered today as the birthplace of jazz. Like, those trees have heard some of the original jazz greats ever. SEGARRA: She thinks of generations of kids playing and families sprawled out under the trees. VANDYKE: It puts me in old New Orleans and in those old community moments that, you know, don't exist, or they exist in a new way. SEGARRA: I'm sensing a parallel here, right? Trees bring people together. We sit under them in the shade and picnic. We gather around them and harvest their fruit. But they're in community with each other, too. The young and the old propping each other up and sending each other nutrients through their networks of roots. There's just so much wisdom that trees and plants hold for us when we pay attention. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right. Time for a recap. If you want to forest bathe, go to a place that has a lot of trees with the intention of appreciating and focusing on nature. The trees shouldn't just be a backdrop to some other activity. Go slowly. Take it easy. This isn't about doing heavy cardio. It's about slowing down your heart rate and getting to a calm place where you can start to see the wisdom that nature offers. You can also try some simple breathing exercises, slow yoga or tai chi, or do meditation exercises that use the metaphors the forest provides. On that note, Lucretia is going to walk us through one more forest meditation. Settle down next to a tree and take some deep, belly breaths. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANDYKE: I like for people to imagine your legs being like old tree trunk roots that roots you deep in the ground like the tree. So when I take a deep breath, I imagine the energy from - and love from our ancestors or from Mother Nature coming up those large roots into your legs, into your abdomen, belly expanding. And then as you exhale, sometimes I do a practice of shedding the things that no longer serve me, shaking off the day. SEGARRA: And then she exhales and says a prayer of gratitude to Mother Nature.

Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth will be dramatically restricted by the Trump administration under new proposals by the Department of Health and Human Services. NPR has obtained the draft text of a  proposed rule  that would prohibit federal Medicaid reimbursement for medical care provided to transgender patients younger than age 18. It also prohibits reimbursement through the Children's Health Insurance Program or CHIP for patients under age 19. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       An  additional proposed rule  would go even further, blocking all Medicaid and Medicare funding for any services at hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care. The rules are being prepared for public release in early November, according to an employee at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The employee asked that NPR not use their name because they fear professional retribution for speaking to the media without authorization. An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about the planned timing of the proposed rules' release. A near ban in all states Both supporters and opponents of transgender rights agree that, taken together, the forthcoming rules could make access to pediatric gender-affirming care across the country extremely difficult, if not impossible. The care is already banned in  27 states . \"These rules would be a significant escalation in the Trump administration's attack on access to transgender health care,\" says  Katie Keith , director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. \"I think it's really, really important to note that nothing is changing immediately,\" she explains. \"These would be proposals that would go out for public comment, it would take months for the Trump administration to issue a final rule, and then, if past is prologue, we would see litigation over whatever the final rules are.\" Administration goals In his first days in office, President Trump signed an  executive order  declaring that the United States \"will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another.\" In the months since, HHS  released a report  critical of the research that supports access to this care. A federal suicide prevention lifeline specifically for transgender youth  was cancelled , as were  hundreds of millions  of dollars in scientific research funding related to LGBTQ people. Federal health officials warned  state Medicaid directors  to tread carefully, and the Department of Justice  announced subpoenas  of some children's hospitals and  threatened providers  with prosecution. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think these restrictions are very good,\" says Terry Schilling of the forthcoming rules. Schilling is president of the  American Principles Project , a conservative advocacy group. \"It's going to change the entire transgender industry, and it's going to take away a lot of their funding streams.\" He points to  an opinion poll  from the spring, which found 66% of the public opposes Medicaid coverage for this type of care for young people. \"They believe that if you want to get some type of sex-trait modification procedure, you should have to pay for it,\" Schilling says. \"The American people are fully behind this effort.\" Dramatic new expansion of power The proposal to condition a hospital's participation in Medicaid and Medicare on halting gender-affirming care for youth represents an \"unprecedented\" use of the executive branch's power to control what medical care is available in hospitals, says Keith. \"Because Medicare is such a significant portion of many hospitals' revenue,\" she explains, the rule would essentially force hospitals to end their gender care   programs for transgender youth. That would mean all of those programs' patients — whether they have Medicaid or private insurance — would lose access. This is not how the federal government normally uses this type of rule, Keith says. She served in the Biden administration on the Gender Policy Council, and worked on some \" conditions of participation \" regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, she says. \"They're so basic — it's like, you have to have a crash cart [with] enough medicine to help a pregnant woman in crisis.\" Instead of health and safety standards, this proposal would instruct hospitals \"to stop offering a certain type of care completely to a certain patient population,\" she says. Law professor  Katie Eyer  of Rutgers University questions whether such a rule would survive a court challenge. \"But if it were successful, I shudder to think what this administration would do with such a tool in their hands,\" she says. It could open the door for any White House to withhold all federal funding from hospitals over the provision of medical care that it disfavors. \"The writing has been on the wall that this has been coming,\" says  Lindsey Dawson , director of LGBTQ Health Policy at KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization. Yet the timing of the release has been a mystery for months. Notice of both proposed rules — though not the rules themselves — appeared on a government register over the summer, and it's been unclear why they have yet to be released, Dawson says. 'An obsessive focus' The administration's efforts on transgender issues stretch far beyond health policy and beyond youth. The Federal Trade Commission recently  hosted a workshop  \"on unfair or deceptive trade practices in 'gender-affirming care' for minors.\" The military forced out  transgender servicemembers . Universities have been told their federal funding is  contingent  on adopting anti-transgender policies on issues like bathroom access. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Even the impending lapse in funding for food assistance, or SNAP, is linked to Democratic support for \"gender mutilation procedures,\" according to a banner on the  Department of Agriculture website . \"It's endless,\" says Eyer. \"It really has been an obsessive focus that's been deployed across the administration.\" The warning letters and cancelled grants and more have had a significant chilling effect. In the states where the care is still legal,  many clinics and hospitals  have ended their programs for gender-affirming care. If these rules were to take effect, the remaining programs would likely follow suit. \"There are real people behind all this,\" says Eyer, who is also the parent of a transgender child. \"People are really scared and suffering as a result of this onslaught of attacks on the trans community.\" It's still legal, although access is shrinking Gender-affirming care for youth — including puberty blocking medications, hormones, and rarely, surgery — does not actually violate federal law, Eyer notes. And, despite recent  political pressure , no major U.S. medical organization has altered their clinical guidance that supports these treatments as appropriate and safe. Approximately  3% of youth in the U.S.  identify as transgender or nonbinary, although not all of them seek medical treatment related to their identity. Notably, in Utah, a  state-commissioned analysis  of the evidence recently came to the opposite conclusion as the Trump administration's transgender report. University of Utah researchers found that there was ample evidence of benefits and safety for these treatments, and wrote that policy restrictions on this care for youth \"cannot be justified based on the quantity or quality of medical science findings or concerns about potential regret in the future.\" The draft text of the proposed federal rule obtained by NPR does not mention the Utah analysis, nor does it cite the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose guidelines  also support  access to the care. In Eyer's view, the public release of these rules will offer the opportunity for them to be legally challenged. \"It will be subject to  'arbitrary and capricious' review , and a court will presumably take a close look at the factual basis that actually underlies it,\" she says. \"That is actually preferable to what we've had up until now, which is coercion without law.\" Diane Webber edited this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589127","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:06:00-04:00","title":"Casey Means' Confirmation Hearing for Surgeon General Postponed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The confirmation hearing for Dr. Casey Means, President Trump's nominee for Surgeon General, was postponed on October 30, 2025, after she went into labor during her pregnancy.

Dr. Casey Means, who is pregnant, went into labor. The hearing has not yet been rescheduled.   Department of Health and Human Services press secretary, Emily Hilliard issued the following statement: \"Everyone is happy for Dr. Means and her family. This is one of the few times in life when it's easy to ask to move a Senate hearing.\" Who:  Dr. Casey Means Nominated for:  Surgeon General You might know her from:  Casey Means is a wellness influencer, entrepreneur, and author. Last year, she published a bestselling book about diet and metabolic health  Good Energy . She coauthored the book with her older brother, Calley Means, who works for the Trump administration as a special government employee and is a close advisor to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She did not complete her surgical residency and does not have an active medical license, which would be a major departure from past surgeon generals. She runs a company that promotes the use of continuous glucose monitors. She has described America as in \"spiritual crisis,\" questioned the childhood vaccine schedule and the use of birth control and  has called out  what she calls \"corruption\" at the FDA. What does this role do?  Known as the nation's top doctor, the surgeon general leads the more than 6,000 members of the U.S. Public Health Service, which include physicians, nurses, and scientists working at various federal agencies. The surgeon general serves in the Department of Health and Human Services and issues public advisories and reports to convey health information to the public. With the hearing delayed, what does it mean for the U.S. to not have anyone in place as surgeon general?  The surgeon general is a communicator in chief for the nation's health. The person in the role raises awareness of current health issues. For instance, former surgeon general Dr. Vivek Murthy issued a  report on the health effects of loneliness . Secretary Kennedy himself has taken up a lot of that kind of communication work and uses his platform to promote his views on health. What's expected at the hearing: It's been more than five months since Trump announced Casey Means would replace his initial choice, Fox News contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. She was originally set to join the senate hearing remotely, which is unusual. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, which is holding the hearing, did not explain why she would be joining virtually. Her brother, Calley Means, shared in May that she was pregnant. Senators will likely have tough questions for her about her qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. In  financial filings  released ahead of the hearing, Means committed to resigning from her continuous glucose monitor company if confirmed. She also disclosed financial ties to the supplement industry from which she promised to divest. Means is 38 years old and a graduate of Stanford Medical School. She completed most of her residency training to be a head and neck surgeon, but quit before finishing. In the years since, she pivoted to what's known as  functional medicine , a field that focuses on root causes of illness and often encompasses lifestyle change and alternative medicine approaches that are not always evidence-based. She briefly had a functional medical practice in Oregon. But she did not become board certified and her Oregon medical license is currently  listed as inactive . Means grew her public profile on social media and through her book  Good Energy . She did the rounds on big podcasts in the wellness space with her brother and coauthor Calley Means. Her message tends to echo Kennedy's and that of his allies in the Make American Healthy Again movement, especially in flagging the high rates of chronic illnesses in the U.S. \"What we are dealing with here is so much more than a physical health crisis — this is a spiritual crisis,\" she said at a  congressional roundtable  led by Republicans last year. She often talks about the U.S. food supply and environmental toxins and she criticizes the pharmaceutical industry. Kennedy has said she will be the greatest surgeon general ever. Pushback on several fronts: There has been significant opposition against Means's confirmation from medical and public health experts. They point to her lack of leadership or clinical experience, something that surgeon generals traditionally have, and  some of her views . For example, she has raised concerns about the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule and  questioned  hormonal birth control. She has also endorsed raw milk, as has Kennedy, who would be her boss. \"The Senate's likely confirmation of Casey Means as Surgeon General, an individual who never completed medical training, would mark a disastrous precedent for the nation's top public health role,\" Dr. Jerome Adams wrote in a statement to NPR. Adams served as surgeon general in the first Trump administration. \"Numerous qualified candidates — fully trained, licensed physicians who champion prevention and wellness —could lead the 6,000-person [U.S. Public Health Service] with distinction,\" he added. \"Confirming Means reflects a capitulation to political pressures, not a desire to get the best person for the job.\" Earlier this year, opposition to her nomination  also emerged  from some of Kennedy's MAHA supporters, partly out of concern that she wouldn't be critical enough of vaccines or carry forward other priorities of their movement. Still, it seems unlikely that the Senate would have scheduled the hearing if the Trump White House weren't confident that Means could be confirmed. The withdrawal of previous health official nominations from this administration have all happened before a hearing took place. NPR follows the  confirmation hearings  for the Trump administration.

Dr. Casey Means is a wellness influencer, an entrepreneur and author. But as we just learned, the hearing was postponed at the last minute. NPR's Will Stone joins us to tell us why and who Casey Means is. I mentioned a few things, Will, that Casey Means is, but she's got a new title, right? WILL STONE, BYLINE: Yeah. She's soon to be a mother. It turns out Casey Means, who is pregnant, just went into labor. The hearing was already scheduled to be virtual, so she did not have to travel so late in her pregnancy. She's currently in Hawaii, and the committee was set to do this, but clearly, this changed the plans. And at this point, we don't know when the hearing will be rescheduled. MARTÍNEZ: All right. So tell us more exactly about who she is. STONE: Yeah. Casey Means is in her late 30s. She went to Stanford Medical School and was pretty far along in her training to be a head and neck surgeon, but she dropped out of residency before finishing. And then she pivoted to what's known as functional medicine, briefly had a practice in Oregon, but really made her name on social media and through a book she published on diet and metabolic health. I'll note that her brother is a close adviser to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. So Casey Means and her brother did the rounds on big podcasts in the wellness space. And her message tends to echo what you hear from Kennedy and his allies in the Make America Healthy Again Movement, especially when they talk about high rates of chronic illness. Here's how she talked about that at a congressional roundtable led by Republicans last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CASEY MEANS: What we are dealing with here is so much more than a physical health crisis. This is a spiritual crisis. STONE: And she often talks about our food supply, environmental toxins. She criticizes the reliance on the pharmaceutical industry, and Kennedy has said she will be the greatest surgeon general ever. MARTÍNEZ: All right. Yeah. But there's been some pushback, though. STONE: Yeah, there has on several fronts. Certainly, a lot of opposition from folks in the medical and public health establishment who argue she doesn't have the qualifications. She doesn't have the leadership or clinical experience you'd expect from the surgeon general, who's considered the nation's top doctor. Dr. Jerome Adams, who was surgeon general during Trump's first term, told me confirming Means would set a, quote, \"disastrous precedent.\" And she has made statements casting doubt on the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule, also about oral contraceptives. She's endorsed raw milk, similar to Kennedy. Now, interestingly, when Trump announced he'd picked Means, you also saw some opposition emerge among some supporters of Kennedy, and part of that was some in that camp seemed to worry she wasn't critical enough of vaccines. So there were questions about whether this fracture in the MAHA base would sink her confirmation, but it's unlikely the administration would have set up this hearing if she didn't have the votes to get confirmed. MARTÍNEZ: Well, Trump announced that she was his pick back in the spring, and now the confirmation is delayed. So what does it mean for the country not to have an acting surgeon general? STONE: Yeah. I mean, we've been months and months without a surgeon general under this administration. And some of that delay was because Trump had first picked a Fox News contributor for the role. She dropped out. Then they went to Casey Means. As for the job itself, you know, surgeon general is not about making big policy decisions. The person is really a communicator-in-chief for the nation's health. They take up causes. They issue reports. You can remember Biden's surgeon general did a lot on loneliness and social media. So that's not happening, obviously, since she's not confirmed. But I will point out Secretary Kennedy himself has certainly taken up a lot of the communication work, as we've seen, and he uses his platform to promote his views on health. MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Will Stone. Will, thanks. STONE: Thank you.

The strikes, the deadliest since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, marked the  most serious challenge to the tenuous truce  to date. The bombardment pointed to Israel’s readiness to strike hard at what it says are Hamas violations of the ceasefire deal. Meanwhile the militant group denies it is responsible and blames Israel for violations.  \n     \n         \n                \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n\n    \n \n\n                 \n                \n                 \n                     The death toll in Gaza from overnight Israeli strikes has climbed to 81, hospital officials said Wednesday. Previously, at least 60 people, including many children, were reported killed in what is likely the most serious challenge to the tenuous ceasefire deal in Gaza since it came into force earlier this month. \n                 \n                \n            \n         \n     \n After it announced the restoration of the ceasefire, the Israeli military said it carried out another airstrike in northern Gaza, targeting what it called a site where weapons were being stored for an imminent attack. Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said it received two bodies from the strike. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The latest violence puts new strains on American pressure to keep the ceasefire on track.

Hamas  denied any involvement in the deadly shooting and, in turn, accused Israel of “a blatant violation of the ceasefire deal.” It also said it would delay handing over the body of another hostage to Israel because of the strikes. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Deadly strikes across Gaza The strikes across Gaza in the early hours Wednesday pounded buildings and tent camps housing displaced families.

It said they included militants involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war, including Nukhba company commander Hatem Maher Mousa Qudra, who led the attack on the Ein Hashlosha Kibbutz, the statement said.  The military said it would continue to “respond firmly and act decisively to eliminate any threat to the State of Israel.” Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said Hamas was responsible for the consequences of its ceasefire violation and attributed the high death toll to the militant group using civilians as human shields.  Throughout the war, Israel has often hit targets it says are Hamas figures while in their homes or shelters where their families are also located alongside other families. How the strikes were triggered An Israeli military official said Wednesday that the soldier in Rafah, identified as Master Sgt. Yona Efraim Feldbaum, 37, was killed by “enemy fire” that targeted his vehicle on Tuesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential military operations, said Israeli troops in the area came under attack numerous times on Tuesday as they worked to destroy tunnels and Hamas infrastructure. The Israeli military has leveled almost the entire city of Rafah over the past months, demolishing nearly every building, according to satellite photos. Hamas insisted it was not involved in the Rafah gunfire, reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire and called on mediators to pressure Israel to stop. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump defends Israel Marmorstein, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Washington was informed about the strikes and that they were carried out in full coordination with the United States. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump , on a trip to Asia, defended the strikes, saying Israel was justified in carrying them out after Hamas killed the Israeli soldier, who also held U.S. citizenship.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Members of Israeli defense forces carry the coffin of the reservist Master Sergeant Yona Efraim Feldbaum, who was killed in the Gaza Strip, during his funeral at Mount Herzl military cemetery, in Jersualem, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

But he said he’s still confident the ceasefire would withstand the escalation in violence because “Hamas is a very small part of the overall Middle East peace. And they have to behave.” If not, they will be “terminated,” Trump added. Trading accusations Netanyahu accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by handing over body parts this week that Israel said were partial remains of a hostage recovered earlier in the war. Israeli officials also accused Hamas of staging the discovery of some of the remains Monday, sharing a 14-minute, edited video from a military drone. Hamas replied in kind on Wednesday, saying the Israeli strikes reveal “a clear Israeli intention to undermine the ceasefire agreement and impose new realities by force.” The group also said in a statement that the U.S. is offering Netanyahu a “political cover” to carry on with its aggression in Gaza. The prime minister of Qatar, which mediated the ceasefire deal along with the U.S. and Egypt, said there was a violation of the ceasefire agreement “by the Palestinian party,” but it was unclear if Hamas was affiliated with the gunmen responsible. The fighting was “very disappointed and frustrating for us,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “We’ve been engaging in a very intensive way with both parties in order to ensure that the ceasefire holds.”  The ceasefire deal requires Hamas to return all the remains of hostages in Gaza as soon as possible. Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the bodies of the hostages  amid the vast destruction in Gaza , while Israel has accused the militant group of purposely delaying their return.  There are still 13 bodies of hostages in Gaza and their slow return is complicating efforts to proceed to the ceasefire’s next phases, which address even thornier issues, including the disarmament of Hamas, deployment of an international security force in Gaza and deciding who will govern the territory. Funeral prayers at Gaza hospitals In Gaza, Palestinians were reeling after the strikes. At dawn, Palestinians at a displaced camp cleared remains of a destroyed tent next to a crater. They found the body of a small child and wrapped it in a blanket. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Palestinians injured in an Israeli army strike are brought to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

Yehya Eid, who said he lost his brother and nephews, wept over a small body in a bloodied white shroud outside the hospital. He said the strike came without warning. “These are children who were killed. What did they do wrong? Did they fight in the war?” Eid asked.  Israel’s two-year campaign in Gaza  has killed more than 68,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95401","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"15:02:00-04:00","title":"The helpers need help: Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown drags on, nearly 42 million Americans are at risk of losing SNAP benefits on November 1, creating a 'cliff' of food insecurity. Food banks across the country, including the Llano Food Pantry and Central Texas Food Bank, are experiencing a dramatic rise in clients — from 15–20 to over 100 per week — showing a surge in need. Experts stress that SNAP provides critical food support equivalent to $44 million in monthly benefits for low-income households, far exceeding what food banks can offer.

Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms. \n         By Barbara Sprunt \n        \n           Wednesday, October 29, 2025 • 3:02 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Chris Jones and Mary Ann Edwards have been volunteering at the Llano Food Pantry in central Texas for several years. It's a tight-knit group, where food recipients gather early to chat outside, and community members contribute their own produce. \"The ladies all come in and go, 'guess what I did with those plums I got last time?' We share recipes, we talk and it's like a big family,\" Edwards said. Four years ago, the pantry was receiving 15-20 people each week. Now, they say, the number is about a hundred clients every week. \"Right now — and we've been doing this for a while — we limit canned goods,\" said Jones. \"We didn't have to do that in the beginning because we didn't have that many people coming through.\" They said the past year has been tough for families, with rising food costs. \"I think the telltale is that every time we're opening, we are getting new clients — maybe one, maybe two, maybe three,\" said Edwards. \"Just a steady increase. They come in, they're embarrassed — 'I never thought I would be in this position.' You know, a lot of people are in the same position you're in, and that's why we're here.\" Their clientele is mainly young families, people with disabilities and the elderly. They said they don't see a lot of people who also receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. \"That's not saying that when that goes away, we're not going to get a bunch of new people coming in,\" mused Edwards. SNAP is a mandatory entitlement program that provides food aid to about 1 in 8 U.S. residents. It is the  country's largest nutrition assistance program . Congressionally-approved appropriations provide the roughly $8 billion a month needed to fund the program. With the U.S. Senate repeatedly failing to get enough votes to fund the government and end the shutdown,  nearly 42 million people are in danger of losing those benefits  come Nov. 1. Jones said they'll have to take it one week at a time. \"If we need to, we'll do a fundraiser,\" she said. 'Catastrophic need for food' The Llano pantry is part of the Central Texas Food Bank, which has been ramping up distributions in the midst of the government shutdown, including for active duty military personnel and civilian federal employees like TSA agents. \"We've been saying that although the government has shut down, the Central Texas Food Bank is open and that means we will do everything we can to step up and meet the demand for increased need of our services,\" said CEO Sari Vatske. But Vatske cautioned that food banks alone cannot make up for what would be lost for residents if SNAP were to disappear. \"The average household that we see receives about $350 per month, which roughly translates to about $44 million worth of SNAP benefits that will be gone from families,\" she told NPR. \"There is no way that we alone can make up for a $44 million food budget shortfall.\" She said shutdowns aren't like other food crises. \"When you see natural disasters, they tend to be isolated, whether it's an ice storm or a flood. But the thing with the government shutdown is that it's manmade and we are all experiencing it,\" Vatske said. \"So in a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need. So we implore the government to reopen and we are asking the community to step up now more than ever.\" Vatske said seeing the increasing demand and knowing benefits might be taken away adds to the toll food bank volunteers and staffers face. \"The thing that motivates food bankers is knowing that we are a beacon of light in an otherwise dark place,\" she said. \"We're really at a point that the helpers need help.\" Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, began working at the food bank during the Great Recession. \"The absolute worst part of working at a food bank is when you gotta tell people, 'that's all we got today. We're out.' And you know you can't send them anywhere because they're going to be out, too,\" he said. \"Now, don't get me wrong, it's far worse for the people waiting in that line. But, I worry about my co-workers.\" If SNAP benefits are gone for November, Riggs said it will be a \"public health crisis.\" He compared it to the recession 17 years ago and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end,\" he told NPR. \"Those two previous national crises, when that happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food.\" New Mexico has about 21 percent of its population participate in SNAP, the highest rate in the country,  according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's statistics from earlier this year. \"It's very difficult. It's not like we were holding back before,\" Riggs said. \"Then this crisis comes in and it's very daunting. SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network. There's no business in the country, no corporation that could grow nine times its size or capacity in one year, let alone by Nov. 1.\" With the impasse on Capitol Hill growing seemingly deeper the longer the shutdown continues,  individual states are investigating what they can offer  to help bridge the food assistance gap. Political fallout Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, has introduced a  bill that would provide appropriations for the Department of Agriculture  to provide SNAP benefits during any lapse because of the shutdown. That bill currently has ten GOP co-sponsors and one Democratic co-sponsor, Peter Welch of Vermont. There's no commitment from leadership to bring it up for a vote, yet. Even if the government acts before Nov. 1, it will likely take at least a few days to get SNAP benefits distributed to states, and then onto debit-like cards that recipients use to purchase food. In the meantime, more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general and three Democratic governors are  suing the Trump administration  over the suspension of food benefits. As the shutdown drags on, both parties seem convinced they will receive less of the public blame. But Rich Thau, president of Engagious, a firm specializing in public policy message testing, said what he's hearing from the public is \"a pox on both your houses.\" As part of his  swing voter project , Thau talks monthly with voters in key swing states who swung from former President Joe Biden to President Trump. In a recent focus group in Pennsylvania, Thau said nine of the 13 participants blamed both parties equally for the shutdown. \"When I turn the news on, I hear, 'the Republicans are blaming the Democrats. The Democrats are blaming the Republicans,'\" said Brenda S., 60, a participant from Philadelphia, PA whose last name was not provided in the focus group setting, as is common practice for these surveys. \"It's both of their faults. They don't care about us.\" The SNAP cliff represents one of the biggest impacts of the shutdown, which has been marked by the White House attempting to  stave off some of the traditional shutdown pain points , like  paychecks for servicemembers . If SNAP benefits are delayed for the month of November, Thau said he does not know   which party is more able to build a compelling narrative about why lawmakers couldn't reach a deal and fund the government. \"Who's going to sound more persuasive to someone when it comes to who's to blame for this?\" he told NPR. \"If you're a member of Congress, you don't want your constituents starving because you can't reopen the government. But by the same token, if you think that this is a winnable fight and you're in no rush to reopen the government because somehow you think your side is winning — and if both sides feel that way — the inertia will continue.\" He added: \"I imagine each side has some strategy that causes them to think the other side is going to blink first. But they're playing with fire.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590293","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Keeps Flirting with the Idea of a Third Term.

term. That would be unconstitutional \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Flying on Air Force One somewhere between Japan and South Korea, President Trump, after repeatedly teasing it, appeared to finally acknowledge a third term isn't in the cards. \"I have my highest poll numbers that I've ever had,\" Trump said wistfully. \"And you know, based on what I read, I guess I'm not allowed to run. So we'll see what happens.\" Trump's job approval rating,  as tracked by Gallup , is not in fact at a high point — though at 41% he isn't at his lowest point, either. Saying \"we'll see what happens,\" is a standard Trump line that leaves his options open. Though, in this case, legal experts say there is no way around the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. It states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There are many parts of the constitution that are unclear,\" said Rick Hassen, who specializes in election law at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"But the 22nd Amendment is quite clear: no more than two terms. And it was passed because there was a president who served more than two terms and the country thought that that was not good.\" While Trump has previously floated the prospect of a third term, the issue came up again most recently when Steve Bannon, an on-again off-again Trump ally and MAGA mastermind, been talking about a third Trump term as a certainty. How Bannon stirred the pot \"Well, he's going to get a third term,\" Bannon said in  a recent interview with The Economist . \"Trump is going to be president in '28 and people just ought to get accommodated with that.\" Asked about the Constitution, Bannon said, \"There's many different alternatives.\" In an April interview  with  Morning Edition  host Steve Inskeep , Bannon gave slightly more detail. \"We're working on some things that are well inside the Constitution … and I think people will agree there will be very smart work arounds,\" Bannon said, before adding that talk of a third Trump term is \"exploding liberals heads, exploding progressive's heads that Trump's going to be with them forever.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It would be easy to chalk this up as wishful thinking or even just trolling from a professional provocateur trying to ingratiate himself to Trump. But the president himself has kept it going, too. Monday on Air Force One, when asked about Bannon's assertions about a third term, Trump said he would \"love to do it\" and again said it is \"very terrible\" to have such good numbers. Asked if that meant he was \"not ruling it out,\" Trump said, \"You have to tell me.\" Though he also suggested that Republicans have a strong bench of potential 2028 candidates and said a ticket featuring Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be unbeatable. He did bat down one of the possible loopholes floating around — that he could run for vice president and then return to office after the elected president steps aside. \"I think the people wouldn't like that,\" Trump said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" But, just like Bannon, Trump leaves the option of somehow staying in office dangling out there. What Congress has to say about that Just outside the Oval Office, red campaign-style \"Trump 2028\" hats sit on a bookcase of merchandise the president shows off to visitors. \n       \n       Twitter \n       Last month, when Democratic leaders visited the White House to talk about averting a government shutdown,  the hats appeared on the resolute desk mid-meeting .  \"It was the strangest thing ever,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN afterward. \"I just looked at the hat, looked at JD Vance, who was seated to my left and said, 'Don't you got a problem with this?' And he said 'no comment' and that was the end of it.\" That is, until the White House tweeted out photos of the meeting with the hats looming large. As Trump talked repeatedly about a third term this week, members of Congress were asked to weigh in, too. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he didn't see a path to a third Trump term because amending the Constitution takes a long time. \"I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about the constrictions of the Constitution,\" said Johnson. \"As much as so many of the American people lament that. The Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that's ever been produced, and he has a good time with that, trolling the Democrats whose hair is on fire at that very prospect.\" In an  interview with NPR's  Here and Now  on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also said Trump was simply trolling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Brendan Nyhan, a government professor at Dartmouth College, says it doesn't really matter if at this moment the president is serious or not. \"We are probably going to hear about it for the next three years, because he enjoys it,\" said Nyhan. \"It gets the kind of reaction he wants and it serves his political purpose.\" Trump is both making liberal's heads explode — as Bannon put it — and trying to delay becoming a lame duck president, whose power wanes as the campaign to replace him heats up. Nyhan said the fact that anyone is talking about it is a symptom of what he calls an \"authoritarian malaise\" in the country. \"It's profoundly destabilizing to call into question something as blatant as the 22nd Amendment, which explicitly rules out what Trump is 'joking' about,\" said Nyhan, who leads Bright Line Watch, which monitors the status of American democracy. \"We've seen again and again him joking about things that he means to encourage or at least seems to give tacit approval to.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In his second term, Trump has massively expanded his executive power, as Republicans in Congress largely either cheer or shrug. \"Is it possible that he could try to suspend elections, suspend the Constitution, run for a third term,\" said Rick Hassen, who leads UCLA's Safeguarding Democracy Project. \"All of these things are possible, but that means we are no longer the American democracy that we've had, and then the country's in real trouble. But if you're asking about a legal path to a third term, it's just not there.\" Plus, he asked slyly, would Trump really want to run for a third term against former President Barack Obama? ( Trump says he would .) NPR's  Saige Miller  contributed to this report. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   President Trump keeps flirting with the idea of serving a third term in office. Here he is last night on Air Force One. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Based on what I read, I guess I'm not allowed to run. So we'll see what happens. MARTIN: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution clearly states, no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice. So why is Trump talking about it again? NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith digs in. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: This week's outbreak of Trump 2028 mania began when Trump ally and MAGA mastermind Steve Bannon sat down for an interview with The Economist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE BANNON: Well, he's going to get a third term. So Trump '28. Trump is going to be president in '28, and people just ought to get accommodated with that. KEITH: Asked about the 22nd Amendment, he said there are many different alternatives, but he didn't detail them. Bannon said nearly the same thing back in April in an interview with MORNING EDITION host Steve Inskeep. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) BANNON: We're working on some things that are well withinside the Constitution, and it'll be very - I think people will agree that'll be... STEVE INSKEEP: Give me an example. BANNON: ...Very smart workarounds. INSKEEP: Give me an example of one thing. BANNON: I don't want to whet your appetite. Let's get through... INSKEEP: (Laughter). BANNON: ...Let's get through the hundred days. INSKEEP: You've already whetted my appetite. BANNON: Let's get through - no, because it's exploding liberals' heads, progressive heads that Trump's going to be with them forever. KEITH: Now, it would be easy to chalk this up as Bannon stirring the pot, but President Trump himself has kept it going. Here he was on Air Force One, Monday morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever. It's very terrible. I have my best numbers. If you read it... UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: You're not ruling out a third term? TRUMP: ...If you read it - am I not ruling it out? You'll have to tell me. All I can tell you is... KEITH: He did bat down the idea of running for vice president and then assuming the presidency. But just like Bannon, Trump leaves the possibility of a third term dangling out there. Here he was back in March, again, on Air Force One. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I'm just telling you, I've had more people say, please run again. I said, we have a long way to go before we even think about that. KEITH: I followed up, asking, are you planning to leave office on January 20, 2029, or are you saying you might not? He looked directly at me and then looked over my head. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Go ahead. Any other questions? KEITH: The president stocks red Trump 2028 hats on a bookcase of merch just outside the Oval Office. Last month, when Democratic leaders visited to talk about averting the government shutdown, the hats showed up on the president's desk, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HAKEEM JEFFRIES: It was the strangest thing ever. And I just looked at the hat, looked at JD Vance, who was seated to my left, and said, don't you got a problem with this? And he said, no comment. KEITH: Yesterday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he didn't see a path to a third Trump term. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE JOHNSON: I think the president knows - and he and I have talked about the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that - the Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that's ever been produced, and he has a good time with that. KEITH: So is it all just a troll? Brendan Nyhan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College. BRENDAN NYHAN: We're probably going to hear about this for the next three years because he enjoys it. It gets the kind of reaction he wants, and it serves his political purpose. KEITH: Trump is both making liberals' heads explode, as Bannon put it, and trying to delay becoming a lame duck president - less relevant than those competing to replace him. Again, Nyhan. NYHAN: It's profoundly destabilizing to call into question something as blatant as the 22nd Amendment, which explicitly rules out what Trump is, quote, \"joking\" about. And we've seen again and again him joking about things that he means to encourage or at least, you know, seem to give tacit approval to. KEITH: In his second term, Trump has massively expanded his executive power as Republicans in Congress either cheer or shrug. But Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA, says, there's no nuance in the 22nd Amendment. RICK HASEN: Is it possible that he could try to suspend elections, suspend the Constitution, run for a third term? All of these things are possible, but that means we're no longer the American democracy that we've had, and then the country's in real trouble.

lowest-ever cap on refugee admissions to U.S. \n         By Ximena Bustillo \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 2:49 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is drastically cutting the number of  refugees  it will admit to the U.S., capping it at 7,500 for the current fiscal year. That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980. The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification  in the Federal Register  filed on Thursday, and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S.  since March . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have  shuttered their services , changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process. Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare. Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state,  previously told reporters  that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility.\" The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025. Push for higher caps Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S. \"It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,\" said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced  sharp budget , resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office. Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for  critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance  the Afrikaners are poised to receive. The pause also sent the refugee resettlement agencies into turmoil as refugees already cleared to arrive in the U.S. received notice their flights had been cancelled. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Among those left in limbo were  Afghans who worked with the U.S. military , a move that some Republicans have criticized. A lower-court judge had ordered the government to  at least resume the refugee program  for those who had already been approved to travel, but  an appeals court  ruled in favor of the administration. The notice in the Federal Register makes no mention of Afghans, despite past promises to help those who supported the U.S. in America's longest war. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/chinese-surveillance-silicon-valley-trump-administration-congress-21c5f961b1fd22f9a9e563ebe64e5582","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:15Z","title":"Cultivating Community: How Local Traditions Shape Sustainable Cities","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article explores how integrating local traditions and community participation into city planning can lead to more sustainable and resilient urban environments.

Trump said after Thursday’s meeting with Xi that China would follow up with Nvidia on the sales of chips but did not announce any resolution.  Trump also has announced  that the U.S. government has taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Longtime Chinese activist Zhou Fengsuo said the U.S. government is letting American companies set the agenda and ignoring how they help Beijing surveil and censor its own people.

They are fighting a powerful opponent. An AP analysis of lobbying filings showed U.S. tech and telecom companies, as well as their trade associations, spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two decades on lobbyists who listed key bills impacting China-related trade on their quarterly disclosure reports, among other issues. \n    \n     Have a news tip?

And  Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute , a government-backed research institute working on sensitive technologies such as encryption, sought access to $280,000 worth of Azure OpenAI cloud services from Microsoft. Even sanctioned Chinese companies can use AWS and Microsoft Azure to offer surveillance abilities to customers overseas. For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China’s two largest surveillance companies,  use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad , according to  marketing material on the company websites . Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure,  according to a post on Hikvision’s website this year .  Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft’s policies and doesn’t support China’s access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole. Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn’t include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed. The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce  asked for comment  on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015,  it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products , but most fell through. In 2024,  it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems  and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success. Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies. “I think we’ve been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.”  “What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what’s behind the fact we haven’t made as much progress.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A rickshaw driver transports wounded people, with the help of bystanders, to a nearby hospital in Beijing, on Sunday, June 4, 1989, after PLA soldiers fired rounds towards crowds gathered outside Tiananmen Square.

They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons. But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police.  For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints. In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance.  Smith drew parallels with IBM’s sale of computing gear  to Nazi Germany, which  has been well documented by historians . IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.”  Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith’s proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations. Smith’s bill went nowhere. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Rep.

Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee  Gold Key Matching service. In 2004,  the Commercial Service invited American companies  selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms  in the “safety and security” market , followed by another publication later describing  market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems . Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in  policing trade shows , even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party.  Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a  webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools  to China’s public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows.  Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns. “I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?’” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry. Despite promises to nail shut Washington’s revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing’s surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London.

Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment.  That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China’s central government  “to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems”  on its website.  A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n      \n      \n  \n     \n        Documents reviewed by the AP show how the U.S. government helped promote opportunities in the Chinese security market to American companies. (AP video Marshall Ritzel)\n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016. “The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it’s cameras, it’s software, it’s facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone’s face, you blow up international trade.” Wolf’s colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n\n\n     \n        .headline {\n            font-family: \"AP\";\n            font-size: 28px;\n            color: #333;\n            text-decoration: none;\n            text-align: center;\n            display: block;\n            background-color: #ffffff;\n            padding: 5px;\n        }\n        \n        .headline:hover {\n            color: #0066cc;\n        }\n        \n        .image-link img {\n            width: auto;\n        }\n     \n\n\n\n Photo Gallery: Life Under Surveillance \n\n \n\n \n     \n \n\n \n\n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry.  In 2021, Joe Biden put out  an executive order  describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden’s administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf’s draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China. But once again, Washington lobbyists, lawyers and politicians pushed back. “The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns,” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year. The proposed rule, in the end, stalled out.

After she was released in 2019, she still found herself living in what she calls “an open-air prison,” with every move monitored, until she finally left Xinjiang later that year. She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability. “It’s truly disappointing that the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences,” Haitiwaji said.  —- Burke reported from San Francisco and Washington, Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

The country’s overall fertility rate has plummeted, with Heilongjiang province recording fewer than three births per 1,000 residents. Experts warn that without significant change, China will face a deepening demographic imbalance, with aging populations and shrinking youth numbers threatening economic and social stability.

Here's one family's story \n         By John Ruwitch \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 12:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. YIMIANPO, China — Small town life suits Lin Xin. Her yard in the town of Yimianpo, in northeastern China, is one big, sun-soaked garden where the family grows cabbages, carrots, peanuts, and a cornucopia of other fruits and vegetables. Kittens ambush one another from behind shrubs. \"This place is well-suited to retirees,\" she said. \"Living in the countryside is truly nice, and comfortable.\" The thing is, Lin is not a retiree. At 48, she's not even old. She and her husband moved to Beijing 20 years ago to chase their dreams and try to cash in on China's booming economy. But the plan was cut short; they moved back to Yimianpo a few years ago to take care of their aging and ailing parents. Meanwhile, Lin's only daughter is in college in the capital, with no plans to return — and ambivalent   about having kids herself. Lin Xin's story highlights the fast-unfolding demographic shifts happening in China, where the population is shrinking and aging. The United Nations  has projected  that between 2024 and 2054, the country could see a decline of over 200 million people. Economists say China is getting old before it gets rich, posing a massive challenge for the country's leadership. \"There are just no young people here\" Yimianpo was once a thriving rail outpost along a train line built by the Russian Empire starting in the late 1800s. Later, heavy industry, owned by the state, anchored this part of China. But state-enterprise reform — in which China shut down weak state-run companies and allowed market forces to play a larger role in the economy — took a toll. The town now feels sleepy, surrounded by corn and rice fields. Small workshops where Russian stacking dolls are made are sprinkled throughout town. Lin says the best work that she and her husband could find was driving two of the town's six taxicabs. \"Earnings here are generally low compared to big cities, where there are more opportunities, passenger traffic and people,\" she said. Official statistics show the population in Yimianpo contracted by about a third between 2010 and 2020 — from roughly 34,000 people to just over 23,000. In the same period, the number of children 14 or under dropped by half, while the number of people aged 65 and up increased by over 70%. That's partly because of an exodus of people — like Lin — hunting greener pastures as market reforms boosted the country's east and south, and killed off local state-owned enterprises. The departure of working-age people, in turn, fueled a sharp decline in the birthrate. On a recent one-day visit to Yimianpo, NPR saw almost no children. One elementary school has been repurposed as a storage yard; Lin says another has been turned into a parking lot. A movie theater is abandoned. \"It's not that people here won't have babies,\" said Lin. \"There are just no young people here.\" In 2023, official data for Heilongjiang, the province where Yimianpo is located, recorded fewer than three births per 1,000 residents — China's lowest rate. But the problem is not confined to the rustbelt. China's national population has shrunk now for three straight years, dropping by some 4.3 million, according to official statistics. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Lin has two siblings, but only one child of her own, even though she was legally allowed to have two due to a loophole in China's now-dismantled \"One Child\" policy that allowed rural-based families with firstborn girls to have another child.  But her decision had nothing to do with policy. In Beijing, she was hustling from the get go, first helping a sister who had a mobile phone stall in an underground mall, and later running a shop of her own. \"I had thought about having a second child, but back then I didn't have the time—I was too busy,\" Lin said. Then her parents got ill, exposing the other end of China's demographic crunch: a huge bulge in the number of people 65 and up.  Some experts  expect the population in that age bracket to double between 2020 and 2025 to around 366 million. China's lack of a robust social safety net made the decision for her. \"I had no choice but to come back, because the family couldn't manage without someone here,\" Lin said. China's young people are delaying childbirth and prioritizing their own well-being Lin Xin's daughter Lu Lin, 20, is a third-year student at the Beijing Contemporary Music Academy, studying musical theater. She says school is not a huge challenge at the moment. So she does some modeling, plays cards — even qualifying as a referee for a popular card game — and has recently been dabbling in finance. She trades futures and gold online; a friend showed her how. Asked if she wants kids someday, the answer is a qualified: maybe. \"If I were to answer now, I would prioritize personal freedom,\" she said. For it to work, she says she would want to wait until she's around 30 years old and have at least 5 million yuan — about $700,000 — in the bank. For context, that's a lot in China. It would take decades for most people here to sock that much away. For now, her focus is on herself. \"I've never even seen the world; how can I tell my children how to live or teach them in the future?\" she said. For years, the Chinese government has been trying  various tactics  to try to boost the birthrate, including cash handouts of 3,600 yuan ($507) for each child until the child turns three. Some local governments may pay more or provide housing subsidies. Starting this fall, China is also  waiving tuition fees  for children in their last year of kindergarten. Lu Lin says government subsidies might help tip the balance for her at some point — if the money's good enough. But that decision is a long way off. She reflects a quiet revolution in people's attitudes in China, with young people delaying marriage and childbirth while prioritizing their own well-being. In Heilongjiang Province, the average age for marriage in 2020  hit 31.48 , according to data published in 2023. The nationwide average was 23.59 in 1980 and 28.67 in 2020. Traditions like  si shi tong tang , or multiple generations under one roof, are being rewritten. In Yimianpo, Lu Lin's family has lived on the same plot for five generations. Lu said she likes it there just fine, but she does not see herself ever returning to live there. \"The development of Yimianpo is a bit too slow. I can't really have the kind of life I want there,\" she said. Her mother seems fine with that decision. But it does raise a key question. \"When we chat now — those of us born in the '70s — the topic often comes up: what will we do when we're older?\" Lin said. \"There's only one child in the family, and we don't expect them to support us in old age.\" The solution she's come up with, for now, is that she and her friends and siblings will all live nearby and take care of one another. \"The idea,\" she said, \"is to stick together and retire as a group.\" Jasmine Ling contributed research to this story from   Yimianpo and Beijing. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cempasuchil-mexico-marigol-day-of-dead-climate-997b90e2e827ad543992ec8507837b6e","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Biden Administration Launches New Immigration Services Amid Human Rights Concerns at U.S.-Mexico Border","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Biden administration has announced new immigration services at the U.S.-Mexico border to improve access to legal pathways for asylum seekers.

This year alone, cempasuchil producers said they lost up to half their flower crop from heavy rains and flooding. “This year, we lost a lot. We struggled to even grow the cempasuchil.

The flowers are also a crucial economic engine across Mexico, which commerce groups predict will rake in nearly 2.7 million dollars for farmers in 2025. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ortiz and her family began growing the flower 30 years ago in their small plot of land in Xochimilco, a rural borough in the south of Mexico City where residents have continued to carry on ancient farming techniques using canals that wind through farmlands like a maze.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Catrina sculptures stand in a field of cempasuchil flowers in San Luis Tlaxialtemalco on the outskirts of Mexico City, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025.

But they say that they’ve been dealt a heavy blow for consecutive years as heavy rains, drought, floods and other climate shifts have made it increasingly difficult to keep their crops alive. This year, torrential rains stretching on for months wiped out more than 37,000 acres of crops across the country, according to government figures. In a visit to cempasuchil fields earlier this month in Xochimilco, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said that as many of 2 million marigold plants were put at risk. Despite that, she said that production this year simultaneously broke a record of 6 million plants as farmers ramp up to meet increasing demand even as growing the flower has become more precarious. Ortiz said the excess of rain has brought on pests, diseases and rotted the roots of her plants. She estimates she lost at least 30% of her crop, while others say they’ve lost closer to 50%.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The family has been forced to drop money on insecticides, fertilizer and more to save their crops. As they have, razor thin profit margins have turned into losses, and they’ve had to cut back on basics like beef and sweets to make ends meet. “If I were to take a hard look at all our losses, I’d be incredibly disillusioned and even not want to grow them anymore,” she said. “We’re just trying to push forward and make sure this keeps going on.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Adapting to climate change Just down the road from Ortiz’s farm, government scientists are searching for long-term solutions beyond the short-term economic relief provided by the local government. In a small seed bank known as Toxinachcal, men in white suits meticulously pick through sprouts in a lab dish.  The scientists have been at work for a year and a half saving up thousands of seed variants of native plant species, including 20 variants of cempasuchil, in jars lining giant freezers in the hopes that the storage facility will be a key tool in fighting the most adverse effects of climate change. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank, said part of the reason that the crop has been devastated is because farmers in recent years have elected to use a hybrid marigold seed variant from the United States.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank known as Toxinachcal, stands inside the refrigerated room where native seeds are kept, in the Xochimilco borough of Mexico City, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.

But that means farmers have turned away from sturdier, native breeds, which have longer stocks and widely vary in color, size and texture. The genetic diversity of these Mexican breeds makes them more resilient to drastic climate shifts like the ones seen this year, Soto said.  “These native seeds have adapted to different geographies, in high altitudes and low, in places where there’s a lot of rain or there’s none at all, or where they need to be resistant to insects,” she said.  “The (hybrid) seeds have been bred for another purpose. It doesn’t have the genetic diversity needed to take on climate change.” If more climate events, like the floods that roiled producers wipe out an entire crop, Soto said the bank will make seeds available to local producers to recover their crops – this time with a more resilient variant that their ancestors have been farming for centuries. Carrying on an ancient tradition Meanwhile, growers are scrambling to bounce back in the short term, saying the losses also represent a threat to the farming tradition their families have struggled to maintain on the edge of the dense city of 23 million people. Carlos Jiménez, 61, has long worked the fields of Xochimilco, but began to grow the shorter marigold plants eight years ago when he noticed the hybrid was more marketable. As he’s lost more crops and gotten lower prices for the plants because of the mildew gathering at their roots, he said he’s begun considering ways to adapt, like building greenhouses. “The plants get sick, they rot, and our business is snuffed out,” Jiménez said. “And with it goes our tradition because it’s our economy.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Flor Jimenez waters her crop of cempasuchil flowers in preparation for Day of the Dead celebrations in Xochimilco where marigolds are grown on the outskirts of Mexico City, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025.

Turns out it's a new tyrannosaur \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:04 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's known as the \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" fossil: A triceratops and a tyrannosaur, skeletons entangled, locked in apparent combat right up until the moment of their mutual demise. Even in the Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana, a spot known for great finds, this specimen was, in a word, \"fantabulous,\" says  Clayton Phipps , a self-described rancher, cowboy and dinosaur hunter. That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about  Tyrannosaurus rex , the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal  Nature , paleontologists  Lindsay Zanno  and  James Napoli  conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage  T. rex , but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species —  Nanotyrannus lancensis . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The majority of paleontologists, after some debate, had dismissed the idea that any other tyrannosaurs existed besides  T. rex . And yet, the sands of Montana seem to have disgorged a second one. In a broader analysis of other fossils, the two researchers also uncovered what they say is a third tyrannosaur species, formerly presumed to be a juvenile  T. rex . \"We knew the specimen was exceptional,\" says Zanno. \"We did not realize it would turn decades of research about  T. rex  on its head.\" \"Just insanely good\"   The Montana dig began on a breezy summer day when Phipps' friend, Mark Eatman, found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon. Phipps thought maybe there was half a dinosaur hidden below. But after two weeks of digging, Phipps and his older cousin revealed that those bones belonged to a stunning triceratops. \"It was crazier than any site I've ever done before or since because every bone is in place,\" he says. \"The skeleton was just all together — just insanely good.\" Then, while excavating the light yellow sand from around the specimen, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate. It was a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. \"I'm like, 'What?' I start brushing and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg,\" he recalls. \"Oh man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet. I was like, 'No way — there's another dinosaur in here.'\" This was a bipedal,  carnivorous  dinosaur, entwined with the triceratops. \"Just laying like they died,\" says Phipps. The scientific consensus pegged this second dinosaur as a teenage  Tyrannosaurus rex  — a conclusion that would soon be overturned. Teenage angst A few years ago, the nonprofit  Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences  acquired the fossils and rock they were encased in (some 30,000 pounds) from Phipps and donated them to the museum. \"They were a Christmas present waiting to be unwrapped,\" he says. Zanno, who is head of paleontology at the museum, was thrilled. \"It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen,\" she says. She and the museum built  an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs  to house a live-action research experience. \"It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo-lab without a barrier and talk to the scientific team that's working on the fossils,\" says Zanno. When that work began, Zanno also figured the carnivorous dinosaur was the world's most complete juvenile  T. rex  ever found. \"But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags,\" she says. For context, paleontologists had previously debated whether small-bodied tyrannosaurs were teenage  T. rexes  or a different species altogether. The existence of a two-legged tyrannosaur species that lived alongside  T. rex  was proposed back in the 1940s, but had long since fallen out of favor. The consensus converged on juvenile  T. rex , \"meaning it would have been the only major predator in end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid impact,\" says Zanno. Most researchers believed that  T. rex  — which could be  12 feet high , 40 feet long and weigh around 15,000 pounds — had outcompeted all other meat-eating dinosaurs. The completeness of the new skeleton provided Zanno with the ideal specimen to test these long-standing conclusions. \"This is such a controversial topic,\" she says. \"And we don't want to write another paper that just stirs the pot. We want to write the paper that ends the debate.\" The dueling dinosaurs settle a duel One of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than  T. rex 's puny appendages. \"We never had a complete arm of this animal,\" says Zanno. \"These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture.\" Contrast that with  T. rex , \"an animal that's a mouth on legs.\" There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than  T. rex . Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported  T. rex es against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. \"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all,\" she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. \"That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown  Tyrannosaurus rex ,\" says Zanno. All of the results point to one conclusion, according to Zanno and Napoli. This was no teen  T. rex . This was a fully grown  Nanotyrannus lancensis  — the same species first identified in the 1940s and later largely dismissed by the paleontological community. It was \"a small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a  T. rex ,\" explains Zanno. In addition, while making models of all those other alleged  T. rex  skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling  Nanotyrannus lethaeus . \"The name comes from Greco-Roman mythology for the [Lethe] River where souls used to drink and forget their prior lives and be reincarnated,\" she says. \"That's a reference to this animal having been under our nose and not recognized for what it was.\" For years, most researchers believed there was just one tyrannosaur —  rex . But now the king has been de-throned. There were at least two other tyrannosaurs holding court. \"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing,\" says Zanno. \"They had an abundance of different predators. And refutes this idea that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid struck.\" Loving being wrong Thomas Holtz , a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the research, welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity proposed by the new study. \"I always said with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it,\" he says. \"And now I can because there's sufficient evidence. I think they've made a very strong case.\" Though, he adds, \"We'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent,\" referring to the study of how organisms are classified (and, sometimes, re-classified). Holtz argues that one consequence of the study is that paleontologists no longer know what a juvenile  T. rex  looked like — because previously assumed \"teenagers\" were likely  Nanotyrannus . That's an arena of future research and discovery, along with fleshing out the varied biologies and behaviors of this growing group of tyrannosaurs. Zanno agrees that there remains much to understand. She believes there's likely to be additional dinosaur species that have been hidden in plain sight in museums and collections across the world. \"This is why I love science,\" says Zanno. \"I have the only job in the world where my job is to second-guess myself every day and everything I think I know.\" \"When it comes to shedding doubt on research on Earth's most famous dinosaur,\" she says, referring to  T. rex , \"that's an intimidating endeavor. But this is how we grow as a profession and how we grow as scientists.\" Zanno believes this study will pave the way for paleontologists to look for more complex patterns in this and other prehistoric ecosystems. \"From here forward,\" Zanno adds, \"what I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-where-to-donate-cuba-haiti-red-cross-67f2e4b033d5339fcbe0ec98a719c192","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"01:06:14+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa Devastates Caribbean; Humanitarian Response and Donor Guidance","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, made landfall in Jamaica and caused severe damage across the northern Caribbean, including Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

hurricane  in history. The deadly storm has also caused devastation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  The world is still learning the extent of the destruction, but relief organizations are already mobilizing to help across the northern Caribbean.  As is typical in disasters, nonprofit groups told The Associated Press that cash is the best way to help, since unsolicited goods donations can overwhelm already strained systems. Experts recommend using sites like Charity Navigator or the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance to check out unfamiliar charities before donating. Here is some of the work being done and ways to support people impacted by Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and beyond.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Locals supporting locals: United Way of Jamaica The 40-year-old nonprofit has a history of supporting Jamaicans after disasters, especially the country’s farmers.

submarine, President Donald Trump said on social media Thursday after  meeting with the country’s president . President Lee Jae Myung stressed to Trump  in their Wednesday meeting  that the goal was to modernize the alliance with the U.S., noting plans to increase military spending to reduce the financial burden on America.  The South Korean leader said there might have been a misunderstanding when they last spoke in August about nuclear-powered submarines, saying that his government was looking for nuclear fuel rather than weapons.  Lee said that South Korea’s current diesel-powered submarines have limits in tracking other countries’ submarine activities.

But nuclear-powered submarines have superior endurance and can stay submerged for a significantly longer period. Trump said in a separate post that the country would build its nuclear-powered submarine in the Philly Shipyard, which was bought last year by South Korea’s Hanwha Group. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 ‘America First’ Trump loved hanging out with the global elite during his Asia trip \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Democrats test a new playbook in Tuesday’s election: Less talk of Trump, more focus on economy \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 American farmers welcome China’s promise to buy their soybean but this deal doesn’t solve everything \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n It was unclear what the size or cost of the sub project would be, but South Korea had said as part of talks with Trump that it had committed $150 billion to invest in  America’s shipbuilding capacity . \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n   \n      Stay up to date with the latest news from AP.\n   \n   \n     Follow on \n     \n   \n \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n U.S. nuclear submarine technology is widely regarded as some of the most sensitive and highly guarded technology the military possesses.

neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro that left at least 119 people dead drew protests for excessive force Wednesday and calls for the Rio’s governor to resign. Dozens of favelas residents gathered in front of the state’s government headquarters shouting “assassins!” and waving Brazilian flags stained with red paint, a day after Rio’s deadliest raid and hours after families and residents laid dozens of dead bodies on a street in one of the targeted communities to show the magnitude of the operation. Questions quickly arose about the death count and the state of the bodies, with reports of disfigurement and knife wounds. Brazil’s Supreme Court, prosecutors and lawmakers asked Rio state Gov.

She said her son was killed in a prior operation in Penha. “Do we have a death sentence? Stop killing us,” said activist Rute Sales, 56. Many residents came Penha in Rio’s poor, northern zone to the imposing Guanabara Palace on motorbikes. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Death toll from Rio de Janeiro police raid on drug gang rises to 121 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Anguish in Rio: Photos show bodies lining the streets after massive police raid \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Huge Brazilian raid on Rio gang leaves at least 64 people dead and 81 under arrest \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The toll of 115 suspects and four policemen killed was an increase over what authorities originally said were 60 suspects dead in Tuesday’s raid by about 2,500 police and soldiers in the favelas of Penha and Complexo de Alemao.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Felipe Curi, Rio state police secretary, told a news conference that bodies of additional suspects were found in a wooded area where he said they had worn camouflage while battling with security forces. He said local residents had removed clothing and equipment from the bodies, in what would be investigated as evidence tampering.  “These individuals were in the woods, equipped with camouflage clothing, vests and weapons. Now many of them appeared wearing underwear or shorts, with no equipment, as if they had come through a portal and changed clothes,” Curi said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Earlier Wednesday, in the neighborhood of Penha, residents had surrounded many of the bodies — collected in trucks and displayed in a main square — and shouted “massacre” and “justice” before forensic authorities arrived to retrieve the remains. “They can take them to jail, why kill them like this? Lots of them were alive and calling for help,” resident Elisangela Silva Santos, 50, said during the gathering in Penha. “Yes they’re traffickers, but they’re human.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The tally of suspects arrested stood at 113 — up from 81 cited previously, Curi said.

They drew gunfire and other retaliation from gang members, sparking scenes of chaos across the city on Tuesday. Schools in the affected areas shuttered, a local university canceled classes, and roads were blocked with buses used as barricades.  Many shops remained closed Wednesday morning in Penha, where local activist Raull Santiago said he was part of a team that found about 15 bodies before dawn. “We saw executed people: shot in the back, shots to the head, stab wounds, people tied up. This level of brutality, the hatred that is spread - there’s no other way to describe it except as a massacre,” Santiago said. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Castro to provide information about the police operation and scheduled a hearing with the state governor and the heads of the military and civil police next Monday in Rio. The Senate’s commission for human rights said it was asking for clarifications from the Rio state government. Meanwhile, Rio prosecutors requested that Castro provide detailed information about the operation and proof that there was no less harmful means of achieving its objectives.  And the federal public prosecutor’s office asked the Forensic Medical Institute to ensure that autopsy reports contain full descriptions and photographic and radiographic documentation of all injuries. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Castro said on Tuesday that Rio was at war against “narco-terrorism,” a term that echoed the Trump administration  in its campaign against drug smuggling  in Latin America.  On Wednesday, Castro called the operation a “success,” apart from the deaths of the four police officers.  Rio’s state government said that the suspects who had been killed had resisted police. Rio has been the scene of lethal police raids for decades. In March 2005, some 29 people were killed in Rio’s Baixada Fluminense region, while in May 2021, 28 were killed in the Jacarezinho favela. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Residents surround the bodies of people killed the day before during a police raid targeting the Comando Vermelho gang in the Complexo da Penha favela of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.

Human Rights Spokesperson Marta Hurtado said.  But Brazil must “break this cycle of extreme brutality and ensure that law enforcement operations comply with international standards regarding the use of force,” she said, adding that the body was calling for full-fledged policing reform. Late on Wednesday, President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  said on X that he had instructed the justice minister and director-general of Federal Police to meet Castro for a meeting in Rio.  Brazil cannot accept that organized crime “continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence across cities,” he said. The operation’s stated objectives were capturing leaders and limiting the territorial expansion of the Red Command gang, which has increased its control over favelas in recent years. Gang members allegedly targeted police with at least one drone. Rio de Janeiro’s state government shared a video on X of what appeared to show a drone firing a projectile from the sky. Gov. Castro, from the conservative opposition Liberal Party, said Tuesday that Rio was “alone in this war.” He said the federal government should be providing more support to combat crime — in a swipe at the administration of Lula’s leftist administration.

Criminal gangs have expanded their presence across Brazil in recent years,  including in the Amazon rainforest .  Roberto Uchôa, from the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety think-tank, said that criminal gangs have strengthened despite these kinds of operations, suggesting that they are inefficient. “Killing more than 100 people like this won’t help decrease the Red Command’s expansion.

2025-10-30T11:02:58+00:00\n\n“That man, that young man — I forgive him.” Erika Kirk softly spoke those words about the gunman accused of assassinating her husband,  conservative activist Charlie Kirk , as she struggled to hold back tears last month during his memorial service. Her public declaration inspired another. Hollywood actor Tim Allen said he was so moved by her words that he was forgiving the drunken driver who caused his father’s death 60 years ago. Barely two weeks after Charlie Kirk’s death, members of a Michigan congregation made public that  they too were forgiving a gunman , the one who had just attacked their church, killing four people and injuring eight others. Their high-profile acts of forgiveness are all the more remarkable given the politically charged and highly polarizing climate gripping the U.S. It has pushed people of faith to contemplate what forgiveness means, particularly in the face of violence, trauma and unspeakable grief, and whether it could shift public consciousness toward compassion. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While some see a glimmer of hope in this moment, others are skeptical. Miroslav Volf, professor of theology at Yale Divinity School, said he views President Donald Trump’s response to  Erika Kirk’s words  — that he hates his opponents — as the more typical sentiment. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            More coverage\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Utah campus where Charlie Kirk was shot provided less security than other venues as he toured nation \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A timeline of Charlie Kirk’s assassination and the arrest of a suspect \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Charlie Kirk’s AI resurrection ushers in a new era of digital grief \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n     \n \n\n “Erika Kirk’s gesture is the outlier,” he said. “It was an extraordinary act of courage.

Thomas Berg, visiting professor at the McGrath Institute for Church Life at the University of Notre Dame, said he hopes Erika Kirk’s gesture “ignites some kind of meaningful national conversation about forgiveness.” He said forgiveness is not a one-time event, but a process that takes time and work. Berg, who counsels victims of sex abuse in the Catholic Church, warns that it should never be coerced but authentically given — an act that he says has the power to heal the deepest wounds.  He would like to see more public expressions of forgiveness, which could serve as a balm for the country. “I hope this is not a passing moment,” he said. “The dynamic of forgiveness throws a wrench into the dysfunction of our partisan divides and our inability to have a reasonable exchange of ideas.” Dave Butler, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and science fiction writer based in Utah, believes forgiveness is a mandate for all Christians, as his church teaches. He started  a crowdfunding initiative  for the family of the Michigan shooter who opened fire on the Latter-day Saints congregation, which as of this week, had raised a little over $388,000. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Butler said he started it because — in addition to the grieving church members who had lost loved ones in this mass shooting — there was the family of the gunman that was also traumatized. “They also did not choose this,” he said. “Nevertheless, they are now short a husband and a father. If we’re not really thoughtful, we might be inclined to see them more as antagonists rather than victims. More than 10,000 people have contributed and they understand what they’re doing is an act of forgiveness.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Forgiveness from the perspective of Anabaptists An often-cited modern example of forgiveness is the  response of the Amish community  around Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, after a gunman killed five Amish schoolgirls and wounded five more in 2006 before taking his own life. Local Amish immediately expressed forgiveness for the killer and supported his widow. Amish are part of the wider Anabaptist movement, which puts heavy emphasis on Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, containing some of his most radical and counter-cultural sayings — to love enemies, live simply, bless persecutors, turn the other cheek and to endure sufferings joyfully. In it, Jesus says God will only forgive those who forgive others. While many outside the Anabaptists’ world have endorsed their beliefs about forgiveness — which they also  voiced for Haitian kidnappers  of Anabaptist missionaries in 2021 — others say the picture is more complex. Advocates for victims of sexual abuse in Anabaptist communities say victims and their families are often  forced to reconcile  with abusers after the latter make a confession and undergo a brief period of discipline. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A complicated journey for trauma survivors The Jewish perspective on forgiveness is different in that it requires the perpetrator to seek forgiveness from the person who has been wronged, said Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. He heads Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people from three congregations were killed after a gunman attacked it during Shabbat services on Oct. 27, 2018.  “For me, it’s complicated because there are 11 dead people who cannot be sought for forgiveness,” Myers said, adding that he cannot offer forgiveness because the perpetrator — who faces execution — did not show remorse.  “While the perpetrator has received a measure of justice as outlined by the judicial process, it didn’t give me closure because those 11 people are gone,” Myers said. “There is nothing that makes that pain go away.” What gives him some comfort is being able to help other congregations that are going through similar trauma. Myers said he was grateful to have received that support from the Rev. Eric Manning, pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a historically Black church where a self-proclaimed white supremacist  shot and killed nine congregants  on June 17, 2015 — including the church’s pastor at the time. “Today, as someone who belongs to that club no one should belong to, I view it as my sacred obligation to help,” Myers said. “Even if I can help one person, that’s gratifying, that feels healing.” Peg Durachko, whose husband Dr. Richard Gottfried, a dentist, was one of the victims in the synagogue shooting, said that as a Catholic, she looked to Pope John Paul II for inspiration as she read about how he visited the imprisoned man who shot him and offered forgiveness. “I recognize (the gunman) as a child of God who made bad choices to lead him in that direction,” she said. “I’m not his judge, God is. I want him to have eternal life. I don’t harbor hate or ill wishes to anyone, including him. I don’t want to carry this baggage of hate.” ___ AP journalist Peter Smith in Pittsburgh contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s  collaboration  with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

origins of a  mysterious dinosaur  excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young  T. rex  or another type of dinosaur?  At first, researchers had only a  tyrannosaur skull  to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn’t settle the controversy.  Now a research team said there’s new evidence that resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton — first uncovered in 2006 in Montana — that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.  The discovery “rewrites decades of research on Earth’s most famous predator,” said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Growth rings within the bones found in Montana’s Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully-fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature’s skull and an adult T. rex’s — changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses — were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The International Space Station marks 25 years of nonstop human presence in orbit \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 How tiny drones inspired by bats could save lives in dark and stormy conditions \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Storm reveals artifacts preserved in Quinhagak permafrost \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Signs pointed to a dinosaur that’s a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n There’s now “more support and evidence than there ever has been” that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she’s not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new. Other independent scientists also said the debate isn’t over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n There are similarities between the shape of T. rex’s skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps. “I don’t think this study settles everything,” he said.  Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago — or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed. The new skeleton is dubbed “Dueling Dinosaurs” because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti\n\nHurricane Melissa  has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers.

In it, Trump noted other countries testing weapons and wrote: “I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”  The president’s post raised immediate questions. America’s nuclear arsenal is maintained by the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous agency within it — not the Defense Department. The Energy Department has overseen testing of nuclear weapons since its creation in 1977. Two other agencies before it — not the Defense Department — conducted tests. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Trump also claimed the U.S. “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country.” Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads, according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the U.S. has 5,225. Those figures include so-called “retired” warheads waiting to be dismantled. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute further breaks the warhead total down, with the U.S. having 1,770 deployed warheads with 1,930 in reserve. Russia has 1,718 deployed warheads and 2,591 in reserve.  The two countries account for nearly 90% of the world’s atomic warheads.  U.S. last carried out a nuclear test in 1992 From the time America conducted its “Trinity” nuclear bomb detonation in 1945 to 1992, the U.S. detonated 1,030 atomic bombs in tests — the most of any country. Those figures do not include the two nuclear weapons America used against Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.  The first American tests were atmospheric, but they were then moved underground to limit nuclear fallout. Scientists have come to refer to such tests as “shots.” The last such “shot,” called Divider as part of Operation Julin, took place Sept. 23, 1992, at the Nevada National Security Sites, a sprawling compound some 105 kilometers (65 miles) from Las Vegas.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n America halted its tests for a couple of reasons. The first was the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. The U.S. also signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in 1996. There have been tests since the treaty, however — by India, North Korea and Pakistan, the world’s newest nuclear powers. The United Kingdom and France also have nuclear weapons, while  Israel long has been suspected of possessing atomic bombs .  But broadly speaking, the U.S. also had decades of data from tests, allowing it to use computer modeling and other techniques to determine whether a weapon would successfully detonate. Every president since Barack Obama has backed plans to modernize America’s nuclear arsenal, whose maintenance and upgrading will cost nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. relies on the so-called “nuclear triad” — ground-based silos, aircraft-carried bombs and nuclear-tipped missiles in submarines at sea — to deter others from launching their weapons against America.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Restarting testing raises additional questions If the U.S. restarted nuclear weapons testing, it isn’t immediately clear what the goal would be. Nonproliferation experts have warned any scientific objective likely would be eclipsed by the backlash to a test — and possibly be a starting gun for other major nuclear powers to begin their own widespread testing.  “Restarting the U.S. nuclear testing program could be one of the most consequential policy actions the Trump administration undertakes — a U.S. test could set off an uncontrolled chain of events, with other countries possibly responding with their own nuclear tests, destabilizing global security, and accelerating a new arms race,” experts warned in a February article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The goal of conducting a fast-tracked nuclear test can only be political, not scientific. ... It would give Russia, China and other nuclear powers free rein to restart their own nuclear testing programs, essentially without political and economic fallout.” Any future U.S. test likely would take place in Nevada at the testing sites, but a lot of work likely would need to go into the sites to prepare them given it’s been over 30 years since the last test. A series of slides made for a presentation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2018 laid out the challenges, noting that in the 1960s the city of Mercury, Nevada — at the testing grounds — had been the second-largest city in Nevada.  On average, 20,000 people had been on site to organize and prepare for the tests. That capacity has waned in the decades since.  “One effects shot would require from two to four years to plan and execute,” the presentation reads. “These were massive undertakings.” ___ This story has been corrected to fix transposed numbers for the United States and Russia’s nuclear missile reserves.  ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from  the Carnegie Corporation of New York  and  Outrider Foundation .

weapons for the first time in three decades, saying it would be on an “equal basis” with Russia and China. The Kremlin pointed out that a global ban on nuclear tests has remained in place, but warned that if any country resumes nuclear testing Russia would follow suit.  There was no indication the U.S. would start detonating warheads, but Trump offered few details about what seemed to be a significant shift in U.S. policy. He made the announcement on social media minutes  before he met with Chinese leader  Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea to discuss trade. He offered little clarity when he spoke to reporters later aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington. The U.S. military already regularly tests its missiles that are capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, but it has not detonated the weapons since 1992. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which the U.S. signed but did not ratify, has been observed since its adoption by all countries possessing nuclear weapons, North Korea being the only exception. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump suggested, however, that changes were necessary because other countries were testing weapons.

The White House did not immediately respond to questions seeking more details.  When Trump spoke to reporters later, he appeared to be conflating the testing of missiles that deliver a nuclear warhead with the testing of the warheads. Other countries, he said, “seem to all be nuclear testing” but when it comes to the U.S., “We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don’t do testing.” “I see them testing and I say, well, if they’re going to test, I guess we have to test,” Trump said as he continued speaking to reporters. Trump was asked where the tests would occur and he said, “It’ll be announced. We have test sites.” Pentagon officials didn’t immediately respond to questions about the announcement from Trump on the nuclear missile tests. Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat who co-chairs the congressional Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group, said the U.S. “must not resume” nuclear tests.  “This is a reckless decision that will only make us less safe and lead to a new nuclear arms race,” Markey said in a post on X.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday assailed Trump’s announcement, saying in a statement that “current nuclear risks are already alarmingly high.”  “We must never forget the disastrous legacy of over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests carried out over the last 80 years,” Guterres said, according to his deputy spokesperson, Farhan Haqq. “Nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Russia tests of new nuclear-powered weapons  Putin this week announced that Russia  tested a new atomic-powered  and nuclear-capable underwater drone and a new  nuclear-powered cruise missile.  Putin did not announce any tests of Russia’s nuclear weapons, however, which last occurred in 1990. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, emphasized that Russia’s recent tests of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater drone had nothing to do with the global ban on testing nuclear warheads. “Regarding the tests of the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, we hope that President Trump was correctly informed about it,” Peskov said. “There is no way it can be interpreted as nuclear testing.” Trump did not specifically mention the Russian tests in his post, but alluded to the nuclear stockpiles controlled by both Xi and Putin, saying, “Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Putin in 2023 signed a bill  revoking Russia’s ratification of a global nuclear test ban , which Moscow said was needed to put Russia on par with the U.S. The global test ban was signed by President Bill Clinton but never ratified by the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump  signaled he wanted to push his Russian and Chinese counterparts in the other direction,  saying he wanted to resume nuclear arms control talks with both countries.  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson called on the U.S. to refrain from carrying out nuclear tests. “China hopes the U.S. will earnestly fulfill its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and honor its commitment to suspend nuclear testing,” Guo Jiakun said at a briefing in Beijing. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Despite his announcement that sounded like an escalation, Trump told reporters that he would like to see a “denuclearization” and “de-escalation.” “We are actually talking to Russia about that,” Trump said, though he did not elaborate.  Arms control advocates worried Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, quickly criticized the president’s announcement and said Trump was “misinformed and out of touch.” Kimball, in social media posts, said the U.S. has no reason to resume nuclear explosive testing and it would take at least 36 months to resume testing at the former test site in Nevada, where the last detonations occurred underground. “By foolishly announcing his intention (to) resume nuclear testing, Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all U.S. allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by U.S. adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,” Kimball said in a post on X. Japanese survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end World War II condemned Trump’s announcement. “The act vehemently opposes all countries that are endeavoring to achieve a nuclear-free and peaceful world and absolutely cannot be tolerated,” said Jiro Hamasumi, secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo, a survivors organization that won  the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize . ___ Price reported from Washington.

did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025, targeting over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14 to prevent cervical cancer, which kills eight women daily.

national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine before starting cancer immunotherapy is associated with significantly longer survival in patients with advanced lung cancer and metastatic melanoma.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes have been detected in Iceland for the first time in decades, following record-breaking heat and glacial melting linked to climate change.

Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587926","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"If SNAP food aid is cut off, small grocery stores also will feel the pain","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the potential consequences of a SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefit cut, focusing on its impact on small grocery stores like Save A Lot in Springfield, Massachusetts.

  If SNAP food aid is cut off, small grocery stores also will feel the pain \n         By Tovia Smith \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:00 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SPRINGFIELD, Mass. — Theresa Rios came to the grocery store this week with a shorter shopping list than usual. And she's also paying even more attention than usual to price. Walking past a shelf of items labeled \"Real Bacon Bits\" next to packages of imitation bacon bits, Rios doesn't hesitate. \"This is $2.19 and this is $1.59,\" she says, \"so I'm going to buy this.\" Rios is a regular at the Save A Lot store in Springfield. But since she started hearing that her federal food assistance might soon be cut off, she has been trying to put some of the money she receives aside, just in case. And, she's no longer giving all her business to Save A Lot. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I'm at the point where I am shopping for deals at three different stores,\" she says. \"So I'll come here because this is cheaper than Stop & Shop, but some of the items at Price Rite are cheaper than here, and Walmart is [cheaper for] the cleaning stuff … I just shop around.\" Rios says she's also forgoing some items altogether, as she has switched to new, cheaper meals for herself and her three young grandchildren, who she takes care of full time. Dinner is downgraded to rice and beans, and she is no longer buying the kids' favorite cereal. \"They'll have to settle for what I can give them,\" she says. Rios is hardly the only shopper forced to be more frugal. Some 42 million Americans rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, formerly known as food stamps, and as many of them worry about losing their food aid, some grocery businesses are increasingly concerned as well. There are 250,000 retailers authorized to accept SNAP benefits. Most would be able to absorb whatever loss that might come from a lapse in SNAP, but others, like the Springfield Save A Lot, are more vulnerable. SNAP purchases at this store make up a solid 65% of sales. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Already, manager Jose Pajares says those sales have started to dry up. \"It's scary,\" he says. \"I see less customers every day because they're afraid to spend all the money they have for the whole month.\" As a result, Pajares says he's been ordering less stock for the store, and he's dropping prices to try to boost sales. But he still ends up with meat and produce languishing on the shelf until its expiration date. \"If we don't sell we have to throw it out,\" he says. \"Every day, we throw things away.\" Even in the best of times, grocery profit margins are razor thin — usually just a penny or two on the dollar. And recent challenges around tariffs, for example, have sliced profits even thinner. Anthony Peña, who owns this store, also owns a few others that are less dependent on SNAP business. That means he's able to weather a dip in sales for a bit, he says, but not for long. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"After one, maybe two months, I'll start to think about the nuclear options, as we call it, having to think about closing the store,\" Peña says. \"For small supermarket grocers, challenges like SNAP reductions can have a significant impact on profitability, which unfortunately can put some stores and lots of jobs in jeopardy,\" says Scott Moses, an investment banker with Solomon Partners who wrote the book  A 'Grocery' Christmas Carol   about the rapid and seismic changes in the grocery industry. He says a prolonged SNAP shutdown could mean more pressure on the already shrinking number of small independent supermarkets, which are being squeezed by grocery giants like Walmart. By itself, Walmart has almost as much market share as all the nation's 26,000 small supermarket grocers combined. Now, Moses says, Walmart might well gain even more; if there is a cutoff of SNAP benefits, he says the superstore would likely draw in more new customers. \"A significant amount of customers are going to trade down to what they perceive to be lower-priced operators, and net, net, Walmart will likely come out ahead,\" Moses says. For the less fortunate stores, however, there is growing concern that any closures could have broad and serious repercussions. \"There's a ripple effect that's going to happen here,\" says Jerome Bouyer, vice president of retail operations for Save A Lot. For starters, Save A Lot stores tend to be \"in places that are already 'food deserts' and have food insecurity. That just makes the problem that much worse.\" There is also worry about the impact on local vendors, suppliers and distributors. \"For example, the bread guy or the guy who delivers eggs or milk to the store,\" Peña says. \"Instead of delivering 100 units, now he's going to deliver 25 units — 75 units less. So that's when things get a little bit more complicated.\" And of course, store employees are acutely aware that their jobs are also on the line. Already, there are cashiers just standing around during what is supposed to be the busiest shopping hour of the day. \"I'm worried because if customers aren't coming because they don't get food stamps, our jobs are at risk,\" cashier Stephanie Hernández says in Spanish. She has an 11-year-old and twin 1-year-olds. \"If I don't work,\" she says, \"how will I pay my bills?\" If the worst-case scenario does come to pass, it would be a double blow for Hernandez. She gets SNAP benefits herself. So if payments are allowed to lapse, she could end up losing her food assistance — and her job. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica\n\nPeople in Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41Z","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam, particularly in the historic cities of Hue and Hoi An, triggered severe flooding and landslides, with water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers reaching new historical highs.

Tuesday, Vietnam’s disaster management agency recorded more than 1,000 millimetres (39.4 inches) of rainfall over a 24-hour period ending late on Monday in parts of Hue and Hoi An.\n\nVietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said the volume of rainfall in Hue marked the highest ever for a 24-hour period since the country started its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue remains submerged by more than one metre (3.3ft) of water.\n\nImages showed a wide area of the ancient city, including the palace

of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other

It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

said were of deceased Israeli captives, a day after the fragile Gaza ceasefire was shattered by  a series of deadly Israeli strikes  across the besieged enclave.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that the two bodies had been received by Israeli forces via the Red Cross in Gaza and would be transported into Israel for identification.\n\nUnder the US-brokered accord to halt Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, Hamas released 20 living captives in exchange for Israel releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian political prisoners. Israeli forces have also completed a partial withdrawal from urban centres in Gaza.\n\nBut since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, Israeli attacks have  killed dozens of Palestinians  across the enclave. From Tuesday into Wednesday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed 104 people, including 46 children and 20 women.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Hamas committed to returning the remains of all 28 captives, in exchange for the bodies of Palestinians killed in the war. By Thursday, it had handed over 15 sets of remains, saying it continues to press for proper equipment and support to comb through vast mounds of rubble and debris — where thousands of Palestinians killed in Israeli bombardments are still buried.\n\nIsrael claims Hamas has been too slow to hand over the remaining bodies of Israeli captives still in Gaza.\n\nReporting from az-Zuwayda in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said Hamas is still facing “logistical and operational challenges regarding the retrieval of the bodies, specifically in areas that have been impacted by the Israeli bombardment”.\n\n“Hamas has been calling for the entry of heavy bulldozers and machines in order to facilitate the process of recovering bodies. But on the ground, Israel is still accusing Hamas of deliberately procrastinating the release of the bodies,” Abu Azzoum said.\n\nThe dispute over the recovery and handover of bodies has been one of the difficulties complicating US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war for good.\n\nNumerous major obstacles still lie ahead, including the future administration of Gaza and the demand for Hamas to disarm.\n\nEarlier, witnesses said Israeli planes carried out 10 air strikes in areas east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, and tanks shelled areas east of Gaza City in the north before dawn.\n\nThe Israeli military said it carried out “precise” strikes against “terrorist infrastructure that posed a threat to the troops” in the areas of Gaza where its forces are still present.\n\nMeanwhile, a UN official said more than 24,000 tonnes of UN aid have reached Gaza since the start of a ceasefire, while calling for NGOs to be allowed to assist in its distribution.\n\nWhile aid volumes are significantly up compared with the period before the ceasefire, humanitarians still face funding shortfalls, the UN says, as well as issues coordinating with Israeli authorities, which are continuing to seal vital border crossings.\n\nThe World Food Programme’s Middle East Regional Director Samer Abdel Jaber said in 20 days of scale-up following the ceasefire, they “have collected about 20,000 metric tons of food inside Gaza”.\n\n“The implementation of the 20-point [ceasefire] plan remains to be the central point and the central condition for us to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance in a holistic manner,” Alakbarov said.\n\nHe called on Israel to allow more NGOs to participate in the delivery of aid in Gaza, which Israel has banned.\n\n“The persisting issue of registration of NGOs remains to be a bottleneck issue. We continue to emphasise the essential role of NGOs and national NGOs, which they play in humanitarian operations in Gaza, and we have escalated this now,” he said.\n\nIsrael’s assault has displaced most of Gaza’s more than two million people, many of them several times. The majority haven’t yet returned to their ravaged neighbourhoods, fearing they could soon be displaced once again or killed by Israeli forces.\n\nSources told Al Jazeera that the Israeli army carried out home demolitions east of the Tuffah and Shujayea neighbourhoods in eastern Gaza City on Thursday.\n\nIsrael has been demolishing homes since the start of its renewed ground incursion in the area earlier this month, part of what residents describe as a systematic campaign to clear large swaths of residential blocks.\n\nEntire streets have been levelled, with bulldozers flattening homes and infrastructure as Israeli forces push deeper into Gaza City’s eastern districts."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/lebanons-aoun-says-army-to-confront-israeli-forces-after-deadly-incursion","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:05:49+00:00","title":"Lebanon’s Aoun says army to confront Israeli forces after deadly incursion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has ordered the Lebanese armed forces to confront Israeli incursions into southern Lebanon following a deadly overnight raid in the border town of Blida, where Israeli forces killed municipal worker Ibrahim Salameh.

instructed the armed forces to confront any further Israeli incursion in the country’s south after Israeli forces crossed their shared border and killed a municipal worker during an overnight raid.\n\nThe pivotal announcement was made on Thursday after days of Israeli attacks on Lebanese territory in  near-daily Israeli violations  of a ceasefire that went into effect in November.\n\nThe Lebanese forces, unlike the armed group Hezbollah, have generally stayed on the sidelines of the conflict with Israel. But Aoun, a former commander of the Lebanese army, appears to have finally lost his patience with the Israeli-forced status quo.\n\nAoun ordered the army to “confront any Israeli incursion into liberated southern territory, in defence of Lebanese territory and the safety of citizens”, during a meeting with Brigadier General Rodolphe Haykal, according to a statement from the presidency.\n\nThe order came just hours after Israeli soldiers entered the border town of Blida and stormed the town hall, killing municipal worker Ibrahim Salameh, who had been sleeping there, the state-owned National News Agency (NNA) reported.\n\nمراسلة «الأخبار»: استشهاد موظف بلدية بليدا، إبراهيم سلامة، برصاص قوة إسرائيلية توغلت فجر اليوم لأكثر من ألف متر داخل الأراضي اللبنانية واقتحمت مركز البلدية، حيث كان يبيت في إحدى غرفه. بقيت القوة داخل المبنى نحو ساعتين وأطلقت عدة رشقات نارية أصابت سلامة، وألحقت أضراراً في جدران…  pic.twitter.com/63BsFGxisx\n\n— جريدة الأخبار – Al-Akhbar (@AlakhbarNews)  October 30, 2025\n\nTranslation: Al-Akhbar report: Martyrdom of Blida Municipality employee Ibrahim Salameh by gunfire from an Israeli force that infiltrated more than a thousand metres [0.6 miles] into Lebanese territory at dawn today and stormed the municipality centre, where he was staying overnight in one of its rooms. The force remained inside the building for about two hours and fired several bursts of gunfire that struck Salameh, causing damage to the centre’s walls and contents.\n\nVillage residents quoted by NNA said the raid lasted several hours and Israeli forces withdrew at dawn.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed its forces had operated in Blida overnight, saying they opened fire after identifying “an immediate threat” during an operation to destroy infrastructure held by Hezbollah but did not provide evidence. The incident was under review, it added.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Salameh had been deliberately targeted and, if so, why he would be.\n\nAoun condemned the attack as part of a pattern of Israeli aggression and said it was launched shortly after a meeting of the committee monitoring the cessation of hostilities.\n\nHe urged the committee to go beyond recording violations and to press Israel to abide by the  November 27 ceasefire  and halt its breaches of Lebanese sovereignty.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the incursion as “a blatant attack on the institutions and sovereignty of the Lebanese state”.\n\nLebanon’s army has deployed to the area but did not provide details of the operation. The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said it was seeking more information on the incident.\n\nAoun’s orders for the army to confront Israeli incursions have been welcomed by Hezbollah, which said it urged full support for the army.\n\nHezbollah, created during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and occupation of the south, has been the main regional resistance to Israel in the last few decades, harrying Israel out of Lebanon in 2000, fighting a 2006 war to a deadlock but then suffering huge losses in the hostilities that began in 2023 and the subsequent war that saw its top leaders killed.\n\nThe NNA also reported that Israeli forces carried out air strikes on the areas of Mahmoudiyeh and Jarmak in southern Lebanon. No information was immediately available regarding the casualties or damage inflicted. The Israeli military issued a statement saying it targeted Hezbollah infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, in the capital, Beirut, residents heard the loud buzz of an Israeli Hermes 450 drone, used for surveillance but also capable of carrying multiple deadly payloads.\n\nIsrael’s violations of the airspace above Beirut are common and over the past week have become an almost daily occurrence.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly bombarded Lebanon, violating the November ceasefire that sought to end more than a year of hostilities that escalated into months of full-blown war with Hezbollah. In October alone, Israeli strikes have  killed more than 20 people  in Lebanon, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Health.\n\nAs part of last year’s ceasefire, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon and Hezbollah was to pull back north of the Litani River and dismantle any military infrastructure in the south.\n\nAccording to the agreement, only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers are to be deployed in southern Lebanon, but Israel still occupies five positions in southern Lebanon.\n\nUnder pressure from the United States and fearing an escalation of Israeli strikes, the Lebanese government has moved to begin disarming Hezbollah, which has said  it will not lay down its weapons .\n\nLebanese officials believe Israel’s near-daily strikes aim to prevent any reconstruction in the war-ravaged south.\n\nIsrael’s attacks around the Middle East  haven’t ceased with the recent ceasefire in Gaza, which itself continues to be bombarded by the Israeli military.\n\nLebanon, Syria and the occupied West Bank have all witnessed Israeli strikes in the past week, giving credence to the idea that Israel is trying to keep its neighbours  destabilised and weak,  analysts say."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/are-vaccine-mandates-needed-to-achieve-high-vaccination-rates","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:53:21+00:00","title":"Are vaccine mandates needed to achieve high vaccination rates?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the debate over whether vaccine mandates are necessary to achieve high vaccination rates in the United States, using comparisons with countries like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the UK, and parts of Canada.

But experts say that fact alone does not make it a given that the US would follow the same pattern if it eliminates school vaccination requirements.\n\nFlorida state law currently requires students in public and private schools from daycare through 12th grade to have specific immunisations. Families can opt out for religious or medical reasons. About 11 percent of Florida kindergarteners are not immunised, recent data shows. With Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s backing, Ladapo is pushing to end the state’s school vaccine requirements.\n\nThe countries Ladapo cited – Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the UK and parts of Canada – don’t have broad vaccine requirements, research shows. Their governments recommend such protections, though, and their healthcare systems offer conveniently accessible vaccines, for example.\n\nUNICEF, a United Nations agency which calls itself the “global go-to for data on children”, measures how well countries provide routine childhood immunisations by looking at infant access to the third dose in a DTaP vaccine series that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).\n\nIn 2024, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 94 percent of one-year-olds in the United States had received three doses of the DTaP vaccine. That’s compared with Canada at 92 percent, Denmark at 96 percent, Norway at 97 percent, Sweden at 96 percent and the UK at 92 percent.\n\nUniversal, government-provided healthcare and high trust in government likely influence those countries’ vaccine uptake, experts have said. In the US, many people can’t afford time off work or the cost of a doctor’s visit. There’s also less trust in the government. These factors could prevent the US from having similar participation rates should the government eliminate school vaccine mandates.\n\nMultiple studies have linked vaccine mandates and increased vaccination rates. Although these studies found associations between the two, the research does not prove that mandates alone cause increased vaccination rates. Association is not the same as causation.\n\nOther factors that can affect vaccination rates often accompany mandates, including local efforts to improve vaccination access, increase documentation and combat vaccine hesitancy and refusal.\n\nThe countries Ladapo highlighted are high-income countries with policies that encourage vaccination and make vaccines accessible.\n\nIn Sweden, for example, where all vaccinations are voluntary, the vaccines included in national programmes are offered for free, according to the Public Health Agency of Sweden.\n\nPreventive care is more accessible and routine for everyone in countries such as Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK with universal healthcare systems, said Dr Megan Berman of the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.\n\n“In the US, our healthcare system is more fragmented, and access to care can depend on insurance or cost,” she said.\n\nMore limited healthcare access, decreased institutional trust and anti-vaccine activists’ influence set the US apart from those other countries, experts said.\n\nSome of these other countries’ cultural norms favour the collective welfare of others, which means people are more likely to get vaccinated to support the community, Berman said.\n\nAnders Hviid, an epidemiologist at Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, told The Atlantic that it’s misguided to compare Denmark’s health situation with the US – in part because Danish citizens strongly trust the government to enact policies in the public interest.\n\nBy contrast, as of 2024, fewer than one in three people in the US over age 15 reported having confidence in the national government, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group of advanced, industrialised nations. That’s the lowest percentage of any of the countries Ladapo mentioned.\n\n“The effectiveness of recommendations depends on faith in the government and scientific body that is making the recommendations,” said Dr Richard Rupp, of the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.\n\nExperts said they believe US vaccination rates would fall if states ended school vaccine mandates.\n\nMaintaining high vaccination rates without mandates would require health officials to focus on other policies, interventions and messaging, said Samantha Vanderslott, the leader of the Oxford Vaccine Group’s Vaccines and Society Unit, which researches attitudes and behaviour towards vaccines.\n\nThat could be especially difficult given that the United States’s top health official, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, has a long history of anti-vaccine activism and scepticism about vaccines.\n\nThat makes the US an outlier, Vanderslott said.\n\n“Governments tend to promote/support vaccination as a public health good,” she said. It is unusual for someone with Kennedy’s background to hold a position where he has the power to spread misinformation, encourage vaccine hesitancy and reduce mainstream vaccine research funding and access, Vanderslott said.\n\nMost people decide to follow recommendations based on their beliefs about a vaccine’s benefits and their child’s vulnerability to disease, Rupp said. That means countries that educate the public about vaccines and illnesses will have better success with recommendations, he said.\n\nUltimately, experts said that just because something worked elsewhere doesn’t mean it will work in the United States.\n\nMatt Hitchings, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida’s College of Public Health and Health Professions, said a vaccine policy’s viability could differ from country to country. Vaccination rates are influenced by a host of factors.\n\n“If I said that people in the UK drink more tea than in the US and have lower rates of certain cancers, would that be convincing evidence that drinking tea reduces cancer risk?” Hitchings said.\n\nGoogle Translate was used throughout the research of this story to translate websites and statements into English."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/as-battle-for-ukraines-pokrovsk-heats-up-putin-touts-nuclear-powered-arms","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:40:53Z","title":"As battle for Ukraine’s Pokrovsk heats up, Putin touts nuclear-powered arms","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, intense urban fighting continues in eastern Ukraine's Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, with Russian claims of encircling Ukrainian forces contested by Ukrainian and independent Russian military sources.

are interlocked in desperate battles for control of Ukraine’s eastern towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, which Moscow considers a gateway to the remaining unoccupied areas of the Donetsk region.\n\nOn Sunday, Valery Gerasimov, Russian chief of staff,  told President Vladimir Putin his 2nd and 51st Combined Arms Armies were “advancing along converging axes” and “have completed the encirclement of the enemy” in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad.\n\nHe claimed some 5,500 Ukrainian troops were surrounded, including elite airborne and marine units.\n\nRussian military reporters contradicted these claims, with one named “Military Informant” telling 621,000 Telegram subscribers, “There is simply no encirclement” as the two claws of Gerasimov’s attempted pincer movement were still “several kilometres” apart.\n\nOn Thursday, Oleksandr Syrskii, the Ukrainian commander-in-chief, also denied Gerasimov’s claim.\n\n“The statements of Russian propaganda about the alleged ‘blocking’ of the defence forces of Ukraine in Pokrovsk, as well as in Kupiansk, do not correspond to reality,” Syrskii said.\n\nThe Russian reporter also thought it “extremely unlikely” that thousands of Ukrainian troops were trapped.\n\n“If earlier urban battles were a classic meat grinder ‘head-to-head’ with battles for each house,” he said, now they are “conducted by small groups of infantry with the support of many drones”.\n\nGeolocated footage showed that isolated Russian groups had entered western and central Pokrovsk on October 23, but they did not appear to control areas within the city, rather to stake out positions and await reinforcements.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said the situation around Pokrovsk “remains difficult”, and estimated that some 200 Russian troops had infiltrated the town, but said defending units were conducting sabotage operations that prevented Russian units from gaining a permanent foothold.\n\nThe front around Pokrovsk also remained dynamic.\n\nUkrainian military observer Konstantyn Mashovets reported that Kyiv’s troops were able to ambush Russian rear positions in the village of Sukhetsky, northeast of Pokrovsk, demonstrating the porousness of the front line.\n\n“[Russian] small infantry groups in some places began to collide with Ukrainian corresponding groups quite often and suddenly, even before their deployment or when moving to strengthen and replenish their assault groups directly,” said Mashovets.\n\n“Due to the abundance of drones in the air, which make the movement of any large concentrations of infantry extremely dangerous, the positions of both sides remain mixed,” said Kremlin-aligned Russian military news outlet Rybar. “This leads to the absence of a single front line and prevents the determination of the exact boundaries of the control zones.”\n\nMashovets estimated that the Russian 2nd Combined Arms Army, which he described as the “main impact force”, had received reinforcements of between 6,000 and 10,500 troops from other areas of the front ahead of the latest assault, which began in mid-October.\n\n“Special attention is focused on Pokrovsk and the neighbouring areas. That is where the occupier has concentrated its largest assault forces,” said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a Monday evening address. “It is Pokrovsk that is their main objective.”\n\nZelenskyy has often said his objective is to return the war to Russian soil. Ukraine’s long-range drones and cruise missiles were performing that task during the past week.\n\nUkraine struck the Ryazan oil refinery for the fifth time this year on October 23, setting ablaze a crude oil distillation unit. Russia’s Defence Ministry said 139 Ukrainian drones had been shot down overnight.\n\nLeningrad’s regional governor said “several” Ukrainian drones had been shot down without causing damage or casualties on Saturday.\n\nUkraine struck a fuel and lubricants container in Simferopol on Wednesday, Crimean occupation Governor Sergey Aksyonov said.\n\nRussian officials who have been supportive of US President Donald Trump’s efforts to negotiate a peace directly with Putin changed their tone after Trump cancelled a summit with Putin and imposed sanctions on Russian oil majors Lukoil and Rosneft last week.\n\n“The US is our adversary, and its verbose ‘peacemaker’ is now firmly on the warpath against Russia,” said Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, saying Trump was now “completely aligned with mad Europe”.\n\nOver cakes and tea with Russian war veterans on Monday, Putin announced the successful test launch of a new nuclear-powered torpedo with the ability to create radioactive tidal waves targeting coastal regions.\n\nThe Poseidon reportedly has a range of 10,000km (6,200 miles) and travels at 185km/h (115mph). As with previous unveilings of Russian weapons, Putin said, “There’s nothing like it in the world, its rivals are unlikely to appear anytime soon, and there are no existing interception methods”.\n\nDuma Defence Committee Chairman Andrey Kartapolov said the Poseidon was“capable of disabling entire states”.\n\nThree days earlier, Putin had announced the successful test of a new nuclear-capable cruise missile, the Burevestnik, which is also nuclear-powered.\n\n“It is a unique ware which nobody else in the world has,” Putin said.\n\nRussia followed a similar political intimidation tactic in November 2024, when it launched the  Oreshnik , a hypersonic, intermediate-range ballistic, nuclear-capable missile, to hit a Ukrainian factory in Dnipro. On Tuesday, Putin said he would deploy the Oreshnik in Belarus by December.\n\nRussia also tested the Sarmat, a new intercontinental ballistic missile that Putin said is not yet operational, in the Sea of Japan. None of the tests were independently verified, and it was unclear whether any of the new weapons were battle-ready or whether they could be produced at scale.\n\nOn October 22, Moscow conducted a routine strategic forces exercise, sending Tupolev-22M3 long-range bombers over the Baltic Sea, framing it as a reaction to Western aggression.\n\nTrump  said on Monday that Putin should instead focus on ending the war.\n\n“I don’t think it’s an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying,” said the US president. “You ought to get the war ended; the war that should have taken one week is now in … its fourth year, that’s what you ought to do instead of testing missiles.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/pakistan-afghanistan-to-resume-talks-amid-tensions-over-border-clashes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:30:38+00:00","title":"Pakistan, Afghanistan to resume talks amid tensions over border clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to resume border talks in Istanbul, following failed negotiations over the use of Afghan soil for terrorism, particularly concerning the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

Pakistan, Afghanistan to resume talks amid tensions over border clashes\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan –  Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to resume talks in Istanbul at the request of mediator Turkiye after earlier rounds between Islamabad and Kabul  failed  to resolve spiralling tensions between the neighbours that have exploded into military clashes in recent weeks.\n\nPakistani security officials said Islamabad’s delegation had been planning to depart from the Turkish city after a previous round of talks, spanning four days, ended in a deadlock. Now, however, the team will remain in Istanbul to continue negotiations on Thursday.\n\n“Pakistan has once again stressed that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. We appreciate the constructive role of our hosts and remain committed to seeking a peaceful resolution in good faith,” a security official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the dialogue.\n\nAfghan media have also reported, quoting sources, that after the intervention of host Turkiye and mediator Qatar, the two countries have agreed to resume their talks, which had ended earlier this week.\n\nThe two neighbours were engaged in a  weeklong border conflict  this month in which both sides suffered casualties. After the skirmishes, mediation by Qatar and Turkiye led to a ceasefire signed by the defence ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan on  October 19 in Doha  in the presence of officials from both mediating nations.\n\nThe subsequent round of talks began in  Istanbul on Saturday  and continued for four days, but the parties failed to reach a consensus on Islamabad’s central demand that Kabul crack down on Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an armed group often called the Pakistan Taliban, which has been long accused by Pakistan of carrying out deadly attacks inside its territory.\n\nThe TTP emerged in 2007 during the US-led “war on terror” and has since waged a sustained campaign against the Pakistani state. Islamabad accuses Kabul of providing sanctuary not only to the TTP but also to other armed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP). The Afghan Taliban denies the allegations.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban, who took power for a second time in August 2021 after the withdrawal of US forces, has maintained that the TTP issue is an internal Pakistani matter. They have also long considered ISKP a rival and enemy.\n\nAfter Pakistan confirmed the failure of the previous talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a lengthy statement on X, warning of an all-out attack against the Afghan Taliban. He accused the “regime” of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them.”\n\n“The warmongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage,” Asif wrote on Wednesday.\n\nSo far, the Afghan Taliban has not responded to Asif’s remarks.\n\nSweden-based security researcher Abdul Sayed, who studies armed groups in South and Central Asia, said Asif’s comments signalled that Pakistan was prepared to resume air strikes in Afghanistan but the decision to return to negotiations reflected a potential shift.\n\n“The resumption of dialogue suggests either that the issue causing the earlier deadlock has been resolved or that the Pakistani delegation, at the mediators’ request, has shown flexibility in its stance to make another attempt to resolve the matter through negotiation,” Sayed told Al Jazeera.\n\nAsif, in an interview to a TV channel on Wednesday, also alleged that India was waging a “low intensity” war in Pakistan through the Afghan Taliban, claiming Islamabad possesses evidence of Indian involvement. He, however, did not share any evidence to back his claim.\n\nPakistan and India engaged in a  four-day conflict  in May. While New Delhi accuses Islamabad of harbouring armed groups that launch cross-border attacks, Pakistan has historically alleged that India supports Baloch separatist groups demanding an independent Balochistan, Pakistan’s mineral-rich province.\n\nThis year, however, also saw a thaw in relations between the Afghan Taliban and the Indian government. A series of meetings and diplomatic exchanges culminated in a  visit to New Delhi  by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi this month.\n\nSayed noted the recent escalation along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border began during Muttaqi’s visit to India.\n\n“Pakistan has long maintained that India uses Afghan territory to create challenges for it. Even during the rule of the Afghan Taliban, traditionally Pakistan’s longstanding allies, these concerns persisted,” he said.\n\n“Within the tensions of Islamabad-Kabul relations, India remains a crucial factor,” Sayed added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/more-than-130-killed-how-did-a-brazil-raid-on-a-rio-favela-turn-so-deadly","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:44:56+00:00","title":"More than 130 killed: How did a Brazil raid on a Rio favela turn so deadly?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A state police operation in Rio de Janeiro targeting the Red Command gang in the Penha and Alemao Complexes resulted in the deaths of 132 people—the deadliest police raid in Brazil’s history.

Brazil raid on a Rio favela turn so deadly?\n\nA state police operation targeting a major drug gang in Brazil has resulted in the deaths of 132 people in low-income neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro – the deadliest  raid  in the country’s history.\n\nAuthorities initially said fewer than half that number had been killed in the favelas – the Portuguese term for slum. Protests against excessive police force have since broken out and activists are calling for Rio’s governor to resign over what local people have described as a “slaughter”.\n\nState police said the operation carried out on Tuesday had been planned for months. The “sting” aimed to drive suspects into a forested hillside where special operation units were waiting to ambush them.\n\nThe following day, dozens of favela residents gathered in front of the state government headquarters shouting “assassins!” just hours after family members laid dozens of bodies out on a street in one of the targeted areas.\n\nAmong those expressing shock about the death toll was President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. According to Brazil’s justice minister, Lula was “astonished” that the federal government had not been informed about or asked to cooperate in the operation beforehand.\n\nArriving on foot and in armoured cars, police launched a predawn raid targeting the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) gang, one of Brazil’s oldest criminal organisations, in Rio’s northern neighbourhoods of Penha Complex and Alemao Complex.\n\nThe gang, which originated in Rio’s prisons in the 1970s, has expanded in recent years and now commands territory across Brazil, including in the Amazon. Its criminal activities include drug trafficking, arms trafficking and protection racketeering.\n\nTuesday’s assault involved 2,500 police and soldiers. Many were waiting in wooded areas – where most of the killings occurred – close to the targeted sites. Red Command fired back at the government forces, sparking scenes of chaos across the two neighbourhoods.\n\nSchools in the affected areas were closed, a local university cancelled its classes and several roads were blocked off. Elsewhere, many shops in the two districts closed on Wednesday.\n\nRio state Governor Claudio Castro, a far-right ally of former President Jair Bolsonaro, said forensic work was still under way. For now, he maintained, the official death toll was 58, including four police officers.\n\nHowever, the public defender’s office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, reported that the figure was actually 132.\n\nAfter the raid, the state government said 118 weapons and more than a tonne of drugs were seized. On Wednesday, Castro called the operation a “success”. He spoke in a video on X and called the raid a “historic day in the fight against crime in Rio de Janeiro”.\n\nSigo acompanhando de perto esse dia histórico no combate à criminalidade no Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAcabo de tomar uma decisão importante para o nosso estado, que vai nos ajudar a definir os próximos passos nessa luta.  pic.twitter.com/seFOP9JmIu\n\n— Cláudio Castro (@claudiocastroRJ)  October 28, 2025\n\nSupreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Castro to provide information about the police operation and scheduled a hearing with the governor and the heads of the military and civil police on Monday in Rio.\n\nOn Wednesday, residents in Penha gathered next to dozens of bodies laid out in a square, shouting “justice!” before forensic authorities arrived to retrieve the remains.\n\nRafael Soares, a Brazilian crime journalist, told the BBC that Red Command had been on the offensive in Rio de Janeiro in recent years, reclaiming territory it had lost to its main rival, First Capital Command.\n\nPolice raids against criminal organisations are not uncommon in Brazil’s favelas and often turn deadly.\n\nAccording to Soares, however, police operations in which more than 20 people die are “very rare” in Brazil. And most of those happen in Rio.\n\nBefore this, the city’s most deadly police raid occurred in 2021 when 29 people were killed in the Jacarezinho neighbourhood . In 2022 in another raid on the Alemao Complex involving 400 officers, helicopters and armoured vehicles, 19 people were killed.\n\nAnd 111 prisoners were killed in Sao Paulo in 1992 when police stormed the Carandiru Penitentiary to quash a rebellion.\n\nOn a visit to the state of Ceara on Tuesday, Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski called the raid “very bloody” and offered his condolences to the families of those “innocent people” killed. He said Lula was “horrified” by the scale of the fatalities.\n\nBut the government will also be monitoring how the public responds. National violence is a key issue before national elections next year. Nearly 50 percent of Brazilians think security has deteriorated under Lula, according to a survey by Parana Pesquisas, a national pollster.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lula took to social media to  say  that organised crime in Brazil “continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence across cities”.\n\nThe previous day, opposition lawmakers accused the president of protecting criminal groups. “The traffickers’ president must be upset. He lost voters in Rio,” Gilvan da Federal told Congress, referring to gang members killed in the Rio de Janeiro operation.\n\nThe brutality of this week’s raid has drawn criticism from Marta Hurtado, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\n“We fully understand the challenges of having to deal with violent and well-organised groups such as Red Command,” she said.\n\nBut she also called on Brazil to “break this cycle of extreme brutality and ensure that law enforcement operations comply with international standards regarding the use of force”.\n\nCesar Munoz, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, called the deaths a “tragedy”. He added that “the succession of lethal operations that do not result in greater safety for the population but that in fact cause insecurity reveals the failure of the policies of Rio de Janeiro.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, but the content is incomplete or unavailable as the live page has been closed.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season to form in the Caribbean, is threatening multiple islands including Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic with life-threatening flooding and landslides due to heavy rainfall.

National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.\n\nThe centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.\n\nA hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.\n\nAlready, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.\n\nJamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.\n\nThe forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nThe storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.\n\nIn the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.\n\nMore than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.\n\n“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMelissa is also forecast to strike eastern Cuba as a major hurricane on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/spinning-genocide-how-israel-is-using-us-pr-firms-to-frame-its-gaza-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:26:48+00:00","title":"Spinning genocide: How is Israel using US PR firms to frame its Gaza war?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has engaged at least three public relations firms—Bridges Partners, Show Faith by Works, and Clock Tower X—through the European Havas Media Group to influence public perception in the United States, particularly among Evangelical Christians and Gen Z audiences.

Spinning genocide: How is Israel using US PR firms to frame its Gaza war?\n\nIsrael has contracted at least three public relations companies to bolster its image online and among the United States’ Christian right, filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) show.\n\nAccording to US Department of Justice records, Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs hired the newly established Bridges Partners, the Christian PR agency Show Faith by Works, and the online consultancy Clock Tower X via the European Havas Media Group.\n\nAll of the companies contracted promise to help bolster the country’s online image and restore  support  among young right-wing and Evangelical US voters that  polling  suggests is haemorrhaging as a result of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nIsrael is acutely conscious of the need to control how its war, in which it has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, is  perceived  by its allies and sponsors in the  US .\n\nA study of Israel’s online activity published by the Al Jazeera Centre for Studies in May found a coordinated social media campaign to sway international sympathies in its favour throughout the conflict, which began in October 2023.\n\nBut while Israel was able to garner favourable coverage from traditional US media outlets in the early months of the war, it was losing the battle on social media, where videos revealing the mass killing and devastation in Gaza were going viral, and generating sympathy for the Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recognised this, referring to social media as a “weapon” in Israel’s campaign to shore up support in the US – and saying that the purchase of TikTok by a consortium led by pro-Israel billionaires was a “most important purchase”.\n\nI had the honor of asking Bibi Netanyahu about Charlie Kirk’s assassination & the potential loss of evangelical support for the state of Israel.  pic.twitter.com/XP2faZQa0N\n\n— Debra Lea (@thedebralea)  September 26, 2025\n\nEach of the PR companies contracted through Havas promises a fresh approach in that campaign, targeting key demographics, religious groups and even the way the war is discussed online.\n\nAccording to its  FARA filing , Show Faith by Works has been hired by Israel to run a $3.2m outreach and digital targeting campaign to foster “positive associations with the Nation of Israel” in churches in the US and portray “the Palestinian population” as “extremist”.\n\nIn documents enclosed in the FARA filing, Show Faith by Works also promises Israel that it will conduct “the largest Geofencing and Christian Targeting campaign in US history”.\n\nGeofencing targets and tracks the communication devices of users when they come into proximity of a specific location or area – in this case, Christian universities or churches identified by the PR company.\n\nThe company is also planning what it calls a mobile “10/7 Experience” – referring to the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel – which could be taken to Christian colleges, churches, and events.\n\nAccording to the filings, the experience would include a “VR headset, set pieces, full-length TVs for interactive experience” of the attack, during which  1,139 people  were killed and about 250 taken captive.\n\nThe company details that it can also offer the participation of “Christian Celebrity Spokespeople” such as actors Chris Pratt and Jon Voight – the latter an outspoken supporter of US President Donald Trump.\n\nClock Tower claims in its  FARA filing  that it has been engaged to connect with the Gen Z age demographic through social media platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram and to engage with artificial intelligence (AI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok. The activities officially aim to “combat anti-Semitism” – a term often deployed by the Israeli government to counter criticism of its genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nIn its filing, Clock Tower promises to use AI modelling to ensure that the Israeli-supervised campaign – and by extension narratives – are prominent online during the course of its war on Gaza.\n\n“If you can create enough online noise, through either social media or highly ranked websites, you’re able to influence AI’s large language models [like ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok],” said Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor of media analytics and an expert in disinformation at Northwestern University Qatar.\n\n“LLMs [large language models] are trained on a set amount of data, where they scrape large amounts of [historical] information. However, many models such as Grok, ChatGPT or Gemini use what they call retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where they also pull contemporary data from websites and social media,” Jones said.\n\n“What companies like Clock Tower X are promising is that, if they can flood the information space with sites and content sympathetic to Israel – what’s called RAG poisoning –  there’ll be enough there to at least muddy the waters around what others see as a clear-cut genocide.”\n\nClock Tower, headed by former Donald Trump aide Brad Parscale, also says that much of this content will be integrated with that of right-wing Christian network Salem Media, which in  April  announced a strategic partnership with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.\n\nThe campaign promised by Bridges Partners has already become the source of an online meme – but not in the way the company or Israel would have been hoping.\n\nBridges Partners’ campaign  involves an unnamed cohort of between 14 and 18 influencers who would be paid to post in support of Israel. After breaking down the figures included by Bridges Partners in their invoices to Havas, Responsible Statecraft – the Quincy Institute’s online magazine – found that the influencers were likely being paid around $7,000 per post.\n\nThe number has been quickly seized upon by detractors of Israel, who regularly post the amount underneath posts they suspect of being part of the pro-Israel campaign, indicating that they believe the poster has been “bought” by Israel.\n\nResponsible Statecraft  reported  earlier this month that the anonymity of the US influencers, who under the terms of their agreements would post paid pro-Israel content since July, could potentially be illegal if their identities remain undisclosed.\n\nAt present, the Bridges Partners filing names only one registered foreign agent: consultant Uri Steinberg, who holds a 50 percent stake in the company.\n\nIt is too early to say whether the campaign will ultimately be successful. But the backlash towards the arrangement once it became public illustrates just how difficult the task will be for Israel to change perceptions that have now become deeply ingrained, particularly among younger people.\n\n“No matter what artificial data is produced, it still won’t be enough to counter the volume of factual reporting of the war on Gaza,” Jones said.\n\n“However, there might be enough to promote a sense of ambiguity over it, to present both sides as more equal in the conflict, or to present Israel’s response to the attack of October 7 as more reasonable than some now think it is.”\n\nAl Jazeera has been unable to contact Bridges Partners, Clock Tower X, or Show Faith by Works for comment.\n\nInquiries to the Israeli chief of staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eran Shayovich, and to Havas Media Group have also gone unanswered.\n\nIn part two of this investigation, to be published on Friday, Al Jazeera will be looking at why Israel is so focused on changing perceptions of it in the United States."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/thousands-of-ultra-orthodox-rally-in-jerusalem-against-military-service","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:08:21+00:00","title":"Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jews rally in Jerusalem against military service","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a large-scale protest in Jerusalem, tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews gathered to oppose mandatory military service, with over 200,000 attendees expressing religious opposition and carrying slogans that equate conscription with a threat to Judaism.

uncertainty as US food aid set to lapse amid government shutdown\n\nMillions of people in the United States who rely on nutrition assistance programmes are facing uncertainty, as food aid is set to lapse on Saturday amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a state of emergency on Thursday, joining other  state and municipal officials  who tapped local funds to help fill the void.\n\n“I’m declaring a State of Emergency to use every tool we have to help the three million New Yorkers losing food assistance because of the GOP shutdown,” Hochul said in a social media post.\n\nRhode Island, Virginia and New Mexico have also announced emergency declarations in recent days to address the crisis.\n\nWhile federal services often face complications or interruptions during government shutdowns, the Trump administration’s decision to completely suspend  food benefits  starting on November 1 is unusual.\n\nNever before has the federal government frozen funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), sometimes referred to as food stamps.\n\nDemocrats have accused the White House of politicising food aid to pressure politicians to fall in line with Trump’s priorities.\n\nTwenty-five Democrat-led states have sued to ensure SNAP continues to receive funding, and on Thursday, a hearing was held in a federal court in Massachusetts.\n\n“With the suspension of SNAP benefits, the nutritional needs of millions of school-aged children in Plaintiff States will not be met,” the plaintiffs wrote in a filing.\n\nThey also argued that grocers and other merchants who work with food assistance programmes would be adversely affected.\n\nUS District Judge Indira Talwani indicated that she planned to issue a decision later that day.\n\nTalwani also said that the government should find an “equitable way of reducing benefits” as an alternative instead of ending them entirely.\n\nAbout 42 million people — or one out of every eight people in the US — rely on federal nutrition assistance, which constitutes a key part of US  anti-poverty efforts .\n\nSNAP costs nearly $8bn a month for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to operate, and previously, the department had drawn from its contingency funds to keep food assistance flowing.\n\nBut this time, the Trump administration has argued that it is not able to access those funds as part of the government shutdown, which has pitted Democrats against Republicans.\n\nThe two sides reached an impasse over whether to negotiate for greater healthcare access and failed to pass a budget bill by the September 30 deadline.\n\nThe USDA then announced it was severing SNAP funds on October 26, blaming Democrats for failing to fund the government.\n\n“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the USDA wrote in a statement on its website. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.”\n\nThat announcement left state and municipal officials scrambling to find ways to assist residents who could otherwise struggle to access food. Nonprofit food pantries and other services are also bracing for an uptick in demand.\n\nCivil society groups have expressed particular alarm at the possible impact that benefit cuts could have on vulnerable groups, such as children and the poor.\n\n“As this government shutdown continues, the US bishops are deeply alarmed that essential programs that support the common good, such as SNAP, may be interrupted,” the US Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a statement.\n\n“This would be catastrophic for families and individuals who rely on SNAP to put food on the table and places the burdens of this shutdown most heavily on the poor and vulnerable of our nation, who are the least able to move forward.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:32:14+00:00","title":"Trump announces lowest refugee admission cap in US history at 7,500","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced the lowest refugee admission cap in U.S. history, limiting annual entries to just 7,500 for fiscal year 2026.

–  United States President Donald Trump has announced the lowest refugee admission cap in the country’s history, limiting entry to just 7,500 people for the fiscal year 2026.\n\nIn a presidential document published on Thursday but dated September 30, the Trump administration indicated that the US refugee system would remain largely closed to the millions of people around the world fleeing unsafe conditions.\n\nInstead, priority for the 7,500 available slots would be given to white Afrikaners from South Africa.\n\n“The admissions numbers shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa pursuant to Executive Order 14204 and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands,” the document said.\n\nTrump has  repeatedly said  white South Africans are being persecuted in the Black-majority country, a claim rejected by South Africa’s government and top Afrikaner officials.\n\nThursday’s filings also indicated that the Trump administration would narrow the groups that handle refugee services moving forward.\n\nRefugee resettlement grants and contracts that currently go to an array of public and private organisations will instead be rerouted to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“The transfer ensures better alignment of resources, oversight, and accountability [of] resettlement activities that take place entirely within the United States,” a separate declaration said.\n\nTrump’s refugee cap is the lowest since Congress passed the  Refugee Act of 1980 , which codified a formal process for admitting and relocating refugees to the US.\n\nSince then, at least two million refugees have arrived through the US Refugee Admissions Program or USRAP. Trump sought to suspend the programme upon taking office, prompting a successful legal challenge from immigrant rights groups.\n\nThursday’s cap of 7,500 is only a fraction of the 125,000 refugees allowed to enter under former President Joe Biden during his final year in office. The new, lower cap is set to last from October 2025 through September 2026.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently 42.7 million refugees globally.\n\nThe US Refugee Act allows presidents to set a cap on the number of annual refugee admissions, but there is no bottom limit. That has long sparked concerns that Trump, who slashed admissions during his first term, could effectively grind USRAP to a halt.\n\nIn a post on the social media platform X, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted that Trump’s declaration appeared to shift the definition of whom Washington considers to be a refugee.\n\n“Trump’s new refugee determination appears to call for admitting refugees who wouldn’t meet the definition of refugee — someone who faces persecution (not ‘discrimination’) on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” he wrote.\n\nHe added that, for decades, the US refugee programme has admitted “people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors”.\n\n“Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,” he said. “What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”\n\nThe International Refugee Assistance Project, meanwhile, said that Trump did not appear to follow the required congressional consultation process before announcing the cap. The group dismissed the move as baldly political.\n\n“Today’s announcement highlights just how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world,” the organisation’s president, Sharif Aly, said in a statement.\n\n“America’s refugee program was built to reflect our values, and the thousands of individuals we’ve closed our doors to represent thousands of missed opportunities of people who could have strengthened a local community or economy,” the statement said.\n\nTrump’s declaration did not give a reason for the massive cut in refugee admissions, saying only that the number was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.\n\nThe US president has led a massive crackdown on all forms of immigration since taking office, but some advocates had hoped that the refugee programme — which historically had broad bipartisan support — might be spared.\n\nThe  cross-aisle support  has been buoyed in recent years by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with many politicians supporting pathways to immigration for Afghans who worked alongside the US military or allied forces and companies.\n\nMany Afghans have relied on the refugee programme while other specialised immigration programmes remain constricted or backlogged.\n\nSince taking office for a second term, Trump, however, has focused heavily on white Afrikaners. In February, for instance, Trump issued Executive Order 14204 to cut aid to South Africa, on the basis that it demonstrated “shocking disregard” for Afrikaners.\n\nThat order also prioritised humanitarian relief, including refugee admissions, to white South Africans, on the basis that they were “victims of unjust racial discrimination”.\n\nThe first plane carrying white South Africans admitted under the new programme landed in the US in May."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/turkiyes-erdogan-urges-germany-to-help-end-israels-genocide-in-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:36:21Z","title":"Turkiye’s Erdogan urges Germany to help end Israel’s ‘genocide’ in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has criticized Germany for allegedly ignoring what he describes as Israel’s 'genocide' in Gaza, urging both nations to intervene through humanitarian organizations like the German and Turkish Red Crosses to end famine and mass casualties.

ignorance of Israel’s “genocide” and attacks on Gaza.\n\nAt a joint news conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Ankara on Thursday, Erdogan noted Israel’s access to nuclear and other

Gaza,” Erdogan said. “Turkiye and Germany are two key countries that can join hands to achieve this.”\n\nDespite a  fragile US-brokered ceasefire that took effect  on October 10, Israel launched a

wartorn Sudan are recounting scenes of horrific violence at the hands of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) as aid workers say they fear only a fraction of the besieged city’s residents have managed to escape.\n\nThe RSF has killed at least 1,500 people in el-Fasher, capital of North Darfur state,  since seizing it Sunday , according to the Sudan Doctors Network, including at least 460 at a hospital in a widely-condemned massacre.\n\nMore than 36,000 people have fled since Saturday, largely on foot, to Tawila, a town around 70 kilometres (43 miles) west that is already sheltering roughly 650,000 displaced people.\n\nHayat, a mother of five children, told the AFP news agency via satellite phone that seven RSF fighters ransacked her home, searched her undergarments and killed her 16-year-old son in front of her.\n\nAs she fled with neighbours, “we saw many dead bodies lying on the ground and wounded people left behind in the open because their families couldn’t carry them,” she recalled.\n\nAnother survivor named Hussein was wounded by shelling but made it to Tawila with the help of a family carrying their mother on a donkey cart.\n\n“The situation in El-Fasher is so terrible – dead bodies in the streets, and no one to bury them,” he said. We’re grateful we made it here, even if we only have the clothes we were wearing.”\n\nAisha Ismael, another displaced person from el-Fasher recounted to The Associated Press news agency: “Shelling and drones (attacks) were happening all the time. They hit us with the back of the rifles day and night unless we hid in the houses. At 3 in the morning we sneaked outside the houses till we arrived Hillat Alsheth (area in north Darfur) where we were looted. They left us with nothing, I came here barefoot, even my shoes were taken.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from Khartoum, said thousands of people are continuing to flee el-Fasher. She cited the Sudan Doctors Network, which tracks the country’s civil war, as saying that at least 15,000 people have arrived to Tawila “in the past 48 hours alone”.\n\n“Many of them are in desperate need of medical assistance as a result of walking for days without food and water, and suffering injuries,” Morgan said.\n\nMathilde Vu, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which manages the Tawila camp, told the Associated Press “the number of people who made it to Tawila is very small”.\n\n“Where are the others?” she said. “That tells the horror of the journey.”\n\nThe United Nations humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, warned that the “catastrophic levels of human suffering, has descended into an even darker hell” in el-Fasher.\n\nIn an address to the UN Security Council, which has held an emergency meeting on the situation in Sudan on Thursday, Fletcher expressed alarm over reports of mass killings by the RSF, saying the “horror is continuing … with utter impunity”.\n\nRaising the alarm over the dire humanitarian situation in Tawila, he noted that the area is “already hosting hundreds of thousands of people displaced by previous attacks” and is now at breaking point.\n\nThose who attempted to flee to Tawila in the southwest face “extortion, rape”, while men have been “abducted or killed on the road”, Fletcher said.\n\nAccording to him, attempts to bring in aid have been blocked by the RSF.\n\nThe United Nations moved to approve a $20 million allocation for Sudan from the Central Emergency Response Fund to help scale up response efforts in Tawila and elsewhere in Darfur, UN Secretary-General spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday.\n\nThe UN was “horrified” by the slaughter of more than 450 people at Saudi Hospital, where patients, health workers and residents had sought shelter, Dujarric added.\n\nElderly people, the wounded and those with disabilities remained “stranded and unable to flee the area”, he said.\n\nShayna Lewis, a Sudan specialist, told Al Jazeera the massacre of civilians was “most devastating because we in civil society have been warning the international community for over a year about the atrocity risks for the civilian population of North Darfur”.\n\nFor 18 months before Sudan’s army withdrew from the city, an RSF siege had trapped hundreds of thousands of people trapped inside without food or essentials.\n\nWhat’s most “astonishing”, Lewis added, was the ability to see the bloodshed from outer space: Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) reported  satellite imagery shows clusters of objects consistent with human bodies  and large areas of red discolouration on the ground."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/is-trump-launching-a-new-nuclear-arms-race-with-first-us-tests-in-33-years","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:23:27+00:00","title":"Is Trump launching a new nuclear arms race with first US tests in 33 years?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced in October 2025 that he had ordered the immediate restart of U.S. nuclear weapons testing — the first such action in over 30 years.

new nuclear arms race with first US tests in 33 years?\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump  said  on Thursday that he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart testing of US nuclear weapons.\n\nIf the US resumes nuclear testing now, it would be the first time it has conducted such tests in more than 30 years.\n\nTrump claimed that China was rapidly building its nuclear stockpile, citing that as among the reasons to justify his decision, just before he began a much-anticipated summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping that yielded a deal on tariffs and rare earth metals.\n\nThe US president’s decision also came days after he criticised Russia for testing a new nuclear-powered missile called the Burevestnik.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” The Trump administration has renamed the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nIn the post, Trump said that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nMinutes later, Trump entered a meeting with China’s Xi in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.\n\nIt’s unclear why Trump suggested that China could catch up with the US’s arsenal of nuclear warheads in five years.\n\nIt is true that while the US and Russia have been slowly retiring some of their nuclear weapons, China has been expanding its stockpile – up from 350 in 2022, according to the Federation of American Scientists, to 410 in 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nBut the US’s count of nuclear weapons was still nine times that number – 3,708 in 2023.\n\nIt’s more complicated when it comes to Russia.\n\nOn October 26, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his country had successfully tested the nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile.\n\nA day later, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that Putin should focus on ending the war with Ukraine rather than testing missiles.\n\nOn Wednesday, Putin said Moscow had successfully tested a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone, the Poseidon, on Tuesday. The Russian president said about the Poseidon: “There is nothing like this in the world in terms of the speed and the depth of the movement of this unmanned vehicle – and it is unlikely there ever will be.”\n\nA nuclear-powered platform or weapon – whether an aircraft carrier, missile or drone – draws its propulsion from nuclear fission instead of traditional fuels. But a nuclear-powered object isn’t automatically a nuclear weapon: nuclear power also generates a 10th of the world’s electricity.\n\nA nuclear-capable weapon, like the Poseidon, could, however, become a nuclear weapon: It is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.\n\nBut for now, Russia has tested these weapons without any nuclear warhead.\n\nMost countries stopped testing nuclear weapons after they signed the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) starting from 1996. The treaty emerged amid growing concerns about human health and the environment above the ground, underground and underwater, from nuclear pollution.\n\nThe US conducted its first nuclear test in 1945. In all, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations. The US last tested nuclear weapons in 1992. It signed the CTBT in 1996 but never ratified it.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests, the last of them in 1990. Since the USSR’s dissolution in 1990, Russia – which inherited the former superpower’s nuclear arsenal – has not conducted any nuclear tests. In 1996, Russia signed the CTBT, ratifying it in 2000. But Putin revoked Russia’s ratification of the treaty in 2023.\n\nChina last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests between 1945 and 1996.\n\nThe United Kingdom conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952, with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nSince the CTBT came into effect, 10 nuclear tests have taken place.\n\nIn 1998, India and Pakistan conducted two nuclear tests each. India and Pakistan have never signed the CTBT.\n\nAccording to the UN, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2017. It conducted two tests in 2016. North Korea has also not signed the CTBT.\n\nNine states have nuclear arms, including the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nFor decades, Israel has maintained nuclear ambiguity, also known as “opacity”. It has never publicly confirmed or denied the presence of its nuclear weapons programme.\n\nThe CTBT bans all nuclear explosions, for military and civilian reasons, anywhere on Earth.\n\nBut while the US has signed the CTBT, it is not legally obliged to follow it since Washington never ratified it.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it is expressing general agreement with the treaty’s contents and its intention to comply with the treaty in the future. But it is when a country ratifies a treaty that it confirms that it has completed the necessary domestic legal steps to put the treaty into action. Ratification makes a treaty legally binding for a country under international law.\n\nIf history is any guide, then yes.\n\nThat’s what happened at the dawn of the nuclear age.\n\nAmid Cold War tensions, the US atomic weapons programme became a source of anxiety for the Soviet Union, and a focus of espionage between the rivals. The USSR became the world’s second nation with nuclear weapons after a successful test in 1949.\n\nBritain followed in 1952, and France in 1960.\n\nBy the late 1950s, as China and the Soviet Union split over the direction of the global communist movement and its leadership, Beijing feared military attacks from its northern neighbour. China tested its first nuclear bomb in 1964 – its atomic programme was initially aided in the early 1950s by Moscow.\n\nNuclear one-upmanship was also on display when India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons within days of each other in 1998.\n\nIn June this year, a report by SIPRI warned that the world was on the brink of a  new nuclear arms race .\n\nWhile the overall number of nuclear warheads around the world is falling – largely because the US and Russia have been dismantling old warheads – new warheads are still being produced and added to arsenals.\n\nThe SIPRI report warned that in the absence of agreements that limit or reduce stockpiles, these new additions could eventually outnumber the warheads being decommissioned.\n\nGuardrails that focus on controlling and limiting nuclear arms have weakened in recent years.\n\nIran has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Its  recent threat  came in June during its war with Israel.\n\nThe NPT is an international treaty that was open for signing on July 1, 1968, and came into force on March 5, 1970.\n\nThe treaty decrees that nuclear-weapon states will not transfer nuclear weapons or assist non-nuclear-weapon states in developing them. It also makes non-nuclear-weapon states agree not to seek or acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Israel never signed the NPT. While North Korea signed the treaty in 1985, it withdrew its signature in 2003.\n\nRussia’s withdrawal of its ratification of the CTBT in 2023 means Moscow is no longer obliged to adhere to a no-tests policy.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union signed several treaties and agreements to control the nuclear arms race. However, most of these have lapsed or fallen apart.\n\nFor instance, in 1972, the two signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, but the US withdrew from it in 2002.\n\nIn 1979, both sides negotiated terms for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II (SALT II) treaty. The US signed the treaty but never ratified it, and withdrew from it in 1980 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nIn 1987, the two sides signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The US withdrew from this in 2019, alleging that Russia was violating its terms."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba in late October 2025, causing at least 34 deaths and widespread destruction.

Hurricane Melissa destruction\n\nPeople across the northern Caribbean are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/trump-xi-meeting-in-busan-key-takeaways-from-the-summit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:30:19+00:00","title":"Trump-Xi meeting in Busan: Key takeaways from the summit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a one-hour-and-40-minute summit in Busan, South Korea, marking their first face-to-face meeting since 2019.

Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have  agreed to a trade truce  under which the US will ease tariffs and Beijing will restart imports of US soya beans, delay the introduction of export restrictions on some of its rare earth metals and intensify efforts to curb illegal fentanyl trafficking.\n\nSpeaking after his meeting on Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea – their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 – Trump described the meeting as the capstone of his five-day Asia tour.\n\n“I thought it was an amazing meeting,” Trump told reporters.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nThe short duration of Trump and Xi’s talks – about one hour and 40 minutes – took some observers by surprise.\n\nShan Guo, a partner at the Shanghai-based consultancy Hutong Research, said the “shorter-than-expected” meeting likely suggests both sides limited discussions to topics that had already been settled in advance.\n\nAlthough no official timetable was released, Trump had earlier suggested the talks could last up to four hours.\n\nBut Trump said the result overall was “amazing”, adding that the meeting “was a 12 with 10 being best”.\n\nInstead, the two countries have agreed to a “truce” in their trade war, which has been raging on and off for the past year.\n\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera the agreement could be seen as a “partial freeze” or “minor rollback” in the US-China trade war.\n\nThe two countries agreed to the following for a period of one year – to be renegotiated and renewed after that time:\n\nSemiconductors, which are crucial for the development of artificial intelligence (AI), have been a key source of tension between Washington and Beijing since former US President Joe Biden’s administration imposed export controls on US-made semiconductors to limit China’s access to advanced chips used in AI development.\n\nOne of the most closely watched companies in this dispute is Nvidia, a leading US chipmaker whose processors power most of the world’s AI systems.\n\nNvidia’s new Blackwell AI processors, unveiled this year, are considered central to its dominance in the global AI race and are among the technologies restricted under US export rules.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has tried to persuade the Trump administration to loosen the controls, saying Chinese AI’s dependence on US hardware was good for the US.\n\nDuring his meeting with Xi, Trump said he had discussed semiconductor trade with China but the talks did not involve the Blackwell processors. “China is going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips,” he said, adding, “We’re not talking about the Blackwell.”\n\nThe agreement by China to delay export restrictions on rare earth metals represents another key area of strategic importance in the US-China relationship – one that, like semiconductors, sits at the intersection of trade and technology, and national security.\n\nNo details of the deal have been made public yet, but analysts believe it could be a major “win” for Trump.\n\n“Rare earths are critical for the production of everything from smartphones to headphones to, of course, military defence weaponry, fighter jets and tanks,” Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu said, reporting from Beijing. “This is a national security issue for Trump, and the problem for him is that China dominates this industry.”\n\nChina produces more than 70 percent of the world’s processed rare earth metals and rare earth magnets, according to the Washington, DC-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nYu added that even if a deal has been struck, China is still likely to “use rare earths as leverage in any negotiations it has with the United States going forward”.\n\nSoya beans and fentanyl have long been flashpoints in US-China relations, symbolising the economic and political stakes on both sides.\n\nSoya beans  are the top farm product the US exports abroad, and China is one of the top buyers. During the trade war this year when China and the US slapped each other with tariffs exceeding 100 percent before agreeing a pause in May, China stopped buying US soya beans, causing exports to plunge and hurting farmers across the US Midwest, a key Trump political base.\n\nA resumption of Chinese purchases would provide both an economic boost and a symbolic political win for the Trump administration. However, soya bean futures in Chicago slipped after the summit as traders were disappointed with the lack of concrete details about agricultural commitments.\n\nFentanyl, a highly addictive drug which is 50 times stronger than heroin, remains at the centre of the US opioid crisis, contributing to tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year. Washington has repeatedly accused Chinese suppliers of exporting the precursor chemicals used to manufacture it.\n\nChina previously pushed back on Trump’s accusations, saying it has done more than required to meet its obligations on narcotics control.\n\nAccording to Chinese state media reports on Thursday, Xi told Trump that China does not seek to challenge or replace any other country and instead focuses on “doing its own business well”.\n\nHe described China’s economy as “an ocean”, adding that the country is confident and capable of handling all kinds of risks and challenges.\n\nXi said China-US relations remain generally stable and both sides’ teams should refine and follow up on the consensus reached.\n\nThe reports said Xi also “called on both sides to focus on long-term benefits brought by cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of retaliation”.\n\nBeijing also confirmed Trump’s visit to China next year.\n\nIn response to a reporter’s question, Trump declined to provide more details about this part of the talks but emphasised the scale of potential trade.\n\nThe question of China’s access to Nvidia’s chips remains a major point of US-China tech tension.\n\nEinar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute in Beijing, said Trump’s decision to ease tariffs on Chinese goods from 57 percent to 47 percent “means nothing”.\n\n“Any economist will tell you, tariffs 30 percent or above mean that you effectively end trade,” Tangen told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s kind of an indication to me that there wasn’t as much progress [in these talks] as Donald Trump is trying to hint at,” he added.\n\nTangen said Beijing would have hoped the Trump administration would have lowered its tariffs to 20 or 25 percent, or 30 percent “at most”, putting them “on parity with the rest of the world”.\n\nHe added that until a joint communique is released, it would be hard to gauge just how successful this meeting really was."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, marking a key step in its national space programme.

2025-10-30T14:04:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Zohran Mamdani supporters make final campaign push: Why him, why now?\n\nNew York City -  \"Focus, focus, focus on affordability\".\n\nIt is a simple message, but one that Robert Wood, a 47-year-old writer and a lead volunteer for mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, believes is the key to turning out voters in the final stretch of New York City's closely watched race.\n\nMamdani's surprise victory in the  June Democratic primary  - and his commanding lead in the polls ahead of the November 4 election day - has achieved a symbolism that has resonated far beyond the borders of the city's five boroughs.\n\nTo many, it has represented a rebuke to the wealthy donor-dominated Democratic establishment: A path forward for liberal politics lost in the woods in the age of US President Donald Trump.\n\nBut for a movement that has reverberated across the country - and indeed the globe - to fully actualise, Mamdani supporters know he must actually make it into City Hall. That begins and ends with door-knocking: lots and lots of door-knocking.\n\nIn a row of townhouses in the neighbourhood of Crown Heights, an area that split between Mamdani and top opponent  Andrew Cuomo  in the primaries, a door opened to reveal Nadia on a windswept October day. She said she's already all in for Mamdani.\n\n\"Regardless of what the polls say, we need to make sure our friends and families get out and vote,\" Wood urged, noting a resounding mandate would help to energise Mamdani's  ambitious plans : rent freezes on stabilised apartments, free buses, and universal childcare, paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers.\n\nExecution will require hard-fought buy-in from state lawmakers and the governor.\n\nAt a nearby, pre-war rent-stabilised apartment building, another man said he was unsure. Wood pointed to Mamdani's vow to freeze rents in buildings like his, which make up about a quarter of the city's housing stock.\n\nThe man is gracious, but unwilling to make a final decision: \"Thank you, I'm still deciding\".\n\nDown the street, climbing a steep concrete stoop, Wood met Onika Saul, a 45-year-old property manager. In Mamdani's pledges, she worried, \"realism is kind of skewed\".\n\n\"Anyone can say anything, but action always speaks louder than words,\" she said.\n\n\"So I think for me personally, being disappointed so many times by so many politicians and so many promises, I want to see more action than words.\"\n\nBut Wood dug in. He detailed Mamdani's activism as a state assemblyman, which included joining a taxi worker hunger strike; he had been arrested in front of US Senator Chuck Schumer's home during a protest against US funding for the war in Gaza; Mamdani, he noted, has relied on small donations, unlike the sums provided by billionaire business and real estate leaders who have fuelled Cuomo's campaign.\n\nHe also pointed to an issue that has been one of the most decisive in the race: Mamdani, he noted, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights, a rarity in mainstream US politics.\n\n\"Zohran is certainly the only politician in the race who will call what's happening [in Gaza], what it is: a genocide,\" Wood said.\n\nSaul agreed: \"It is a genocide\".\n\nBy the end, Saul still had her reservations. After all, Mamdani's top pledges —rent freezes and universal childcare for children under five — would not directly apply to her. But she said she's willing to give his vision a shot—and her vote.\n\n\"I feel better about him,\" she said. \"But it’s still the whole seeing is believing thing.\"\n\nMamdani has been trying to bridge that chasm in belief in the final stretch of the election contest. Polls have tightened, with opponent Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York State,  making explicit appeals  to conservatives and independents to back him or face the degradation of the city as they know it.\n\nCuomo, who left office in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations, has  derided  Mamdani as an out-of-touch ideologue promising the impossible. The attacks have included increasingly caustic messaging, leaning into Islamophobic and xenophobic tropes: Mamdani would be the first Muslim, first person born in Africa (Uganda), and the first person of South Asian descent to lead the city.\n\nFor Mamdani, the challenge has been seeing through a mission statement he elucidated after his come-from-behind win in primary elections in June. The 34-year-old state assemblyman was expected to have his mayoral ambitions dashed against the realities of the city's notoriously hard-nosed electoral politics.\n\nInstead, his victory was resounding. He took 56.4 percent of the primary vote when adjusted for the ranked-choice system, compared to Cuomo's 43.6 percent. Cuomo soon after re-entered the race as an independent.\n\n\"We wanted to rebuild a coalition that had frayed over years of disappointment and neglect, to win people back to a Democratic Party that puts working people first,\" Mamdani said after the win, in one of the ubiquitous direct-to-camera social media videos he has used to appeal to a chronically online generation of voters.\n\nHe pointed to areas in New York City that swung towards US President Donald Trump in 2024, only to support him in the primary. It was evidence, he said, that a combination of  progressive policies  and a clear message on affordability could rally the disaffected.\n\n\"The headline is clear: we can win back voters many have written off if we give them something to vote for, not just tell them what to be against,\" he said.\n\nIn the months since, Mamdani has more fully embraced his role as a progressive standard-bearer, twice holding rallies with stalwart US Senator Bernie Sanders, whose surprise surge in the 2016 presidential election offered to many a glimpse of a different political path.\n\nBut the real test is yet to come. Unlike the closed Democratic primary, the general election is open to all, including the approximately 20 percent of the 4.7 million registered voters unaffiliated with a party, as well as the 11 percent registered Republicans. The variables are vast, and electoral math is subject to unseen shifts.\n\nEarly voting, which began on October 25, has already seen record turnouts, particularly in older demographics that favour Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.\n\n\"Please, please, do not underestimate our opponents,\" Sanders said at a rally kicking off the final sprint of the race.\n\nIt is a question that has hung in the air since June: Why is Mamdani the man for this political moment?\n\nAt a bohemian beer garden in Astoria, Queens, where the New York City Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) held a watch party during the first of two general election debates, Susan Kang attempted to unpack the query.\n\nOf course, Mamdani's success comes in the wake of a punishing 2024 election season for Democrats, who lost the US presidency, the House and the Senate to Republicans.\n\nThat exposed \"the weaknesses of a conventional Democratic message\", particularly on economic issues and affordability, explained Kang, an associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan who is also affiliated with the DSA.\n\nCuomo, to many young voters who buoyed Mamdani's success, is emblematic of the same tired Democratic Party of old.\n\nThen there is the continued knock-on of the so-called \"Bernie Sanders effect\", which helped bring Democratic Socialist policies to the fore. While Democratic Socialism is a distinct, if amorphous, ideology, the term \"socialist\" has for decades been a political slur in the post-Cold War US.\n\nBut for Kang, the strength that has carried Mamdani is more personal in provenance.\n\nWhile Cuomo's approach says, \"I'm gonna whip this city into shape\", Kang said, Mamdani shows a warmth and familiarity with the tapestry of personalities that make up the wildly diverse metropolis. One of his most popular videos highlighted common issues facing halal workers. Others have featured deli workers, subway commuters and cab drivers.\n\n\"I think Zohran has really shown that he loves New York City,\" Kang said.  \"He wants to make this a city that works for everybody.\"\n\nIn a second-floor office in South Richmond Hill, Queens, Sherry Padilla believes Mamdani is uniquely positioned to rally immigrant working-class communities who feel left behind by establishment politics.\n\nMamdani's ground game in the run-up to the primary relied heavily not just on the DSA's sprawling volunteer infrastructure, but also on community groups like DRUM Beats, a political committee affiliated with the Queens-headquartered Desis Rising Up and Resisting.\n\nHe has been leveraging that same support as the general election approaches,  continuing to tour mosques , Hindu and Jewish temples, and Christian churches across the five boroughs.\n\nHosting a phone-banking event for DRUM Beats, Padilla said she is hoping to convince voters to see in Mamdani what she sees. Her outreach specifically targets the South Richmond Hill area, home to a large Guyanese and South Asian population.\n\n\"We've had politicians who come into our community, say two or three words in our language and eat one of our favourite foods, and then it's like, 'OK, see you next election season,'\" Padilla said.\n\n\"Zohran's constantly been in our communities and has been by our working class, our Black or brown residents and supported our struggles and fought with us,\" she said. \"That's something that we've never seen before in a politician.\"\n\nIn New York City, nearly 40 percent of the population is foreign-born. Working-class immigrants have had a front-row seat to yawning inequality in the city, which is home to more billionaires than any other city in the world.\n\nStudies have shown that inequality has become more entrenched since the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2021. Prices have risen, but only the wealthiest have seen their incomes significantly increase.\n\nA recent report by the Fiscal Policy Institute found one percent of the city's population currently receives 44 percent of the city's income. The share is nearly four times higher than 30 years ago.\n\nAt a pro-Mamdani rally in Midtown, Manhattan, Salim Drammeh, who leads Africans for Zohran, said the overlap of Mamdani's identity and the policies he spearheads has the potential to invigorate dormant voting blocks.\n\n\"In my district, there is a lot of food insecurity, there's a huge need for childcare,\" he said. \"So when Zohran speaks about affordability, it speaks straight to our communities.\"\n\n\"At the same time, voter turnout in the community is really low,\" he said, noting he helped organise a roundtable with West African imams in the community and Mamdani. \"So I've really been working to increase those numbers\".\n\nAt the same time, the vitriol that Mamdani has received, particularly related to his religion, race and immigration history, has crescendoed in the final days of the race.\n\nIn the final week of campaigning, two House Republicans, Randy Fine and Andy Ogles, have continued to push the US Department of Justice to investigate Mamdani's immigration status and potentially strip his citizenship.\n\nBut Latifa Emery, a 44-year-old from the Morrisania neighbourhood of the Bronx, said those attacks could backfire, instead energising communities long accustomed to being demonised.\n\n\"If he wins, a lot of people will start to realise that we aren't what everybody says we are,\" said Emery, who is Muslim. \"We're not terrorists, we're not bad people. It's time for people to see that\".\n\nIn the nearby Tremont neighbourhood, Masoud Eleshin, a 78-year-old originally from Ghana, took issue with Cuomo's attempts to connect Mamdani to anti-LGBTQ policies in the country where he was born, Uganda.\n\nThat has included attacking Mamdani for taking a photo with Rebecca Kadaga, a proponent of anti-gay laws. Mamdani has flatly condemned Kadaga's position, saying he was not aware of her views at the time the photo was taken.\n\n\"That shouldn't be happening,\" Eleshin said. \"I've been in this country for 40 years; you can't blame me for where I'm from\".\n\nBack on the canvassing grind in Crown Heights, both the pitfalls and potential of reaching new voters were on full display.\n\nThe event was just a slice of the campaign's efforts. Wood's canvassing group included at least 50 participants. All told, the campaign has said about 90,000 volunteers have taken part across the city throughout the election season.\n\nAt one townhouse, a man answered the door and quickly became irate.\n\n\"You're wasting your time in this neighbourhood,\" the man said. \"[Mamdani] is an antisemite, he wants me dead\".\n\nWood attempted to calm the situation, seeking to dispel a claim pushed by both Cuomo and Sliwa. A  range of Jewish New Yorkers  have backed Mamdani, who has repeatedly vowed to be a Mayor for all city residents.\n\nOne of two major ultra-orthodox Satmar sects in the city has also recently rejected claims that Mamdani is antisemitic as \"false and dangerous\".\n\nBut unable to bring the temperature down, Wood moved on.\n\nIn a nearby apartment building, 70-year-old Hedrina James said she had not been following the race, her attention instead consumed wth the daily demands of life.\n\nBut after a quick talk with Wood, she was swiftly taken by two of Mamdani's top pledges: A rent freeze, which would theoretically apply to her apartment, and universal childcare.\n\n“I’ve learned a lot,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"This would benefit so many of us.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30v68ngje7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:09:47.805+00:00","title":"Ontario’s Doug Ford demands apology from US ambassador over tariff 'tirade'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford demanded an apology from US Ambassador Pete Hoekstra after a heated exchange over a government-funded TV ad criticizing President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

apology from the US ambassador to Canada following a tense exchange between the envoy and the province's trade representative.\n\nThe exchange - described by CBC News as “an expletive-laced tirade” - was between US envoy Pete Hoekstra and Ontario trade representative David Paterson over a TV advert criticising Trump's tariffs.\n\nCalling the remarks \"absolutely unacceptable\" and \"unbecoming of an ambassador\", Ford urged Hoekstra to make amends. \"Pete, you gotta call Dave up and apologise. It's simple,\" Ford said.\n\nLast week, President Trump suspended trade talks with Canada over the advert and threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports.\n\n\"You know, the cheese slipped off the cracker. I get it,” Ford said at a press conference on Wednesday, referring to Hoekstra's outburst. “You're ticked off, but call the guy up because you're a good guy, and Dave's my champion.\"\n\nThe advert, which was paid for by the Ontario government, uses a quote from Reagan saying tariffs “hurt every America”, taking excerpts from the former president’s 1987 national radio address focused  on foreign trade.\n\nFord wanted to use the advert to sway public opinion on tariffs in conservative, Trump-backed, areas. The premier has said the ad had “over one billion impressions” and been seen by a global audience.\n\n“What do they expect me to do? Sit back and roll over like every other person in the world,” he said.\n\nThe spot also aired during the first two World Series games between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers, which Ford hailed as \"the most successful ad in North American history\".\n\n“They’re talking about it in the US, and they weren’t talking about it before I put the  ad on,” Ford said.\n\nBut it has frustrated many in the Trump administration, especially President Donald Trump who threatened to hike tariffs on Canada 10% “over and above” current levies in the wake of Ford’s action.\n\nWhen Trump was asked to expand on what the additional tariffs would look like he said, “I don’t know when it’s going to kick in, and we’ll see, but I don’t really want to discuss it”.\n\nThere is currently a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, though most are exempt under  an existing free trade agreement.

temporary truce as China plays longer game\n\nUS President Donald Trump came away from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping full of bombastic optimism.\n\nHe called it a \"great success\" and rated it 12, on a scale of 1 to 10. China was less enthusiastic. Beijing's initial statement sounds like an instruction manual, with Xi urging teams on both sides to \"follow up as soon as possible\".\n\nTrump is after a deal that could happen \"pretty soon\", while Beijing, it appears, wants to keep talking because it's playing the long game.\n\nThere was a more detailed second Chinese statement that echoed what Trump had said on board Air Force One.\n\nAmong other things, the US would lower tariffs on Chinese imports, and China would suspend controls on the export of rare earths - critical minerals without which you cannot make smartphones, electric cars and, perhaps more crucially, military equipment.\n\nThere is no deal yet, and negotiators on both sides have already been talking for months to iron out the details. But Thursday's agreement is still a breakthrough.\n\nIt steadies what has become a rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies and it assures global markets.\n\nBut it is only a temporary truce. It doesn't solve the differences at the heart of such a competitive relationship.\n\n\"The US and China are going in different directions,\" says Kelly Ann Shaw, who was an economic adviser to Trump in his first term.\n\n\"It's really about managing the breakup in a way that does a limited amount of damage, that preserves US interests, and I think from China's perspective, preserves their own interests. But this is not a relationship that is necessarily going to improve dramatically anytime soon.\"\n\nThere is an art to doing a deal with Trump.\n\nIt involves flattery - and most countries have tried it, including on his trip to Asia so far. South Korea gave him an enormous golden crown, while Japan's prime minister  nominated him for a Nobel Peace prize.\n\nBut the Chinese leader offered only a meeting at a South Korean air base, where he and Trump would cross paths - as one flew in to the country, and the other departed.\n\nIt didn't feel out of step with China's guarded but defiant response from the start of Trump's trade war. Just days after the American president increased tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing retaliated with its own levies.\n\nChinese officials told the world that there would be no winners in a trade war. Like Trump, Xi too believed he had the upper hand - and he seemed to have a plan.\n\nHe decided to use the country's economic weight - as the world's factory, as a massive market for its goods - to push back.\n\nUnlike Trump, he does not need to worry about elections or a worried vote base.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Xi faces no pressures - he certainly does. He needs China's economy to grow, and create jobs and wealth so the Chinese Communist Party's power is not challenged by instability or discontent.\n\nAnd yet, despite the country's current challenges - a real estate crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer spending - China has shown it is willing to absorb the pain of Trump's tariffs.\n\nBeijing would \"fight until the bitter end\" was the message from various ministries.\n\n\"China's main principle is struggle, but don't break,\" says Keyu Jin, author of The New China Playbook.\n\n\"And it has escalated to de-escalate, which is a very new tactic.\"\n\nThat is, China hit Trump where it hurt. For the first time, it limited exports of rare earths to the US - and China processes around 90% of the world's rare earth metals.\n\n\"The nuance often missed in the rare earths debate is that China has an overwhelming position over the most strategic bit of the rare earth supply chain -  the heavy rare earths used in advanced defence systems,\" says Jason Bedford, macroeconomics expert and investment analyst.\n\n\"That advantage is far harder to dislodge than other parts of the rare earths industry.\"\n\nSo getting China to relax those export controls became a priority for Washington - and that was a key bit of leverage for Xi when he sat down with Trump.\n\nChina had also stopped buying US soybeans, which was aimed at farmers in Republican states - Trump's base.\n\nReports this week say Beijing has already started buying soybeans from the US again.\n\n\"If the US thinks that it can dominate China, it can suppress China, I think has proven to be wrong,\" Ms Jin says.\n\n\"This is really signalling to the world, especially the United States, that China needs to be respected, that it will not kowtow or give too many political or economic concessions.\"\n\nTrump's team has found itself dealing with a stronger China compared to his first term. Beijing has learnt lessons, too.\n\nIt spent the last four years finding new trade partners and relying less on US exports - nearly a fifth of Chinese exports once went to the US but in the first half of this year that figure dropped to 11%.\n\nXi showed up in South Korea - after officially confirming the meeting with Trump just the day before - to take part in political theatre that seemed to underline a position of strength.\n\nAs usual, he was in front of Trump for the handshake. He stood unblinking as Trump leaned forward to whisper in his ear - the kind of ad lib moment China abhors.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Trump ushered Xi to his waiting car where the Chinese leader was immediately surrounded by his security team. The US president was then forced to wander off camera to find his vehicle alone.\n\nAnd yet, there are many positives to take away from this superpower summit - the first of  Trump's second term in office.\n\n\"China wants to be in a position of strength when it comes to negotiations, but it won't break the relationship, because that is in nobody's interest, including China's,\" Ms Jin says.\n\nFor starters, businesses, the markets and other countries caught in between the rivals will welcome the calm. But observers are not sure it will last.\n\n\"I think over the medium to long-term, the US and China have very serious differences, and I would not be surprised to see some more destabilisation in the next three to six months,\" says Ms Shaw.\n\nHas Trump got the bigger, better deal with China he always wanted? Not yet.\n\nEven if he does get a deal, and the two sides put ink on paper, Beijing has now shown that it is not willing to bend to Washington - and that it is more resilient.\n\nThe rivalry between the two sides is likely to continue, if or even when there is ever a done deal."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j8zn0ex9ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:06:02.650+00:00","title":"Trump's Asia tour sees deals, knee-bending and a revealing Xi meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump’s five-day Asia tour showcased a dramatic contrast between performative diplomacy with allies such as Japan and South Korea — marked by extravagant gestures, gifts, and trade agreements — and a tense, strategic meeting with China's President Xi Jinping.

Trump's Asia tour sees deals, knee-bending and a revealing Xi meeting\n\nUS presidential trips abroad have traditionally been an opportunity to display the power of the American nation on the world stage. Donald Trump's five-day swing through eastern Asia, on the other hand, has been a display of the power of Trump - but also, at times, of that power's limitations.\n\nTrump's stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea over the course of the first four days were an exercise in pleasing a sometimes mercurial American president. It was an acknowledgement that Trump, with the flick of a pen, could impose tariffs and other measures that have the potential to devastate the economies of export-dependent nations.\n\nHis sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, however, was something entirely different.\n\nIt was a meeting of equals on the global stage, where the stakes for both nations – for their economies, for their international prestige, for the welfare of their people - were enormous.\n\nWith China, Trump may flick his pen, but such actions come with consequences. They come with a cost.\n\nFor the first four days, Trump's most recent foray into global diplomacy was smooth sailing.\n\nEach stop was punctuated by a blend of traditional trade negotiations – deals made under the shadow of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs – and personal accommodations that at times bordered on the obsequious.\n\nIn Malaysia, Trump secured access to critical minerals and made progress toward finalising trade arrangements with south-east Asian nations. He also presided over a treaty that should ease border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia – the kind of \"peace deal\" the American president loves to tout.\n\nIn Japan, Trump's Marine One flew past a Tokyo Tower lit red, white and blue – with a top in Trumpian gold.\n\nNewly elected Prime Minister Sanai Takaichi detailed $550bn in Japanese investments in the US and offered the American president a gift of 250 cherry trees for America's 250th birthday, and a golf club and bag that belonged to Shinzo Abe, the assassinated former prime minister who bonded with Trump in his first term.\n\nShe also became the latest foreign leader to nominate Trump for his much-desired Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nNot to be outdone, South Korea welcomed Trump with artillery firing a 21-gun salute and a military band that played Hail to the Chief and YMCA – the Village People song that has become a Trump rally anthem.\n\nPresident Lee Jae Myung held an \"honour ceremony\" for Trump during which he gave the American leader his nation's highest medal and a replica of an ancient Korean dynastic crown.\n\nLunch with Lee featured a \"Peacemaker's Dessert\" of gold-encrusted brownies. Later that day, the Koreans served Trump vineyard wine at an intimate dinner in Trump's honour with six world leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit.\n\nIn the US, Trump may be the subject of \"No Kings\" demonstrations by Americans who disapprove of his boundary-testing expansions of presidential power, but during his East Asia swing he was treated like royalty.\n\nAnd like the kings of old, Trump arrived in Korea seeking tribute – in the form of $200bn in cash payments, $20bn a year, from South Korea to the US, to be invested at the direction of Trump's government. Agreement on the terms of those payments helped ensure that the tariff rate on South Korean exports to the US would drop from 25% to 15%.\n\nThe main event of Trump's Asia trip came in its final hours, however, as he met with Xi.\n\nThere, the power dynamic between leaders of the world's two largest economies was decidedly different than the interactions Trump had with his foreign counterparts in previous days.\n\nMissing were all the pomp and the pageantry. No military bands, no honour guards, no carefully crafted menus celebrating mutual national affection. Instead, the two leaders and their top aides sat across a long white negotiating table in a nondescript military building just off the runway of Busan's international airport.\n\nIt was perhaps a reflection of the high stakes that when Trump shook hands with Xi in Busan, he appeared tense. It was a far cry from his relaxed attitude when he told me the day before that he was optimistic he would have a good meeting.\n\n\"I know a little bit about what's going on because we have been talking to them,\" he said. \"I'm not just walking into a meeting cold.\"\n\nFor months, Trump had been threatening higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the US – as a source of revenue for the American treasury as well as to pressure China to open its markets and control the export of chemicals used to make the drug fentanyl.\n\nChina, unlike many of America's other trading partners, responded with escalation, not concessions.\n\nIf tariffs were a source of economic hardship for China, then Beijing would target America's vulnerabilities. It suspended purchase of US agricultural products and proposed export controls on its large supply of critical minerals - resources that the US, and much of the world, rely on for high-tech manufacturing.\n\nTrump's mood was upbeat after the meeting, which he described as \"amazing\" and graded a 12 on a scale of 1-10. The president appeared in a good mood even as the plane jostled from rough turbulence as it climbed into the sky.\n\nBut it was a battle of wills and economic pain set the two nations on a path that ultimately led to Thursday's meeting and an agreement on both sides to de-escalate.\n\nThe US lowered its tariffs, while China eased access to critical minerals, and pledged to resume importing US agricultural products and increase purchases of US oil and gas.\n\nWhile it may not have been a breakthrough, it was an acknowledgement by both sides that the existing situation was unsustainable.\n\nThe international order that will take its place, however, is far from clear. As Xi acknowledged in his opening remarks at the bilateral meeting, China and the US \"do not always see eye to eye with each other\".\n\n\"It is normal for the two leading economies in the world to have frictions now and then,\" he said.\n\nThat may represent an improved outlook after months of tension, but it was also an sign that \"frictions\" are here to stay.\n\nChina has global and regional ambitions and a growing willingness to expand its influence.\n\nTrump, for his part, has attempted to reorder American priorities abroad, using US economic might to pressure allies and adversaries alike. And it is those American allies – nations like Japan and South Korea that have long relied on American political, economic and military support -  that are scrambling to adjust to the new reality.\n\nSome of that scrambling comes in the form of  a bend-backward willingness to accommodate Trump in forms large and small. Gifts and dinnertime honours are easy, but multibillion dollar payments, increased military spending and permanent tariffs take a toll.\n\nAnd they could ultimately prompt a reevaluation of relations with America – and, as a result, with China.\n\nTrump may have received a king's welcome in South Korea, but, in what could be viewed as a bit of on-point symbolism, as he departed, it was Xi who was arriving. And the Chinese leader's Korean hosts had promised a diplomatic reception equal to that received by the Americans.\n\nXi is fully participating in the Apec leaders meetings – proceedings that Trump chose to skip. If there is a vacuum created by America's international manoeuvres, it is a void China appears more than willing to fill.\n\nTrump may be returning to America with everything he wanted from this trip. But, in a twist on the Rolling Stones song that he used to play at his political rallies, it's not yet clear that he got what America needs."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gj90j2g8jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:39:25.934+00:00","title":"Israel receives coffins Hamas says contain two Gaza hostages' bodies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has received two coffins from Gaza, reportedly containing the bodies of two Israeli hostages, Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to Hamas.

has received via the Red Cross in Gaza two coffins which the Palestinian armed group Hamas says contain the bodies of deceased hostages, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.\n\nIsraeli forces will now transfer the bodies to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.\n\nHamas's armed wing announced earlier that it had recovered the bodies of Israeli hostages Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza.\n\nIt said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.\n\nThe Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.\n\nThe Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".\n\nHamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".\n\nHours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.\n\nHamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".\n\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.\n\nUS President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.\n\nUnder the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.\n\nAll the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\n\nIsrael has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.\n\nEleven of the 13 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.\n\nAll but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.\n\nIsrael responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c364k5e9g58o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:06:18.630+00:00","title":"Photographer on Rio police raid: 'The bodies just kept coming'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive police operation in Rio de Janeiro targeted the Comando Vermelho gang, resulting in over 130 deaths — including police officers — marking the deadliest such raid in the city's history.

Janeiro has told the BBC of how residents came back with mutilated bodies of those who had died.\n\nThe bodies \"kept coming: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45...\", Bruno Itan told BBC Brasil. They included those of police officers.\n\nOne of the bodies had been decapitated - others were \"totally disfigured\", he said. Many also had what he says were stab wounds.\n\nMore than 120 people were killed during Tuesday's raid on a criminal gang - the deadliest such raid in the city.\n\nBruno Itan told BBC Brasil that he was first alerted to the raid early on Tuesday by residents of the Alemão neighbourhood, who sent him messages telling him there was a shoot-out.\n\nThe photographer made his way to the Getúlio Vargas hospital, where the bodies were arriving.\n\nItan says that the police stopped members of the press from entering the Penha neighboorhood, where the operation was under way.\n\n\"Police officers formed a line and said: 'The press doesn't get past here.'\"\n\nBut Itan, who grew up in the area, says he was able to make his way into the cordoned-off area, where he remained until the next morning.\n\nHe says that Tuesday night, local residents began to search the hillside which divides Penha from the nearby Alemão neighbourhood for relatives who had been missing since the police raid.\n\nResidents of the Penha neighbourhood proceeded to place the recovered bodies in a  square - and Itan's photos show the reaction of the people there.\n\n\"The brutality of it all impacted me a lot: the sorrow of the families, mothers fainting, pregnant wives, crying, outraged parents,\" the photographer recalled.\n\nThe governor of Rio state said that the massive police operation involving around 2,500 security personnel was aimed at stopping a criminal group known as Comando Vermelho (Red Command) from expanding its territory.\n\nInitially, the Rio state government maintained that \"60 suspects and four police officers\" had been killed in the operation.\n\nThey have since said that their \"preliminary\" count shows that 117 \"suspects\" have been killed.\n\nRio's public defender's office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, has put the total number of people killed at 132.\n\nAccording to researchers, Red Command is the only criminal group which in recent years has managed to make territorial gains in the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIt is widely considered one of the two largest gangs in the country, alongside First Capital Command (PCC), and has a history dating back more than 50 years.\n\nAccording to Brazilian journalist Rafael Soares, who has been covering crime in Rio for years, Red Command \"operates like a franchise\" with local criminal leaders forming part of the gang and becoming \"business partners\".\n\nThe gang engages primarily in drug trafficking, but also smuggles guns, gold, fuel, alcohol and tobacco.\n\nAccording to the authorities, gang members are well armed and police said that during the raid, they came under attack from explosive-laden drones.\n\nThe governor of Rio state, Cláudio Castro, described Red Command members as \"narcoterrorists\" and called the four police officers killed in the raid \"heroes\".\n\nBut the number of people killed in the operation has come in for criticism with the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights saying it was \"horrified\".\n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, Governor Castro defended the police force.\n\n\"It wasn't our intention to kill anyone. We wanted to arrest them all alive,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the situation had escalated because the suspects had retaliated: \"It was a consequence of the retaliation they carried out and the disproportionate use of force by those criminals.\"\n\nThe governor also said that the bodies displayed by locals in Penha had been \"manipulated\".\n\nIn a post on X, he said that some of them had been stripped of the camouflage clothing he said they had been wearing \"in order to shift blame onto the police\".\n\nFelipe Curi of Rio's civil police force also said that \"camouflage clothing, vests, and weapons\" had been removed from the bodies and showed footage appearing to show a man cutting camouflage clothing off a corpse.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has summoned Governor Castro to a hearing on Monday to explain the police actions \"in detail\".\n\nWith additional reporting by BBC Brasil's Carol Castro in Rio de Janeiro."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74jden8ddxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:29:29.824+00:00","title":"Five ways US government shutdown is hurting - and why it's about to get worse","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US government shutdown, now in its fifth week, is causing deep economic and social harm.

hurting - and why it's about to get worse\n\nThe US government shutdown has entered its fifth week and there is no clear end in sight.\n\nWith Democrats and Republicans deadlocked over passing a spending plan that would reopen federal agencies, millions of Americans are feeling economic pain that could soon grow worse.\n\nThe fiscal fight means millions of Americans may not receive food aid, thousands of troops could have to work without pay, and millions may go without heat.\n\nHere’s how the shutdown has affected everyday people.\n\nMore than 40 million Americans use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) to feed themselves and their families.\n\nWhile that programme had enough funding to survive the first four weeks of the shutdown, the Trump administration has said the money will run out on 1 November.\n\nBy Saturday, Snap benefits, also called food stamps, could lapse for the first time in the programme's history.\n\nSnap is a critical lifeline that keeps families out of poverty, Hannah Garth, a Princeton University professor who studies food insecurity, told the BBC.\n\nGroups that provide food for people in need are already under strain and the loss of Snap will make the situation worse, she added.\n\nOn Thursday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency so the state could “help the three million New Yorkers losing food assistance” because of the shutdown.\n\nPeople enrolled in Snap have been stockpiling food and visiting aid organisations, as they wait for the impasse to lift on Capitol Hill.\n\nHalf the states and the District of Columbia have sued President Donald Trump's administration over the food aid freeze.\n\nThe administration, in turn, has blamed Democrats for the funding running dry and said it will only draw from a Snap contingency fund in an emergency such as a natural disaster.\n\nThe federal government distributes Snap benefits through programmes run by the states.\n\nSome states, such as Virginia, have said they will be able to make up for any lack of funds in November, but others like Massachusetts have said they can't cover the shortfall.\n\nIf the Trump administration does not

pantries, according to the research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimates that 27% of families have $500 (£380) or less in emergency savings.\n\nThe Pentagon says it has accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay  salaries during the shutdown, but that only works out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million active-duty service members expecting to be paid.\n\nThe White House plans to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account, and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios, a political news outlet.\n\nEarlier this month, the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research.\n\nMore than 160 families told the National Military Family Association, an advocacy group, that they have been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.\n\nAround six million Americans use a federal assistance initiative called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap) for help paying utility bills.\n\nThe government usually sends Liheap funds directly to utility companies in mid-November.\n\nThe temperature is already dropping in northern areas, where Americans heat their homes with propane, electric and natural gas.\n\nMany states bar natural gas and electric companies from cutting off service to people who do not pay their bills, but those rules do not apply to propane or heating oil.\n\nExperts say thousands could face deadly conditions unless the government reopens or the government finds another resolution, such as a nationwide moratorium on cutting off heat in the shutdown.\n\nThousands of Americans work for the federal government as civilian employees and many of those folks will miss a paycheque this week.\n\nIt has been a slow burn for many, with the side effects of the shutdown getting worse.\n\nSome civilian employees were able to get a week or two of compensation, while others have not seen a dollar since 1 October.\n\nAmong those going without pay beginning this week are congressional aides on Capitol Hill.\n\nFood banks and food pantries across the US have already said they have seen an increase in the number of federal workers asking for help - particularly in Washington, DC.\n\nIf the shutdown continues until 1 December, some 4.5 million paycheques will be withheld from federal civilian employees, making for about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nFurloughed employees are typically paid after shutdowns end, although Trump has threatened to withhold pay and is currently trying to fire thousands of workers, which is being challenged in court.\n\nThousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week.\n\nBecause they are considered essential workers, they must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown.  Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.\n\nIn turn, thousands of US flyers have faced widespread delays.\n\n“The problems are mounting daily,” Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a press conference this week.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said many of the flight delays in recent days and weeks have been the result of absence by air traffic controllers.\n\nDuffy has warned controllers could be fired if they fail to show up for work."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyprrp1d50o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:25:14.696+00:00","title":"Russian activity increasing around key Ukrainian town, army chief says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian military leadership, under General Oleksandr Syrskyi, reports that Russian infantry is intensifying activity around the strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, massing in urban areas to avoid combat.

as a nondescript car park behind a large council office.\n\nYet hundreds of years ago an unassuming patch of land in Dumbarton was the location for some of Scotland's darkest moments - as locals who had been accused of witchcraft were led there to be executed.\n\nMore than two dozen people in the town were accused and tortured in the belief that they were doing Satan's bidding, as religious fervour swept the area during the 17th Century.\n\nNow campaigners are hoping to spotlight the names of those accused and pay tribute to them with a memorial.\n\nIn 2022 Nicola Sturgeon offered a formal apology to people accused of witchcraft between the 16th and 18th Centuries.\n\nAbout 4,000 Scots, mostly women, were accused of breaking the Witchcraft Act between 1563 and 1736, and the vast majority were executed.\n\nLouise Wilson has been researching the history of witches in Dumbarton, where she believes suspicion of witchcraft was common.\n\nThrough historical records she has already found 32 cases of people accused from 1624 to 1697 - with 22 of those executed.\n\nOf the remaining 10, one fled the region while the fates of the other nine have been lost to history.\n\n\"Port towns had a lot of accused in Scotland,\" explains Louise, the secretary of Remembering The Accused Witches of Scotland.\n\n\"A lot of hustle and bustle leads to more accusations, so as well as Dumbarton it was the same on the coast of Fife and in Ayr. The failing of the crops, or bad trade or a ship having trouble – these would all be blamed on witches.\"\n\nWitch hunts took place in many countries  during that period, but academics have previously said Scotland's execution rate was five times the European average.\n\nFor Louise, the most terrifying aspect of the accusations lies in how easily they could be made, often with little evidence.\n\n\"These were ordinary people doing ordinary jobs, but if you argue with your neighbour you could end up  accused of witchcraft ,\" says Louise.\n\n\"There is a woman called Jonet Boyd, in 1628.  A man called Robert Glen, who was a notary, accused her.\n\n\"He had met her on the street and said she threw words and obscenities at him, grabbed his clock, whipped him around and threw a stone at him. Two witnesses also confirmed this happened.\n\n\"The next morning he accused her of witchcraft – however there is nothing in the records about whether he had done something to her to make her act like that.  Maybe she turned him down – we don't know.\"\n\nJonet Boyd was executed as a result of the accusations from Robert Glen.\n\nNot all the accused were women, though the majority were. Louise recounts a slater called John McWilliam, who fled to Stranraer after being accused of witchcraft for a second time, before going on trial in Edinburgh.\n\nHe was then executed in 1655.\n\nOther signs of witchcraft listed in local records include not attending church and talking to animals, which were assumed to be a witch's familiar - meaning a supernatural creature helping the accused.\n\nIf someone was accused, they would be subject to brutal torture aimed at securing a confession.\n\nHowever methods often associated with witch trials, such throwing them into water with hands tied behind their back, were more common in England rather than Scotland.\n\nScottish alternatives were not any more pleasant, however.\n\n\"Things like  dooking or hanging  weren't done in Scotland – they were strangled and burned instead,\" says Louise.\n\n\"They would be kept awake for three days and three nights, getting beaten told to keep walking while have accusations screamed at them. They also used thumb and finger screws, iron boots and crimp claws.\n\n\"They would be stripped naked and their hair shaved, then brought in front of a judiciary of ministers and highly ranked men in the town.\n\n\"Someone would search for the devil's mark to prove they were in league with Satan - that could be something like a mole or a birthmark.  So by the time they were executed they looked the typical stereotype of a Halloween witch.\"\n\nThose stereotypes might bring to mind images of black hats, broomsticks and cackling over cauldrons,  common in much media .\n\nHowever for the accused, the effect of the accusations - even if later cleared - were immense.\n\nIn Dumbarton the situation was stoked by zealous local ministers,  with the Covenanter movement  having considerable influence at the time.\n\n\"You had ministers saying witches were among us, they are in thrall to Satan and it was being drummed in people that witches were among the community.\n\n\"This lasted for over 150 years but it's not well known about, it's not being taught in history classes.\"\n\nLouise and the rest of the RAWS team are now seeking to place a memorial at the execution site off Church Street in Dumbarton.\n\nThey will also host a conference at Maryhill Burgh Halls on 8 November.\n\nEarlier councillors discussed the matter, and agreed that it was important to remember the victims.\n\nA West Dunbartonshire Council spokesperson said: \"We have been engaging with Remembering the Accused Witches of Scotland who are keen to install a fitting memorial.\"\n\nFor Louise, a display would be important, as would telling the stories of those accused to future generations.\n\n\"When you say their names and tell their stories, it's a way of remembering them.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91jnyelq2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:45:35.818+00:00","title":"Louvre: Five new suspects arrested over jewellery theft","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with a brazen jewellery heist at the Louvre museum in Paris on 19 October 2025, where €88 million worth of French crown jewels were stolen.

theft\n\nFive   more suspects have been arrested over their involvement in the Louvre heist, Paris' public prosecutor has said.\n\nThey were detained on Wednesday night in the Paris region during coordinated raids, according to Laure Beccuau.\n\nOne of the suspects is thought to be part of the four-man team that carried out the heist, who were seen on CCTV.\n\nTwo of the other alleged thieves have already been arrested and have  \"partially recognised\" their involvement  in the brazen theft, while the fourth person has not yet been caught.\n\nIt is not clear what role the other newly arrested people allegedly played in the theft, but Beccuau told French radio station RTL on Thursday that they \"may eventually inform us about how the incident took place\".\n\nBeccuau said the arrests had been made in areas in and around Paris, including the  suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.\n\nPhones and other objects found on the suspects during the raid were allowing investigators to study encrypted messages, she added.\n\nThose arrested can be detained for up to four days before being charged or released.\n\nFrench investigators are not giving many more details away at this stage but Beccuau said that DNA from one of those arrested on Wednesday night could be linked to the crime scene.\n\n\"We had him in our sights,\" she said of the main suspect.\n\nShe specified that the latest arrests were not related to statements made by the previously detained suspects but to \"other elements of the case\".\n\nThe authorities have previously said that the gang involved in the heist could be bigger than those who physically stole the jewels.\n\nItems worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the Louvre - the world's most-visited museum - on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight. The precious jewels have not been recovered yet.\n\nThe first two people who were arrested over the heist - both men in their thirties with criminal records - are thought to be the pair who used power tools to enter the museum's  Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) and steal some of the French crown jewels.\n\nThey were taken into custody late last week. Beccuau told a press conference on Wednesday that one of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but that the other man had not been planning to leave France, contrary to earlier media reports.\n\nThere was no evidence at this stage to suggest the theft was an inside job, she added, confirming no accomplices worked at the museum.\n\nOn the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30, just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Gallery of Apollo via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.\n\nBeccuau said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east. Nobody had been threatened during the raid.\n\nFrance's justice minister said security protocols in the Louvre - one of the world's most famous museums - \"failed\" in preventing the theft.\n\nIt was later revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Gallery of Apollo was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in.\n\nSince the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.\n\nThe Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5q0leq2lpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:37:13.554+00:00","title":"NewJeans: K-pop group loses legal battle against agency","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NewJeans, a rapidly rising K-pop girl group, has lost a legal battle to terminate its contract with record label Ador, with a South Korean court ruling that the contract remains valid until 2029.

NewJeans: K-pop group loses legal battle against agency\n\nK-pop group NewJeans has lost a legal battle to leave its record label Ador.\n\nA South Korean court on Tuesday ruled that the act's contract with the label, which runs until 2029, remains valid.\n\nThe group's five members - Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji - announced last year that they were unilaterally leaving the agency, citing mistreatment and manipulation.\n\nThe group has said it will appeal the ruling, according to local media reports.\n\nNewJeans said it is \"impossible to return to Ador\" and continue their activities as normal, the reports said.\n\nThe Seoul Central Disctrict Court rejected NewJeans' argument that the dismissal of former Ador CEO Min Hee-jin, who was also the group's mentor, constituted a breach of contract. NewJeans alleged that her dismissal broke their trust with the agency.\n\nIn a statement released after the ruling, Ador said it sincerely hopes that the judgment \"will serve as an opportunity for the artists to calmly reflect on this matter\".\n\nThe label added that the it is ready for the members' upcoming activities, including the release of an album, and is now \"waiting\".\n\nThe case stunned South Korea where record labels wield large amounts of power and tightly control their stars. It is highly unusual for artists to rebel against them.\n\nFormed in July 2022, NewJeans, whose members are aged from 17 to 21, had enjoyed rapid success before their dramatic fallout with the agency.\n\nTheir first single Attention topped Korean charts right after their debut, while their hit song SuperShy made multiple \"best of the year\" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.\n\nCritics had called them a \"game-changer\" as their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop scene dominated by electronic beats.\n\nTuesday's ruling follows a year-long standoff between the chart-topping group and its agency.\n\nThe group's announcement to split from Ador, which was made in November last year during a press conference, came after a long and public spat between Min Hee-jin, and Ador, as well as its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.\n\nTensions between Min and Hybe started in April 2024, when Hybe launched audits into Ador, which was then managed by Min, while calling her to step down.\n\nMin rejected Hybe's allegations that she was plotting to go independent. In August, she was dismissed as the CEO of Ador.\n\nThe band soon issued an ultimatum demanding that Min be reinstated. When Hybe refused, the members went public with a series of complaints against the label, including claims it had deliberately undermined their careers.\n\nOne of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.\n\nIn December, Ador filed a lawsuit asking the court to confirm the validity of their contract with the group.\n\nAs the disputes continued, the group's five members attemped to rebrand themselves as NJZ in February. They planned to release a new song, but the promotions were halted by a court order.\n\nThe group still performed it at a show in Hong Kong, where they announced a hiatus.\n\nBack in March, after the court injunction was issued, the group described the court's decision as  \"a shock\" , but said the five of them would \"go through it\" together."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v5xn8gdvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"00:05:14.674+00:00","title":"The dads helping daughters through their periods","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a growing movement among fathers to openly discuss periods with their daughters, challenging traditional gender roles and stigma.

I was only 10,\" she says. \"I went to a school that had no provision, no bins even.\"\n\nHey Girls launched its Pads for Dads campaign in 2019, offering free guidance and resources to help fathers have those early talks.\n\n\"It was designed to break the stigma around periods for dads and parents in general,\" she explains. \"Don't wait for a big conversation, it's about having lots of smaller ones, making sure you've got products in the house and just being supportive.\"\n\nHannah says it's also essential parents talk to their sons about periods to make them aware.\n\nDr Nighat Arif, a GP who specialises in women's health, started talking to her six-year-old son when he found one of her tampons in the bathroom.\n\n\"I said 'This is something that mummy uses because she bleeds'\".  Initially, this made him anxious, but she told him it was normal and happened to all women every month.\n\nHannah says attitudes are changing fast and has even noticed a shift in her own dad who would have once avoided period conversations but now \"if his granddaughters needed something or wanted to have that conversation, I think he'd be much more open\".\n\nConsultant gynaecologist Dr Christine Ekechi, who works in the NHS, says there's often a double standard when it comes to parents talking to their children about puberty.\n\n\"There are so many single mothers with sons and we don't tell them they cannot talk to their sons about puberty and adolescence and about protective sex.\n\n\"So why do we still have this hang up if it's the other way around?\"\n\nAn increase in openness at home also has wider effects and Dr Ekechi believes informed fathers make better colleagues and leaders too.\n\nThis can help reduce period stigma in the workplace and improve menstrual equity at work.\n\nAbove all though, \"it's a fantastic way to improve a bond between a father and a daughter,\" she says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmxevlye9po","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:48:47.706+00:00","title":"Prince William and Catherine win legal battle over ski holiday pictures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Prince and Princess of Wales have successfully taken legal action in France against Paris Match, which published unauthorized photographs and an intrusive article about their private ski holiday in the Alps in April.

D66 party from fifth place to the top of Dutch politics in less than two years has been extraordinary.\n\nBut politically, all the stars were perfectly aligned for the 38-year-old to do so.\n\nThe result of Wednesday's election is too close to call, with Jetten vying with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders for the most seats in parliament.\n\nNo other political leader commanded as much screen time during the campaign as Jetten and his smile and cheerful message resonated with voters, while his rivals sometimes struggled.\n\nHardly a night went by without him on TV. When Wilders cancelled an appearance because of security fears, Rob Jetten seized the moment and took his place. He even featured in a TV quiz show recorded months ago called The Smartest Person.\n\nAnd his D66 party was untarnished by involvement in Wilders' ill-fated 11-month coalition, largely because Jetten had fared so poorly in the last election in 2023. The government collapsed last June when  Wilders' party quit following a row over migration .\n\nBut perhaps more than anything else, he was able to convey a positive message summed up by the slogan  Het kan wel  - an optimistic phrase that borrows from Barack Obama's \"Yes, we can\".\n\nIt contrasted strongly with Wilders, who he accused of \"sowing division\".\n\nIf his party does come top, Rob Jetten could become the Netherlands' first openly gay prime minister.\n\nA self-confessed politics nerd as a child, the young Jetten grew up in a small town in the southern province of Brabant and came out when he was young.\n\nJetten has not made his private life part of his political identity, but five years ago he posted a video in which he read out a long list of homophobic messages from his phone, to prove why an international day against homophobia was important.\n\nJetten is now engaged to Argentine hockey player, Nicolás Keenan, and they are due to marry next year.\n\nHe was an early supporter of the centrist D66, which describes itself as progressive and socially liberal party, and officials soon spotted his potential.\n\nAfter a few years working for Dutch rail network ProRail, Jetten was elected as an MP in 2017 and had a couple of early experiences as leader before he served under long-serving prime minister Mark Rutte as climate minister.\n\nBut not everything has worked out smoothly in Jetten's career.\n\nA parliamentary colleague complained he was \"pushy\" on the climate, and his big ambitions as minister were cut short when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.\n\nHe led D66's disastrous campaign in 2023 when the party came away with only nine seats, two years after his predecessor Sigrid Kaag managed second place after Rutte.\n\nJetten was not yet as fluent in front of the cameras. Some media appearances he gave were criticised as dull, and one critic labelled him \"Robot Jetten\".\n\n\"Robot Jetten is going to be prime minister!\" one reporter said to him incredulously as his success became clear on Wednesday night.\n\n\"Sometimes it can work out really crazy in politics,\" Jetten replied with a broad grin.\n\nSupporters see him as a kind of mini-Mark Rutte, who is now head of Nato.\n\nAnd that comparison will suit Jetten fine, as many Dutch now look back warmly on the stability of the Rutte years, after two years of relative turmoil.\n\nBoth men always appear cheerful and pragmatic, and both are notorious for getting by on precious little sleep.\n\nHowever, party colleague Roy Kramer noticed a difference: \"Rutte is a chatterbox, Jetten is a bit quieter,\" he told Dutch newspaper Het Parool.\n\nThe liberal leader has big ambitions, and few challenges are more pressing than tackling the Netherlands' housing crisis, with a shortage of some 400,000 homes.\n\nJetten wants to build 10 cities and complains Dutch governments have not really achieved anything impressive for the past 10 to 15 years. He is making big promises and will come under pressure to deliver.\n\nFor Jetten to succeed he will need some of Rutte's teflon political coating that saw him through four governments.\n\nHe has already survived one awkward moment in the campaign, when a joke about Crown Princess Amalia fell flat in front of 2,000 students in Rotterdam.\n\n\"I think the best way of promoting work in the military is being able to end up training with the Crown Princess. I bet a few guys in this audience would be interested in that,\" he said.\n\nThe debate moderator hit back saying: \"what kind of sexist remark is that?\"\n\nJetten later admitted it was inappropriate, but it appears to have done him no harm."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drnjkz849o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:45:22.721+00:00","title":"Teacher shot by 6-year-old student testifies against school administrator","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former Virginia schoolteacher, Abigail Zwerner, testified in a civil trial against former assistant principal Ebony Parker, alleging that Parker failed to act on warnings about a 6-year-old student bringing a gun to Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia.

attacks in Lebanon.\n\nThe troops, accompanied by drones and light armoured vehicles, entered Blida and stormed the town hall, where the employee - named as Ibrahim Salameh - was sleeping, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency.\n\nThe Israeli military said its troops were conducting an operation to \"dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure\", without providing evidence that the building was being used by the group.\n\nIsrael's operation drew a furious response in Lebanon, where a ceasefire ended a war between them last November.\n\nIsrael's military says troops encountered a \"suspect\" inside the building and opened fire when an \"immediate threat\" was identified, it added. It was not clear whether Salameh had been the target of the operation.\n\nIsrael has stepped up its attacks on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim group backed by Iran.\n\nThe Lebanese President, Joseph Aoun, instructed the commander of the Lebanese army to confront any Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaf Salam denounced the killing of Salameh and the incursion as a \"flagrant violation of Lebanese institutions and sovereignty\".\n\nHe said Lebanon would continue pressing the United Nations and ceasefire guarantors \"to ensure a halt to the repeated violations and the implementation of a complete Israeli withdrawal from our lands\".\n\nProtests were held on Thursday morning in Blida and nearby towns, where residents blocked roads with burning tyres to denounce what they called a \"blatant aggression\" and the state's failure to protect civilians.\n\nOver recent days, Israel intensified its strikes across Lebanon, saying it was targeting Hezbollah positions.\n\nA second Israeli operation was reported overnight in the nearby village of Adaisseh, where residents say troops blew up a religious ceremonial hall.\n\nIsraeli warplanes also flew over parts of southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley on Thursday, while drones were again seen circling low above Beirut's southern suburbs.\n\nDuring a meeting of ceasefire monitors on Wednesday, US envoy Morgan Ortagus said Washington welcomed Lebanon's \"decision to bring all weapons under state control by the end of the year\", adding that the Lebanese army \"must now fully implement its plan\".\n\nUnder the ceasefire agreement, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to move its fighters north of the Litani river and dismantle its military infrastructure there - a plan the group and its allies strongly oppose.\n\nOnly the Lebanese army and the UN peacekeeping force, Unifil, are authorised to deploy armed personnel in the area south of the Litani, but Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/food-stamps-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:20:33-04:00","title":"Trump Administration Tells Court It Has Money It Can’t Spend to Prevent Food Stamp Cuts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has acknowledged it possesses billions of unused federal funds that could cover the full cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for one month, yet it maintains that legal, technical, and budgetary constraints prevent it from using those funds to avoid cutting benefits for 42 million low-income Americans.

suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety.\n\nThe previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".\n\nIn February, the US president announced the

whistle\".\n\nIn the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".\n\nThe White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.\n\nThe tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.\n\nThe South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.\n\nOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".\n\nThe US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups.\n\nSome have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East.\n\n\"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\"\n\n\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.\n\nThe South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances.\n\nWhile the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024.\n\nOf these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer.

between President Trump and Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, world leaders were hoping for news of an economic truce that could help stabilize the global economy. They got it.\n\nThey got something extra, as well: intensified concerns about whether the world is entering a new era of nuclear weapons proliferation among global powers.\n\nAfter a 90-minute face to face meeting in South Korea, Mr. Trump announced that the two leaders had sharply de-escalated their trade standoff, agreeing, in essence, on a yearlong cease-fire that would roll back tit-for-tat measures including steep tariffs and shutting off access to rare earth metals.\n\nThe meeting was the most anticipated and consequential event of Mr. Trump’s nearly weeklong tour through Asia, where he engaged in a series of trade and security agreements with other countries in the region, many of them geared toward containing Beijing.\n\n“I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington.\n\nThe agreement was a win for the world economy, but was brokered under the shadow of a new and sudden amplification of nuclear threats between global powers.\n\nJust minutes before he landed in Busan, South Korea, to meet with Mr. Xi, Mr. Trump announced on social media that the United States would immediately restart nuclear weapons testing after a lull of more than 30 years. The announcement came after Russia announced that it had also conducted tests of a nuclear-capable missile and sea drone this week.\n\n“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” he wrote, saying the process would begin immediately.\n\nMr. Trump did not provide any further details about the decision. But with his message, Mr. Trump seemed to be ratcheting up pressure as he prepared to meet with the leader with the world’s second- largest economy and third-largest nuclear arsenal.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Xi as a “great leader of a very powerful, very strong country.” And he appeared to soften his hard-edged statement from earlier in the day, suggesting that his announcement was not aimed at China but at other nations that he repeatedly declined to name.\n\n“We have more nuclear weapons than anybody, we don’t do testing,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ve halted it years — many years ago,” he said. “But with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”\n\nBut the chaotic backdrop to the meeting was a reminder of how Mr. Trump’s approach to issues and diplomacy can change on a dime — even on a matter as vital as the strategy governing the American nuclear arsenal — and also displayed his increasingly volatile approach to foreign policy since he retook office.\n\nThe meeting also drove home how much is at stake every time the United States and China meet now: the global economy, security across the world and the sprawling implications of negotiation between the two countries, affecting everything from individual alliances in the Indo Pacific to the outcome of the Russian invasion in Ukraine.\n\nA readout issued by the Chinese official news agency Xinhua after the meeting did not address what agreements were made but did allude to China’s recent move to cut off supplies of critical minerals.\n\nThe statement noted that Mr. Xi told Trump that recent “twists and turns” in the U.S.-China relationship should be a lesson to them both to avoid the “vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.”\n\nThe meeting concluded with clear victories for Mr. Trump’s foreign and domestic agenda.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One that China had agreed to suspend for a year its limits on exports of rare earth metals, which are crucial for a wide range of advanced manufacturing industries. The move by China earlier this month to restrict the exports had prompted Mr. Trump to threaten to cancel this week’s meeting.\n\nHe also said that Mr. Xi had agreed to take stronger action to stop the flow of precursor chemicals for making fentanyl and that the United States in response would reduce to 10 percent, from 20 percent, the fentanyl-linked tariffs it had imposed on China early this year. Reducing fentanyl deaths in the United States has been a priority for Mr. Trump.\n\nIn a social media post, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Xi had also committed to purchasing a “massive amounts of Soybeans” and other agricultural products, adding that “Our Farmers will be very happy!” He wrote that China would also “begin the process” of purchasing American energy.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump greeted Mr. Xi warmly ahead of their talks at a military base in Busan, the mood was more fraught than it had been when he met the leaders of Japan and South Korea earlier this week.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, his five days in Asia beforehand had largely been about gathering honors and securing trade deals quickly. On Thursday, the tour took a sober turn as he encountered Mr. Xi, even as he called him a “friend of mine.”\n\nBefore meeting, the two leaders tensely shook hands in front of a row of Chinese and American flags at an air base in Busan, with Mr. Trump doing the talking and Mr. Xi staying largely silent.\n\n“President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we’re going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Xi, for his part, approached the meeting with caution and steeliness. In his remarks, Mr. Xi likened China-U.S. relations to a “giant ship” that requires steady joint leadership.\n\nMr. Xi also said that he and Mr. Trump “do not always see eye to eye with each other” and said it was “normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.”\n\nHe also suggested that he would not bend to Mr. Trump’s “America First” agenda. “I always believe that China’s development goes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,” Mr. Xi said.\n\nBefore their private meeting, the two leaders said they were focused on the long list of trade negotiations before them, and signaled they would ignore far graver concerns, including the resumption of nuclear testing among hotly competing countries and Mr. Xi’s interest in putting more distance between America and Taiwan.\n\nMr. Xi did not respond to a question about whether he would raise the issue of Taiwan at the meeting. Mr. Trump did not answer a question about why he had ordered nuclear weapons testing to resume for the first time in 33 years. The president paused before declining to answer the question, a rare reaction for an almost always spontaneous leader.\n\nMr. Trump said after the meeting that the issue of Taiwan did not come up during the leaders’ discussion. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he did not expect it to, and he would not say whether or not he supported independence for the self-governed island, which China claims as its own.\n\nThe two leaders discussed partnering to address other conflicts, he said. Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Xi had discussed the war in Ukraine at length and that they were “going to work together to see if we can get something done.”\n\nMr. Trump, who has pressured other nations to stop purchasing Russian oil, which is helping to fund its invasion of Ukraine, noted that Mr. Xi had been buying oil from Russia for a long time but said they did not really discuss the topic.\n\nMr. Trump’s announcement that he would resume nuclear testing came after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that his country had successfully tested a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missile, and then, separately, a nuclear sea drone that could set off a tsunami. And Mr. Xi is overseeing one of the fastest buildups of a nuclear arsenal on Earth.\n\nAsked whether he believed his directive would create a riskier nuclear environment, Mr. Trump brushed off its impact saying, “I think we have it pretty well locked up.”\n\nMr. Trump added that the United States was already in talks with Russia about denuclearization and that “China would be added to that.”\n\nMr. Trump’s announcement also came after he had made substantial announcements about building the defenses of American allies in the region.\n\nAt a naval base near Tokyo on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that the Japanese government had placed an order of American-made missiles to arm their fighter jets. His administration has been pressuring the Japanese to spend more on military defense.\n\nStanding next to him, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi of Japan promised that she had renewed her resolve “to make the Indo-Pacific free and open,” a reference to checking Chinese maneuvers and territorial ambitions in the South China Sea.\n\nIn South Korea, Mr. Trump highlighted the country’s investment in American shipbuilding and said later that he had given the U.S. ally​ “approval ​to build a nuclear powered submarine.”\n\nBy the time he arrived in Busan, Mr. Trump was hoping that he had collected enough leverage for an agreement with Mr. Xi and was looking for more chances to engage.\n\nThroughout his trip, Mr. Trump struck a hopeful tone about striking a deal that could bolster a fragile trade truce that the United States and China struck last month after four rounds of negotiations. As he flew back to Washington, Mr. Trump declared victory.\n\nHe called the meeting “a great success” and announced that he would visit in China in April.\n\n“The whole relationship is very, very important,” he said.\n\nDavid Pierson contributed reporting from Busan, David E. Sanger from Washington, and Lily Kuo from Taipei.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/europe/netherlands-election-parliament-wilders.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:11:48-04:00","title":"‘Not So Bulletproof’: A Far-Right Party Faces Rebuke in the Netherlands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the Netherlands’ recent national elections, voters rejected Geert Wilders’s far-right Party for Freedom, which had previously gained power in 2023, and unexpectedly supported the center-left Democrats 66 (D66).

Both sides also agreed to extend a truce struck earlier this year to limit tariffs.\n\n“What’s clear is they have become increasingly bold in exerting leverage and they are happy to pocket any and all U.S. concessions,” said Julian Gewirtz, who was a senior China policy official at the White House and the State Department in President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration.\n\nSounding almost like he was delivering a lecture, Mr. Xi said to Mr. Trump that the “recent twists and turns” of the trade war should be instructive to them both, according to a Chinese government summary of Mr. Xi’s remarks at the meeting in Busan, South Korea.\n\n“Both sides should consider the bigger picture and focus on the long-term benefits of cooperation, rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” Mr. Xi said.\n\nBy twists and turns Mr. Xi was likely referring to the last several months, or nearly a year, of tit-for-tat retaliatory measures in the form of tariffs, sanctions and export controls. Earlier this month, China escalated dramatically, strengthening its hand by announcing sweeping new limits on the sales of on rare earths, critical minerals that are needed for almost all modern technology. Cutting off their supply could cripple U.S. industries.\n\nMr. Xi’s message seemed to be: Beijing had proven its capacity to hit back and Washington would do well to remember it.\n\n“After Trump launched his trade and tariff war, China was the only country that matched the United States blow for blow,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University, noting that the biggest win for China could be that the United States might think twice before imposing new measures on China.\n\n“If Trump had forced China to implement its complete export controls on rare earths, it would have been a lose-lose situation for both sides,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Xi also seemed to grasp what Mr. Trump needed, a deal that he could sell as a victory at home. The outcome allowed Mr. Trump to claim a win for American farmers and companies, even though China had largely restored the status quo by agreeing to buy soybeans and to hold off on further restricting the export of rare earths.\n\nMr. Trump pumped a fist in the air as he boarded Air Force One, then said on the plane that Mr. Xi had agreed to take more action to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl from reaching the United States. He also said that China promised to purchase more U.S. soybeans. “Our Farmers will be very happy!” he posted on Truth Social afterward. “I would like to thank President Xi for this!”\n\nAfter the two leaders met, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that it would suspend for one year the restrictions on rare earths that were announced in October. (The ministry made no mention of earlier controls announced in April.)\n\nSeparately, Mr. Trump said he would cut in half the 20 percent tariffs he had imposed on Chinese goods to pressure China to do more to stop fentanyl trafficking. The reduction announced on Thursday brings overall tariffs on Chinese goods to around 47 percent from 57 percent, he said. The Chinese commerce ministry also said the two sides had agreed to a one-year extension of a truce to limit additional tariffs that was originally set to expire on Nov. 10.\n\nSome experts said China inevitably had the upper hand in the trade fight because the Trump administration never had a clear objective.\n\n“I think its an approach that can safely be described as tactics without a strategy,” said Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously analyzed Chinese politics at the C.I.A.\n\n“Ostensibly, the goal was to address some of the meaty trade issues that had long bedeviled the relationship. Instead, the P.R.C. side has successfully orchestrated a game of ‘whack-a-mole’ for the Trump Administration,” Mr. Czin said, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China.\n\nStill, in a potential concession by Beijing, China’s official summary of the meeting did not mention Taiwan, the island democracy that Beijing claims. It is a topic that Chinese leaders usually bring up when meeting their U.S. counterparts to pressure Washington to dial back U.S. support for the island.\n\nThe agreements struck on Thursday could mean at least a temporary calm in the fractious U.S.-China relationship. Mr. Trump said the two leaders also discussed “working together” to end the war in Ukraine. He said he would travel to China in April and Mr. Xi would visit the United States after that.\n\nMr. Xi also played to Mr. Trump’s preference for personal rapport by appealing to Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda, saying that he believed China’s development “goes hand in hand” with the president’s “vision to ‘make America great again.’” Mr. Trump, for his part, flattered Mr. Xi, calling him “a great leader of a great country” and a “great friend.”\n\n“It’s a personalized style of diplomacy that plays well to both leaders’ instincts,” said Lizzi C. Lee, a fellow focusing on the Chinese economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “For now, these gestures of good will seem to set the tone for a period of managed stability.”\n\nStill, any progress made on Thursday could easily be erased by moves on either side that are interpreted as violating the agreement. A deal struck last month was almost undone when the U.S. expanded the range of companies banned from accessing U.S. technology, which would have affected many Chinese companies. China then announced its export controls on rare earths. That prompted Mr. Trump to threaten to call off Thursday’s meeting and to impose yet more tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nIn the absence of a finalized agreement, it is unclear how long the current détente will last.\n\n“Maybe I’m jaded because I’ve seen this movie too many times, but these are issues that are relatively easy to roll back and also to accuse the other side of bad faith,” said Ja Ian Chong, a professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, about the state of the truce.\n\nThursday’s progress threatened to be overshadowed by an announcement that Mr. Trump made just before the meeting. He said that the United States would resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in more than three decades. But Mr. Trump seemed to suggest on Air Force One that the move was not directed at China, and analysts said it was not clear that Mr. Xi would see it as a provocation.\n\nMore important, experts in China said, is that the American president is focused on working with China.\n\n“If Trump truly wants to implement something, if he wants to go east, his staff wouldn’t dare go west,” said Xin Qiang, a U.S.-China expert at Fudan University in Shanghai.\n\nPei-Lin Wu contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20pezegv1zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:27:17.972+00:00","title":"Sudan war: Reports of mass killings in el-Fasher in Darfur have echoes of country's dark past","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Reports of mass killings in el-Fasher, Sudan, have prompted human rights and aid organizations to describe the ongoing conflict between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese military as a 'continuation of the Darfur genocide.'

systematic killings in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher have prompted human rights and aid activists to describe the civil war between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the military as a \"continuation of the Darfur genocide\".\n\nThe fall of el-Fasher, in the Darfur region, after an 18-month RSF siege brings together the different layers of the country's conflict – with echoes of its dark past and the brutality of its present-day war.\n\nThe RSF emerged from the Janjaweed, Arab militias who massacred hundreds of thousands of Darfuris from non-Arab populations, in the early 2000s.\n\nThe paramilitary force has been accused of ethnic killings since its power struggle with the army erupted into violence in April 2023. The RSF leadership has consistently denied the accusations - although on Wednesday its leader  Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\"  in el-Fasher.\n\nThe current charges are based on apparent evidence of atrocities provided by the RSF fighters themselves.\n\nThey have been sharing gruesome videos reportedly showing summary executions of mostly male civilians and ex-combatants, celebrating over dead bodies, and taunting and abusing people.\n\nAccounts from exhausted survivors also paint a picture of terror and violence.\n\n\"The situation in el-Fasher is extremely dire and there are violations taking place on the roads, including looting and shooting, with no distinction made between young or old,\" one man told the BBC Arabic service. He had escaped to the town of Tawila, a hub for those displaced from el-Fasher.\n\nAnother woman, Ikram Abdelhameed, told the Reuters news agency that RSF soldiers separated fleeing civilians at an earthen barrier around the city and shot the men.\n\nAnd  satellite images collected by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab  show evidence of what seem to be massacre sites – clusters of bodies and reddish patches on the earth that the analysts believe could be blood stains.\n\nEl-Fasher \"appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of… indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution\", the Yale researchers say in a report.\n\nThere is a clear ethnic element to the battle for el-Fasher, because local armed groups from the dominant Zaghawa tribe, known as the Joint Force, have been fighting alongside the army.\n\nThe RSF fighters see Zaghawa civilians as legitimate targets.\n\nThat is what many survivors of the paramilitary takeover of the Zamzam displaced persons camp next to el-Fasher reported earlier this year, according to an investigation by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF).\n\nThe army has also been accused of targeting ethnic groups it sees as support bases for the RSF in areas it has recaptured, including the states of Sennar, Gezira and some parts of North Kordofan.\n\n\"Whether you're a civilian, wherever you are, it is not safe right now, even in Khartoum,\" says Emi Mahmoud, strategic director of the IDP Humanitarian Network which helps coordinate aid deliveries in Darfur.\n\n\"Because at the flip of a hat, the people in power who have the guns, they can and will continue to falsely imprison, disappear, kill, torture, everyone.\"\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes - ethnically motivated revenge attacks are part of that.\n\nIt was Sudan's military government in 2003 that weaponised ethnicity – enlisting the Janjaweed to put down rebellions by black African groups in Darfur who accused Khartoum of politically and economically marginalising them.\n\nThe pattern of violence established then has been repeated in Darfur now, says Kate Ferguson, the co-founder of NGO Protection Approaches.\n\nThis was most evident in the 2023 massacre of members of the Masalit tribe in el-Geneina in West Darfur, which the UN says killed up to 15,000 people.\n\n\"For more than two years, the RSF have followed a very clear, practiced and predicted pattern,\" Ms Ferguson said at a press briefing.\n\n\"They first encircle their target town or city, they weaken it by cutting off access to food, to medicine, to power supplies, the internet. Then when it's weakened, they overwhelm the population with systematic arson, sexual violence, massacre and the destruction of vital infrastructure. This is a deliberate strategy to destroy and displace, and that's why I feel the appropriate word is genocide.\"\n\nThe RSF has denied involvement in what it has called \"tribal conflicts\", but Gen Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, appeared to be hearing expressions of mounting international outrage, including from the UN, the African Union, the European Union and the UK.\n\nHe released a video saying he was sorry for the disaster that had befallen the people of el-Fasher in a war that had been \"forced upon us\" and admitted there had been violations by his forces, promising they would be investigated by a committee that has now arrived in the city.\n\nAny \"soldier or any officer who committed a crime or crossed the lines against any person… will be immediately arrested and the result [of the investigation] to be announced immediately and in public in front of everyone,\" the general pledged.\n\nHowever, observers say similar promises made in the past - in response to accusations of a massacre in the Darfui city of el-Geneina in 2023, and alleged atrocities during the group's control of the central state of Gezira - were not fulfilled.\n\nIt is also not clear how much control the RSF leadership has over its foot soldiers – a loose mix of hired militias, allied Arab groups, and regional mercenaries, many from Chad and South Sudan.\n\n\"The reality is that the way that the RSF is, it's very, very hard to believe that a command is going to be given by Hemedti, and then people on the ground are going to follow it,\" says aid co-ordinator Ms Mahmoud. \"By that time, we'll have lost many, many people.\"\n\nAid groups and activists warn that if the pattern of the past two years is allowed to continue, it could happen again. They stress that the el-Fasher killings were entirely predictable, but the international community failed to act to protect civilians despite ample warning.\n\n\"The reality is that we laid these options out multiple times over six meetings with UN Security Council elements, with the US government, with the British government, with the French government, basically saying they had to be ready for a protection kinetic option [direct military action] in the summer of last year,\" says Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab.\n\n\"This cannot be something settled by a press conference. It has to be something settled by immediate action.\"\n\nIn particular, activists are urging pressure on the United Arab Emirates, which is widely accused of providing military support to the RSF. The UAE denies this despite evidence presented in UN reports and international media investigations.\n\n\"This is exactly like the siege of Sarajevo,\" says Ms Mahmoud, referring to the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnia war, which galvanised international action. \"This is the Srebrenica moment.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/30/upshot/obamacare-subsidies-new-prices.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:26:58-04:00","title":"Here’s How Much Obamacare Prices Are Rising Across the Country","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that health insurance premiums under Obamacare are set to rise significantly in 2026 if federal subsidies—extended in 2021 and 2022—are allowed to expire.

health insurance plans became public this week, with big increases in premiums across the country. We now have data that shows how much more people will pay.\n\nMost people who buy their own coverage don’t pay full price. Tax credits created by the Affordable Care Act help pay the bills. But the new prices reflect what will happen if extra tax subsidies, first passed in 2021 and extended in 2022, are allowed to expire at the end of this year.\n\nFigures are for the median county. Source: KFF estimates\n\nExtending the subsidies would cost the federal government around $23 billion next year and about $350 billion over the next decade, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. Without them, many Americans will face much higher costs before the midterm elections next fall — in some cases increases of more than a thousand dollars per month.\n\nThe magnitude of the change depends on where people live, how old they are, and what they earn. (More details below.)\n\nThis funding is at the heart of the congressional fight that has left the government shut down for nearly a month. Democrats have demanded an extension as a condition of their support for a government funding bill. Republicans have said they won’t consider an extension until the government is reopened.\n\nThe numbers in our charts and maps come from researchers at the health research group KFF, and reflect insurance prices published on healthcare.gov and state websites that allow people to “window shop” before Saturday, when insurance marketplaces will open for business. An earlier version of this article included estimated premiums for insurance next year, but now we can show the real prices Americans are currently facing.\n\nCongress could still act and change the funding structure, but probably not before people start picking health plans this week.\n\nFor people earning the lowest incomes, the expiration of the subsidies will mean the end of free, generous insurance. Right now, with the extra subsidies, eligible Americans who earn less than $24,000 a year don’t have to contribute money toward their premiums, though they still face some co-payments and deductibles when they use their insurance.\n\nA single person earning $22,000, for example, will have to pay $66 a month for a typical plan after the subsidies expire.\n\nAround half of all enrollees in Affordable Care Act marketplaces nationwide will experience increases in this range — from a free premium to one between $27 and $82 a month. This group includes many people close to the poverty line in states that didn’t expand their Medicaid program. Their insurance will remain heavily subsidized, just at the lower level established by the original Affordable Care Act legislation.\n\nAlthough the price difference in dollars may look small, it can mean a lot for people who earn less than $2,000 a month. Since the enhanced subsidies became law, sign-ups in this lowest income group have tripled, with particularly large increases in Texas, Florida and Georgia. Some critics of the subsidies say the numbers have gotten so high that they are concerned about fraud.\n\nPeople who earn a little more — $35,000 a year —are also facing relatively standard price increases around the country. Their cost for a typical plan will more than double without the extra subsidies, from $86 a month to $218 for a popular plan.\n\nAround 40 percent of enrollees earn between $24,000 and $63,000 and will experience increases of this type.\n\nMany older people at this income level will experience a sharp increase in premiums — from a few hundred dollars a month to $1,000 or more.\n\nIn most states, the enhanced subsidies created a ceiling on how much people earning more than $63,000 have to pay. Without the extra subsidies, people will have to pay whatever insurers in their markets charge. People in this group tend to be self-employed or work for small businesses.\n\nBecause insurers are allowed to charge higher prices to older customers than younger ones, subsidies for Americans at this income level make the biggest difference for people close to retirement age. The large increases in the underlying insurance premiums — around 26 percent on average for a typical plan — pile on top of the lost subsidies.\n\nEstimates are for the median county. Figures are rounded. Source: KFF estimates\n\nBut where people live also matters. Premiums tend to be higher in rural areas, and they are particularly high in a handful of very rural states, like Wyoming and West Virginia.\n\nFor some people in the most expensive markets, the increases could be staggering. A 60-year-old living in southern Illinois will face premiums increasing from $460 a month with the subsidies to $2,800 a month without.\n\nFewer than 10 percent of all Obamacare customers earn $65,000 or more.\n\nPeople with even higher incomes have to pay a lot for Obamacare health insurance, with or without the extra subsidies.\n\nEstimates are for the median county. Source: KFF estimates\n\nMany younger people who earn this much haven’t seen any benefit from the extra subsidies. The subsidies kick in only when the cost of insurance is more than 8.5 percent of their income, which comes up only in the most expensive markets.\n\nBut some older people with high incomes do save money with the extra subsidies. Without them, they will pay even more than they already do.\n\nThis group is also affected by rising premiums. Even though the subsidies didn’t help many of them this year, they still paid lower premiums than insurers are offering in most markets for next year.\n\nOur charts and maps focus on how subsidies affect individuals buying insurance. The math is a bit more complicated for people who are buying insurance for their whole family. But the basic patterns are similar: Families at lower incomes would face more uniform increases, while families at higher incomes would see variable price increases, depending on where they live and the age of each family member.\n\nYou can estimate your personal household costs with and without the subsidies using this calculator from KFF.\n\nThe numbers in our analysis come from researchers at the health research group KFF and are calculated using insurance premiums published on healthcare.gov and state insurance marketplaces as part of “window shopping” for the 2026 plan year. An earlier version of this article was published using estimated price increases for 2026, and showed similar though not identical numbers.\n\nConsumer costs are calculated based on the price of the “benchmark” silver plan in each market, the second-least expensive plan that covers around 70 percent of the average enrollee’s medical costs. Individual consumers may pay more or less if they choose other plans in the market. Calculations account only for federal tax credits and do not include additional state subsidies, available for some consumers in several states.\n\nIn a handful of states, people earning $22,000 won't be immediately affected by subsidy changes because they qualify for different low-cost state insurance programs: Medicaid in Alaska, Hawaii and the District of Columbia; and the basic health plan in Minnesota, Oregon and New York (the basic health plan is Medicaid-like coverage with low premiums for a sliver of low-income Americans in certain states). New York residents earning $35,000 also currently qualify for the basic health plan.\n\nThe federal poverty level is higher in Alaska and Hawaii than in other states, which means the top income cutoff for subsidies in those states is higher than $63,000. That difference explains small differences in the average prices for people at $65,000 and $95,000 in income.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/republicans-hispanics-new-jersey.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:03:05-04:00","title":"What New Jersey Could Reveal About the Future of the Hispanic Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 New Jersey governor’s race is being viewed as a critical barometer for the future of the Hispanic vote in U.S. politics.

About the Future of the Hispanic Vote\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T05:03:05-04:00\n\nMoments after Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, bounded down the steps of his campaign bus on the first day of early voting, he began to rattle off statistics about the size and strength of the state’s Latino population.\n\n“We have more than two million people that are of Hispanic descent and more than 500,000 that are Puerto Rican,” Mr. Ciattarelli said, flanked by the Republican governor of Puerto Rico who had flown in to campaign with him. “And we’re so very happy that they called New Jersey home.”\n\nLatino voters are not only a critical swing bloc in this year’s New Jersey governor’s race but also an important test nationally of just how enduring the gains that President Trump made last year in the Hispanic community will prove.\n\nMr. Trump lost New Jersey by less than six percentage points in 2024, a surprisingly close result that came largely because of his remarkable strength in the state’s most diverse areas. Every single one of New Jersey’s 29 townships with a majority Hispanic population swung in Mr. Trump’s direction between 2020 and 2024 — by an average of 25 percentage points.\n\nA handful of once reliably Democratic areas flipped to the G.O.P., including Clifton, a township that is roughly 40 percent Hispanic and where Mr. Ciattarelli’s bus stopped on Saturday.\n\nChange in presidential margin from 2020 to 2024\n\nTrump’s biggest\n\ngains were in\n\nmajority-Hispanic towns in the northeast.\n\nMajority-nonwhite\n\nAtlantic City\n\nTrump’s biggest gains were in\n\nmajority-Hispanic towns in the\n\nMajority-nonwhite townships\n\nAtlantic City\n\nNote: Includes townships where more than 500 votes were cast in 2024.\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nNow the question looming over 2025 is whether the historic movement to the right among Hispanics was evidence of a durable political and racial realignment or a passing phenomenon specific to Mr. Trump — and whether any other Republican besides Mr. Trump can lure Latino voters into the Republican fold.\n\n“New Jersey ends up being the first meaningful temperature check since the last election,” said Carlos Odio, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying Latino voting patterns and lives in New Jersey.\n\nMr. Odio said the answer would be especially significant because Latino voters will hold significant sway in determining control of the House of Representatives in 2026. His firm’s data shows the Hispanic share of the population in the 40 most competitive House seats is 18 percent — compared with 13 percent nationwide. And 12 of the most competitive seats have at least a 20 percent Latino population, though the figure would shift somewhat if California voters approve remapping the state.\n\nIn New Jersey, the fact that both Mr. Ciattarelli and Representative Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee, have invested significantly in outreach to Latino voters has only heightened the significance of the outcome.\n\nMs. Sherrill and her super PAC allies have spent roughly $4 million on Spanish-language advertising and campaigned aggressively in Hispanic communities. Mr. Ciattarelli participated in a recent Spanish-language town hall sponsored by Univision and was recently endorsed by a coalition of more than 100 Latino pastors and ministers. He has made it a mission to march in practically every Hispanic cultural parade in the state.\n\nOne of Mr. Ciattarelli’s challenges will be trying to match Mr. Trump’s 2024 gains in diverse corners of the state without ceding his own past relative strength in 2021 in whiter and more educated towns.\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nIt is unclear whether voters in majority-Hispanic areas will show the same enthusiasm for Mr. Ciattarelli as they did for Mr. Trump in 2024.\n\nThe density of Latino voters in some New Jersey municipalities makes it a uniquely appealing place for political strategists to measure movement in the community. For instance, Union City, just across the Hudson River from New York, is more than 80 percent Hispanic; the township swung 27 percentage points toward the Republican Party in the last presidential election.\n\n“The results will be considered a bellwether,” said Katharine Pichardo, the president of Latino Victory Fund, which seeks to elect Latino Democrats. “What Democrats hope to see is significant erosion of the gains that Trump was able to make with Latinos last year.”\n\nStill, Republicans are bullish that Mr. Ciattarelli can hold onto Mr. Trump’s gains.\n\n“The Latinos are the second wave, like the Irish and Italians who came over in the 1930s: blue-collar American working people to make a better life for themselves,” said Peter Murphy, who owns an Irish bar and is the chairman of the Passaic County Republican Party, which flipped for Mr. Trump in 2024. “Now the Irish and the Italians are a major backbone of the Republican Party. I believe the Latinos now are the backbone of the Republican Party also.”\n\nPassaic County, which is New Jersey’s most Hispanic, is one of more than 1,400 counties nationwide that trended toward the Republican Party not just in 2024 but in three consecutive elections since 2016. Last year, Mr. Trump carried the congressional district that Representative Nellie Pou, a Democrat, won, making her one of 13 House Democrats to survive in a Trump-won district and a potential Republican target next year.\n\nMr. Trump improved Republican performance not just in Latino areas but also in heavily Black and Asian areas. Across all of the state’s majority-nonwhite townships, Mr. Trump cut his margin of defeat to 27 points from 43 points in 2020, amounting to a 16-point rightward shift.\n\nIn other words, Democrats were still winning those areas but by far less.\n\nStill, there are already some signs of softening support for Mr. Trump among Hispanic voters. An October Associated Press-NORC poll showed that the share of Hispanic adults who have a favorable view of Mr. Trump has dropped since he took office in January.\n\n“His gains are not permanent,” Patricia Campos-Medina, a leading Latino activist in the state and the vice chair of the Sherrill campaign. “Can we fix the backsliding of the last 10 years, just in these six months in these three months of spending? I do not think so. But we’re going to move back the needle toward a better outcome for Democrats with Latino voters.”\n\nFor now, Ms. Sherrill, who holds a narrow lead in the polls, currently has an edge of 30 points among nonwhite voters, according to polling from the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nOne of the central questions for strategists of both parties is what issues would drive any potential drift back toward the Democratic Party.\n\nHispanic Americans consistently show among the highest levels of economic stress. In the same A.P. survey, 65 percent of Hispanic adults said the cost of groceries was a strain, compared with 54 percent of U.S. adults overall.\n\nMs. Campos-Medina said Mr. Trump’s failure to address the cost of living had made him vulnerable — more so than his administration’s attention-grabbing immigration enforcement.\n\n“They are not concerned on immigration raids,” she said of Hispanic voters. “They care about it because they see them. But that’s not what drives them to the polls. What drives them to the polls is: Do I have affordable housing? Do my schools — are they teaching my kids what they need to learn? Do I have access to health care? Where am I going to get my new job?”\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Ciattarelli had held Mr. Trump at arm’s length — and outperformed him among whiter and wealthier areas that have trended more Democratic in recent years.\n\nThis year, Mr. Ciattarelli has secured the president’s endorsement and avoided virtually any criticism, giving the president an ‘A’ grade when asked, adding that the president “has been right about everything that he’s doing.”\n\nThe election will test whether Mr. Ciattarelli’s balancing act allows him to mimic Mr. Trump’s strengths in diverse areas without losing ground in more white communities.\n\nCiattarelli did better than Trump in whiter, more college-educated areas\n\nTrump did better than Ciattarelli in more diverse metro areas\n\nAtlantic City\n\nCiattarelli did better\n\nthan Trump in whiter, more college-educated areas\n\nTrump did better than Ciattarelli in more diverse metro areas\n\nAtlantic City\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nTurnout is another X-factor.\n\nTurnout typically drops off substantially in the governor’s race compared with the presidential election the year before, and the drop-off is often steepest in diverse urban areas.\n\nThat is one reason the 2021 governor’s race was so much closer than the 2020 presidential election. Even as Mr. Murphy won majority-Hispanic communities by 48 points, a similar margin to that of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in New Jersey in 2020, those areas saw much bigger drops in turnout than the rest of the state.\n\nIn other words, Ms. Sherrill doesn’t just want to win a greater share of Hispanic voters but also to coax the community to the polls in greater numbers.\n\nEach circle is a township in New Jersey, sized by the number of votes cast in 2021\n\nNote: Includes townships where more than 500 votes were cast in 2021.\n\nSources: New Jersey Division of Elections, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nIn Union City, Mr. Trump in 2024 won more than four times as many votes as Mr. Ciattarelli did in 2021, even as former Vice President Kamala Harris had won virtually the same number of votes as Mr. Murphy did in 2021.\n\n“This is going to give us a great indicator of how 2026 can go,” said Laura Matos, a Democratic strategist working with a pro-Sherrill super PAC and a Democratic National Committee member in New Jersey, “It will be a road map of the work we need to continue to do.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/europe/louvre-heist-arrests-paris.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:08:04-04:00","title":"French Police Arrest 5 More in Louvre Robbery Investigation","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"French police have arrested five additional suspects in connection with a spectacular jewel theft at the Louvre Museum, including one believed to have participated in the break-in.

Pete Hegseth.\n\nSince Sept. 2, the U.S. military has been attacking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs, killing dozens of people. A broad range of legal specialists on the use of lethal force have said that the strikes are illegal extrajudicial killings because the military is not permitted to deliberately target civilians — even suspected criminals — who do not pose an imminent threat of violence.\n\nThis is a drastic departure from past practice. The Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, has typically treated maritime drug smuggling in the Caribbean as a law enforcement problem, interdicting boats and arresting people for prosecution if suspicions of illicit cargo turn out to be correct.\n\nThe White House has said the killings are lawful. It cited a notice to Congress in which the administration said President Trump “determined” that the United States is in a formal armed conflict with drug cartels and that crews of drug-running boats are “combatants.” It has not supplied a legal theory to bridge the conceptual gulf between drug trafficking and an armed attack.\n\nThe New York Times is tracking the boat strikes as details become available. The strike locations and casualty figures are drawn from postings by Mr. Trump or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and have not been independently confirmed by The Times.\n\nThis was the sixth strike in the Pacific in eight days.\n\nThis was one of three strikes on four boats in one day in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Mr. Hegseth said that Mexican search and rescue authorities had “accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue,” but he did not release further details.\n\n*Officials did not specify which of the four destroyed boats the survivor was on in the strikes of Oct. 27.\n\nThis was the second strike in the same day in eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis was the third strike in the same day in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis attack, in the Caribbean Sea, was the first at night, Mr. Hegseth said.\n\nThis was the second strike in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis was the first strike in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nMr. Hegseth described those on the boat as affiliated with Ejército de Liberación Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group. The strike took place in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThis strike was on a semisubmersible in the Caribbean Sea. Two men from the boat were rescued by the U.S. military and repatriated within days to Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nThis strike took place “just off the Coast of Venezuela,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nColombia’s president said this boat was carrying Colombian citizens.\n\nOfficials from the Dominican Republic said they recovered cocaine from the wreckage after this strike.\n\nColombia’s president said the strike occurred near his country and killed an innocent fisherman.\n\nThe first strike on a boat alleged to be carrying drugs was near Trinidad in the Caribbean Sea. The boat appeared to have turned around before being struck.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/climate/candy-chocolate-cocoa-prices-climate-change.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:57:22-04:00","title":"Why Did My Favorite Candy Bar Drop ‘Milk Chocolate’ From the Label?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Candy companies like Hershey and Nestlé have quietly removed 'milk chocolate' from labels on popular bars such as Almond Joy, Mr. Goodbar, and Rolo due to soaring cocoa prices caused by climate change in West Africa.

Drop ‘Milk Chocolate’ From the Label?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T06:57:22-04:00\n\nAlmost no one noticed when, sometime over the last few years, the packaging on Almond Joy, Mr. Goodbar and Rolo was updated to remove the words “milk chocolate.”\n\nThe edits were easy to miss: The description on the front of the Mr. Goodbar wrapper changed from “milk chocolate with peanuts” to “chocolate candy with peanuts.” Almond Joy is now marketed as a “coconut and almond chocolate candy bar.” Rolos are now wrapped in “rich chocolate candy” instead of “milk chocolate.”\n\nI realized this earlier this year after eating a disappointing chocolate bar. It wasn’t spoiled, it just didn’t taste like I remembered. As a reporter who covers the climate, I’d read about global warming contributing to drought in West Africa and sending cocoa prices through the roof, and I knew candy companies had raised prices and shrunk portions.\n\nBut could it be that they were also tinkering with the makeup of the candy itself?\n\nYes, it turns out. Experts say high cocoa prices have triggered a wave of “reformulations,” the industry term for recipe changes. As the Halloween season boosts demand, some candy companies are replacing expensive cocoa butter with other fats, a swap that means their products no longer meet the U.S. regulatory definition of milk chocolate and can no longer be called that on packaging.\n\nThat’s why milk chocolate (a Food and Drug Administration-regulated term) has become chocolate candy. And these are just the most extreme examples. Armed with the latest confectionary techniques, candy scientists work hard to find reformulations that slip below the threshold for a mandatory label change. These might go undetected outside the industry and the tight-knit world of super-taster candy scientists.\n\nSquint a little, and this is a success story: As shifting weather patterns make some ingredients more scarce, the food industry has deployed its multimillion-dollar research and development budget to adjust to major shifts in agriculture.With little notice, evidence of the world’s changing climate has already sneaked into our sweets.\n\nIn recent years, longer droughts, extreme heat and irregular rainfall patterns have suppressed cocoa yields in West Africa, the crop’s primary growing region. An infection carried by mealybugs has also spread rapidly. Financial speculators, the threat of tariffs, labor issues and other geopolitical factors have compounded the problems.\n\nIn February, the nonprofit research group Climate Central published a study that found climate change had brought six additional weeks of extreme heat to most West African growing regions per year over the last decade, suppressing crop productivity.\n\nThe result of all the recent upheaval in the cocoa market is that prices have shot upward, reaching a peak of more than $10,000 per ton at the end of last year, roughly four times the price in 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\n“When climate change bumps into structural problems and disease,” said Judy Ganes, a food industry consultant, “then prices go up and manufacturers are hesitant to pass through price increases and hurt their sales. Either consumers find something else or they try to reformulate.”\n\nFood industry executives have openly acknowledged the trend of cutting down on cocoa ingredients to save money, but when it comes to answering questions about changes in their own recipes, they’re far more circumspect.\n\nAsked about reformulations in a February earnings call, Steve Voskuil, Hershey’s chief financial officer said “it’s a place we look at, we test, and in some parts of our portfolio, over time we’ve made some changes,” and added that “there’s been no consumer impact whatsoever.”\n\nThe same month, Nestlé told investors it had saved more than $500 million through recipe reformulations as it shared a slide showing high cocoa and coffee prices. When I asked Nestlé for more detail, a spokesperson said candy made up a small portion of the cost savings and that much of it came from addressing “recipe complexity” and “harmonizing recipes” from different brands.\n\nSo how can you tell when your favorite candy changes? I compared current labels on the packages of Mr. Goodbar, Rolo caramels, and Almond Joy with past ingredient lists using the crowdsourced database Open Food Facts, a U.S. Department of Agriculture ingredient database, and data compiled by Richard Hartel, a food science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who each year writes down ingredients in common chocolate bars for one of his classes.\n\n(My process also involved a few trips to the grocery store, where I spent an inordinate amount of time squinting at the small print on Halloween candy variety packs.)\n\nAccording to the databases, Rolo and Mr. Goodbar have changed since 2023, and Almond Joy seems to have changed sometime between 2020 and 2022. The Hershey Company, which makes all three candies, declined to comment. (Mr. Goodbar was also not technically milk chocolate for a handful of years starting in 2008, before it apparently switched back.)\n\nBut comparing labels can only tell enterprising candy lovers so much. Food scientists say they’re trained to tweak recipes in a manner that evades consumer detection.\n\nMichelle Frame, founder of the candy development company Victus Ars, was the first person to develop flavored Peeps, an achievement that helped land her in the Candy Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the last year or so, Ms. Frame has noticed changes creeping into her life outside the laboratory. The milk chocolate coating on a Snickers bar she bought seemed thinner than it used to be. She stopped buying a favorite store-bought chocolate chip cookie after she noticed large chocolate chips had been replaced with a lower-quality substitute. (A Mars spokeswoman said Snickers coatings have not changed since 2019, when the candy’s coatings were reduced by a small amount.)\n\nMs. Frame said a common approach to reducing cocoa costs was to replace chocolate coating with compound coating, which is made with vegetable fats instead of cocoa butter. Some candy bars, like Butterfinger and Baby Ruth, have been made with compound coatings for years. Others, like Almond Joy, have changed more recently.\n\nFor candies without coatings, reformulation can be tricker. Candy makers have begun experimenting with realistic substitutes for cocoa butter. Dr. Hartel called this problem “a food scientist’s delight” because replicating cocoa butter’s precise texture and mouth feel is so complicated. It’s also a big business.\n\nOne of the most obvious substitution tells, he added, is the use of the word “chocolatey” on packaging.\n\nCargill, which sells ingredients to other companies, has noted an uptick in interest in chocolate alternatives, said John Satumba, the company’s director of global edible oil solutions research and development. Cargill has invested  $35 million in a facility in the Netherlands that makes coatings and fillings using less cocoa, and is building a facility in Ohio to manufacture chocolate substitutes.\n\nGlobally, the company has invested $70 million in “cocoa butter equivalent capabilities.”\n\nAnother method is to replace chocolate with existing ingredients like sugar or chunky add-ins. Andrew Moriarty, senior cocoa analyst at Expana, a company that reports agricultural commodity prices, said this had resulted in the reversal of a long-term trend. Companies had been cutting back on added sugars over the last 10 years or so in response to consumer preferences, but sugar content has been quietly ticking upward more recently again as it replaces cocoa.\n\nElsewhere, a company might thin out a milk chocolate coating and slip a layer of chocolate compound beneath it. Cookie makers might shrink their chocolate chips, or use fewer, or mix in a combination of “real” and compound chocolate chips, Ms. Frame said.\n\nShoppers rarely notice these sleights of hand, but industry insiders tell a different story.\n\n“We all know each other and we run around behind the scenes and we’re like, can you believe this stuff?” said Eric Schmoyer, technical innovations director at IRCA Group, a chocolate manufacturer.\n\nCocoa prices have come down some since their peak last winter, but analysts predict the supply crunch is here to stay as the planet warms. Demand for chocolate continues to increase, and expanding production takes time. Climate change is expected to stress crops with hotter days and shifting rainfall patterns, but new plantings may be limited by regulations prohibiting deforestation, Mr. Moriarty said.\n\nIn the long run, Dr. Hartel predicts, the chocolate market will split further in response to these pressures: High-end chocolate will most likely continue to be made with the same ingredients and people will continue to pay more and more for it. Companies will continue to look for ways to keep lower-quality chocolates affordable, whether it be through reformulations, shrinking packages or marketing new products that contain less cocoa.\n\nThis last strategy is evident this Halloween season. A Hershey’s Halloween assortment currently on the market includes light-green Kit Kats and Cookies ‘n’ Creme Fangs, neither of which contain any chocolate at all.\n\nSo what happened with the bad chocolate bar that sent me on this journey? I compared product labels and found no changes over five years. Still, plenty else could have been tweaked, the candy scientists told me: The company might have sourced beans from a different region, or compromised with lower-quality beans, or hired a different manufacturer.\n\nOver the last several years, there have been no shortage of scary headlines about the ways the food system could transform as the world gets warmer, making some key crops less nutritious, trigging severe food shortages and widespread hunger. But there are also subtle shifts that have already landed on our plates, and masking them has become both possible and profitable.\n\nThe future may taste like my chocolate bar: A little worse in a hard-to-define way, whether it was made with different beans, less cocoa butter, or more sugar.\n\nThen again, maybe it was just stale.\n\nMira Rojanasakul contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-ultra-orthodox-demonstration-military-draft.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:05:41-04:00","title":"Israel’s Ultra-Orthodox Set for ‘March of the Million’ Against Military Draft","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Israelis, known as Haredim, are gathering in Jerusalem for a 'March of the Million' to protest military draft requirements, amid government efforts to enforce service after the 2023 Hamas attack.

expected to gather in Jerusalem on Thursday for a mass demonstration against efforts to enlist some of them in the military, a protest that is likely to deepen divisions in a country reeling from two years of war.\n\nThe show of force comes amid an attempt by the Israeli government to find a legal and political compromise to end the decades-old practice of granting exemptions from military service to most ultra-Orthodox seminary students.\n\nThat privilege has long stirred widespread public resentment that has become more acute since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Hundreds of soldiers have died in those conflicts, and tens of thousands of reservists have served multiple tours of duty.\n\nMilitary service is compulsory in Israel for most Jewish 18-year-olds, both men and women.\n\nIsrael’s Supreme Court ruled last year that there was no legal basis for allowing the military exemptions and that, in the absence of new legislation, the army must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish men.\n\nThe military has said that it needs 12,000 more soldiers to fill its ranks. Tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox men of draft age currently do not serve.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long relied on the support of ultra-Orthodox parties to remain in power.

A long section of the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway was closed in both directions to all traffic other than buses ferrying demonstrators, while the city’s train station, situated near the western entrance, was also expected to be shut.\n\nThe founders of modern Israel exempted Haredi seminary students from military service when the state was created in 1948, in part to try to rehabilitate the ranks of Torah scholarship that were decimated in the Holocaust.\n\nAt that time, there were only a few hundred such students, but the Haredim now make up at least 13 percent of Israel’s population of 10 million.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/science/nanotyrannus-tyrannosaurus-rex-fossil.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:00:06-04:00","title":"The Case of the Tiny Tyrannosaurus Might Have Been Cracked","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For over four decades, scientists have debated whether small tyrannosaur fossils from the Western United States represent juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex or a previously unrecognized species.

Is Spiking Around the Country\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T05:00:05-04:00\n\nSupported by\n\nNot all states have gotten hit equally hard. The reasons are complex.\n\nBy Brad PlumerHarry Stevens and Rebecca F. Elliott\n\nMillions of Americans have watched with dismay as their electricity bills have spiraled upward over the past few years. The rising price of power is squeezing households and businesses, and voter fury over higher costs is jolting elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia.\n\nPresident Trump, who as a candidate promised to cut electric bills in half within 18 months, has blamed wind and solar power for soaring costs. Democrats say the problem is Mr. Trump’s throttling of renewable energy, while others point to the rapid spread of energy-hungry data centers.\n\nBut the factors driving electricity rates are often more complicated and depend on where you live, according to a comprehensive new study by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nNot all states are suffering equally. Over the past six years, the average retail price of electricity has risen faster than inflation in 26 states. But rates have stayed flat or even declined in the rest of the country in real terms (that is, they’ve grown more slowly than overall inflation).\n\nNote: Prices are for residential electricity, inflation-adjusted to August 2025. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nMany states that have seen a major expansion of wind and solar power, like Nevada or North Dakota, have seen prices stay flat or decline, although there are some important exceptions to this rule. California is a leader in renewable energy but has seen some of the largest electricity rate increases in the country, in part because devastating wildfires have imposed steep costs on utilities, which often get passed onto households. In the Northeast, states have struggled with high natural gas prices.\n\n“There are so many different factors that can drive up electricity prices, depending on where you live,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the Brattle Group, a research firm based in Boston that contributed to the study. “It’s a more nuanced story than what you often see in the headlines.”\n\nThe simplest factor behind surging power prices is inflation. Since 2021, as a result of post-pandemic disruptions, virtually everything has gotten significantly more expensive: food, cars, lumber, equipment, labor. For the most part, the increase in electricity rates nationwide has been in line with overall inflation, although there has been a noticeable acceleration this year.\n\nNational averages can obscure a lot, though, and many states have seen electricity rates rise even faster than inflation, suggesting that there is more to the story.\n\nIn California, average retail prices have risen by a staggering 34 percent since 2019 — even after adjusting for inflation. In New Jersey, prices jumped 11 percent in the past year. In states like Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, prices are rising significantly faster than inflation.\n\nIn Redding, Conn., Janice Rotchstein has noticed electricity prices climb over the past three years. She and her partner have been doing what they can to keep bills in check, including line-drying their clothing, installing more efficient air-conditioning and switching to a different retail electricity provider (something that Connecticut allows). All that helped bring down the bill for their nearly 3,000-square-foot house to $309.68 in September, from $421.85 a year earlier.\n\nEven so, electricity remains one of their biggest monthly expenses. “Our bills have continued to be a problem,” said Ms. Rotchstein, 81. “What we would just love to know is why.”\n\nThe two biggest factors that influence power prices are the cost of generating electricity at a power plant and then delivering those electrons to homes and business through large regional power lines (known as transmission) and the smaller wires snaking through cities (known as distribution).\n\n“When you look at what’s driving electricity bills, it’s really poles and wires,” said Charles Hua, the founder of PowerLines, a nonprofit organization focused on modernizing utility regulations to cut power bills.\n\nInflation-adjusted spending by investor-owned utilities\n\nSource: FERC Form 1 data, compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\nSince 2005, the cost of generating power has declined significantly, partly because the fracking boom has made it much cheaper to extract and burn natural gas, the nation’s largest source of electricity.\n\nBut over that same period, utilities have nearly tripled the amount they spend annually on the network of poles, wires, substations and transformers that deliver power to customers. Large portions of the electric grid are nearing the end of their 50-year life spans and need replacing. Utilities are also hardening lines and equipment to deal with storms, fires and heat waves, particularly as climate change fuels bigger weather disasters.\n\nThis story plays out differently in each state. In California, more than 40 percent of the increase in retail prices since 2019 is attributable to the recent record-breaking wildfires, which have raised insurance costs and forced utilities to replace and upgrade their lines. In Florida, new state laws have required power companies to bury power lines and fortify their electrical substations to prepare for hurricanes.\n\nVarious types of grid equipment — such as transformers — have been in short supply globally and have gotten more expensive. Some critics have accused utilities of overspending on power lines, since they can recoup the costs from customers and earn a guaranteed return, although this can be difficult to quantify.\n\nIn recent years, the United States has seen swift growth in wind and solar power, which together produce 17 percent of the nation’s electricity. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has blamed renewable energy for increasing electricity costs because it can’t run at all hours and requires fossil fuel backup.\n\nYet the Lawrence Berkeley study found a more nuanced story. In regions that have great wind and solar resources — such as the gusty Great Plains or sunny Southwest — renewable energy has boomed and retail electricity prices have either flattened or fallen, after adjusting for inflation. Many of these states, like Iowa or South Dakota, don’t require anyone to use more renewable power; companies build it because it is often the cheapest option to put additional electrons onto the grid.\n\nNote: Prices are for residential electricity, inflation-adjusted to August 2025. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nBut there are exceptions: Several states that aren’t especially windy and sunny have required utilities to buy more electricity from large-scale wind or solar farms, such as Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York. These requirements, which are often adopted to lower greenhouse gas emissions, can add a noticeable surcharge to bills.\n\nMany states — including California, Maine and Massachusetts — have also offered incentives for homeowners to install rooftop solar panels. These policies can raise prices for other customers, because solar households pay less to the utility but still rely on it for backup power. That shifts the cost of maintaining the grid to other households, utilities say. (Solar proponents disagree, saying that this argument ignores many benefits of rooftop panels, such as avoided transmission costs.)\n\nRooftop solar policies accounted for roughly one-quarter of the increase in retail electricity prices in Maine and California since 2019, the Lawrence Berkeley study concluded. More recently, California and some other states have begun paring back their home solar incentives.\n\nYet rising power prices are, in turn, pushing more people toward rooftop solar to lower their bills. Ali Ergun, a 46-year-old hardware engineer, spent around $65,000 this year on solar panels and batteries for his new home in Los Altos Hills, Calif. Solar was not part of Mr. Ergun’s plan when he bought the house, but then he saw his electricity bill, which topped $600 his first month there.\n\n“If you’re at the whims of utility companies’ prices, it’s really a bit nerve wracking,” he said.\n\nOther states have their own stories.\n\nElectricity is expensive in the Northeast because those states rely heavily on imported natural gas and there are a limited number of pipelines into the region, making the fuel costly. (In recent years, New York has blocked new pipelines and closed a nuclear power plant, which deepened the state’s reliance on gas.)\n\nThat left the Northeast vulnerable when gas prices skyrocketed in 2022, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In Maine and Massachusetts, retail prices shot up by more than one-third as a result of these spikes, which have only lately subsided.\n\nIn recent months, many communities have become alarmed by the expansion of massive data centers for artificial intelligence, with some critics warning that these power-hungry facilities will increase electricity costs.\n\nAnd yet in Virginia, home to one of the world’s largest concentrations of data centers, electricity prices have mostly stayed flat over the past six years, adjusting for inflation. If anything, those data centers may have helped suppress prices by allowing utilities to spread the fixed costs of maintaining the grid among a larger set of customers, the Lawrence Berkeley study found.\n\nBut the effects of a rapid data center expansion won’t always be benign, experts cautioned. A lot depends on whether power companies can keep up with the enormous energy needs of new data centers, and whether tech companies or households bear the cost of any needed grid upgrades.\n\nMore ominously, wholesale electric capacity prices have been skyrocketing this year in PJM Interconnection, the large regional grid that supplies Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Virginia. Some analyses have blamed those spikes on new data center demand, which are coming as older coal and nuclear plants are retiring and the grid operator has been slow to connect new renewable and gas plants to replace them.\n\n“Part of the problem is that you can often build new data centers faster than you can build new power plants to supply them,” said Geoffrey Blanford, a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit group that conducts research for the nation’s electric utilities. “And that bottleneck can really drive up costs in the short term.”\n\nThe average price of electricity has been rising faster than inflation this year and government forecasters expect that will continue next year, especially since natural gas prices are starting to climb upward. Politicians are often struggling for answers.\n\nTrump administration officials say the solution is to drill more natural gas and build more pipelines to get that gas where it’s needed.\n\nYet the administration is also trying to make it more difficult and expensive to build new wind and solar projects, while canceling federal grants for grid upgrades aimed at lowering costs. While it will take time for the full impact of those restrictions to be felt, experts say, they are expected to put upward pressure on electricity prices later this decade.\n\nSome states are exploring ways to blunt price shocks by requiring tech companies to absorb more of the cost of adding new data centers or encouraging those data centers to operate more flexibly so that they limit the strain on the grid. Others are considering technological options that could cut costs, such as deploying more batteries.\n\nThe problem is pressing. More than 24 percent of households were unable to pay their energy bills in full in 2024, according to Census Bureau data, up from 20 percent in 2021.\n\n“It’s a perfect storm of misery for low-and-middle income households,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/europe/inside-louvre-jewel-heist.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:01:09Z","title":"Inside the Heist That Shocked the World","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 19, 2025, a massive heist occurred at the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery, where thieves stole over $100 million in jewels, including Napoleon’s wedding necklace and Marie-Amelie’s royal jewelry.

Inside the Heist That Shocked the World\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T00:01:09-04:00\n\nHolly Barker and her husband, Jake, were third in line at the Louvre the morning of Oct. 19.\n\nThe couple from Indianapolis had a plan — head straight for the Mona Lisa, before the crowds, then shoot toward Delacroix’s “Liberty Leading the People” and a famous painting of Napoleon by Jacques-Louis David. Fourth stop was a place they had heard was a mini version of Versailles’ Hall of Mirrors: the Apollo Gallery, with its collection of royal jewels.\n\nIt was 9:32 when Ms. Barker stepped inside the gilded hall and took a photo. As Ms. Barker stopped to admire a wedding gift that Napoleon had given his second wife — a necklace glittering with 32 emeralds and more than 1,100 diamonds — she heard the first of three loud bangs. It was 9:34, and masked thieves were about to barge through the window.\n\nThe room froze, suspended for a moment of confusion, according to her husband, who locked eyes with her. Then they heard a piercing sound from the balcony outside: The thieves were firing up a disc grinder that could cut through reinforced glass.\n\n“The attendant said ‘Everyone get out,’” said Ms. Barker, a middle-school teacher who participated in enough active-shooter drills to convince her this was a terrorist attack.\n\nShe and her husband clasped hands and rushed from the gallery with the 20 or so other visitors. They turned back only once, as the same attendant pulled the doors closed and shouted “Run!”\n\nIt would be about 90 minutes before the Barkers learned they had been witness to the biggest heist at the world’s most famous museum since 1911, when the Mona Lisa was stolen.\n\nMore than a week after the burglary, in which thieves made off with more than $100 million worth of jewels in broad daylight, the country is still reeling, stunned by its brazenness, shocked by the clear security failures, and less and less hopeful the jewelry will be recovered intact.\n\nMuch is still unknown by the public, including whether the thieves scouted the location as experts say museum robbers do, and whether they had any help from an accomplice within the museum.\n\nBut a picture of the crime has started to emerge, in testimony by French authorities, interviews with Louvre staff and local media reports. It suggests that the thieves had a careful plan, which included stealing the truck-mounted electric ladder they used to reach the second floor. They posed as workmen complete with yellow vests and seemed to have an exact idea of which cases they wanted to break into. (One was the case Ms. Barker had been admiring.)\n\nAnd they cut hand-sized holes with specialized tools that the Louvre’s own firefighting manual says are efficient for opening cases if there’s a blaze. Experts said the cases that display museums’ most valuable items are normally designed to withstand some 140 hammer blows or ax strikes, enough to exhaust a thief, and they called the use of disc grinders innovative.\n\nStill, information leaking out also shows that in the end, the thieves were as frazzled as they had been careful. In their rush to escape, they left a trove of evidence that led the police directly to two of them so far.\n\nOn Saturday night, the police arrested the two men they believe entered the gallery and late Wednesday night formally charged them with thefts committed by an organized gang and criminal association. They caught one man at Charles de Gaulle airport, the Paris prosecutor said, as he was attempting to leave with a one-way ticket to Algeria. The second was arrested 40 minutes later near his home in a Paris suburb. Their two accomplices remain at large.\n\n“How do you do all that, and then get caught at the airport?” said Brian Ledsinger from Houston, Texas, who was also in the Apollo Gallery when the thieves broke in. “They were amateurs who were also smart.”\n\nFor the Louvre, the fatal flaw was the weaknesses in its security system, especially its perimeter cameras, the museum’s director, Laurence des Cars, admitted to the French Senate last week. The outdoor cameras are very old, she told a hearing, and so scarce that they don’t cover the entire facade.\n\nOn a recent visit to the museum, a Times reporter counted about 25 cameras on the museum’s perimeter, only five of which were on the outer walls rather than inner courtyards. The British Museum says it has several dozen surveying its much smaller perimeter. In response to questions, the Louvre said it would not comment on the external cameras.\n\nThe museum’s\n\ndirector said this\n\ncamera did not\n\ncapture the\n\nQuai François Mitterrand\n\nArts Décoratifs\n\nArts Décoratifs\n\nQuai François Mitterrand\n\nApollo Gallery\n\nWhere thieves broke in\n\nSeine River\n\nThe museum’s director\n\nsaid this camera did not\n\ncapture the balcony.\n\nSource: OpenStreetMap (basemap)\n\nCatherine Porter and Samuel Granados/The New York Times\n\nBut perhaps most important, the site the thieves targeted was covered by a single outdoor security camera — and it was aimed west of the balcony, so it did not capture the break-in, the museum director said.\n\nHad the camera been positioned differently, it could have shown security guards in the museum’s control room the thieves ascending to the balcony on the electric ladder. Instead the guards were blind for the four critical minutes it took the intruders to get in place before they began cutting the window, delaying calls to the police.\n\nBut on Wednesday a police official acknowledged in testimony to the Senate that they, too, had a role in protecting the museum’s perimeter and had suffered their own lapse. Vincent Annereau, the head of the Paris police crime prevention service, said the police have seven street cameras around the Louvre, and one had captured the thieves’ arrival, but no one noticed, or suspected a problem, until they received alerts that a burglary was in progress. He blamed the oversight on the fact that construction work is commonplace in Paris and that the police do not have artificial intelligence to help monitor the cameras.\n\nThe camera was positioned in the opposite direction, the museum’s director said.\n\nElectric ladder\n\nused by the\n\nThe camera was positioned in the opposite direction, the museum’s director said.\n\nElectric ladder\n\nused by the\n\nThe camera was positioned in the opposite direction, the museum’s director said.\n\nElectric ladder used\n\nby the thieves\n\nSource: Photo by Dimitar Dilkoff /AFP via Getty Images\n\nSamuel Granados/The New York Times\n\nBased on the timing of the break-in provided so far by various officials, including the museum’s director, it seems likely that the police missed the intruders by less than a minute. It took officers just three minutes to arrive after they were notified by museum staff and a passing cyclist, the Paris police chief said. But they had been notified only after the thieves began to carve into the display cases — and the intruders rushed away with eight precious items less than three minutes later.\n\nFour thieves arrived at 9:30 and parked their truck. Two ascended the ladder. The others remained with the getaway vehicles: two motor scooters.\n\nAfter barging into the gallery, the first thief headed directly to the display case where Ms. Barker had been moments before, according to a report in the French newspaper Le Parisien that summarized confidential museum surveillance footage of the crime that its reporter saw. The targeted case was not the closest to the window, but fifth in a line that stretched down the 200-foot gallery. Alongside Napoleon’s wedding gift, it contained a sapphire necklace and matching tiara and earrings that had belonged to France’s last queen, Marie-Amelie.\n\nThe second thief, who was wearing a motorcycle helmet, attacked the neighboring case.\n\nBy the Louvre’s standards, the cases were relatively new, built in 2019 with reinforced glass that can withstand bullets. In the event of a fire, they were also designed to be broken by firefighters, a former senior member of Louvre’s firefighting unit told The New York Times.\n\nAlarms began sounding in the guards’ control room when the window was breached, and new alerts were sent as the thieves attacked the two cases, according to the museum director’s testimony. From that room, the museum’s chief operations manager called the closest police station, just over half a mile away, the Louvre’s head of security, Dominique Buffin, told senators last week. The manager also pressed an emergency alert button, alerting the central police prefecture as well.\n\nThe footage seen by Le Parisien showed what happened next in the gallery, the newspaper reported. The thieves remained calm while working, even as two museum guards tried to scare them off. One approached with a metal pole, but one of the intruders waved him back.\n\nThen the burglars’ composure seemed to crack; they got sloppy. One dropped some jewelry and stopped to stuff it back into his bag, but the burglars left a glove and jeweled brooch behind. The footage also showed the helmeted thief diving head first into the ladder’s basket, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office declined to comment on Le Parisien’s report.\n\nA video posted on X and corroborated by Storyful, a company that reviews social media content, appears to show the suspects escaping by riding down the mechanical ladder.\n\nA museum attendant told the French television channel BFM that he and some colleagues had heard an alert and rushed outside from the museum’s lobby and down to the street toward where the thieves had parked. They arrived just as the motor scooters drove away.\n\nThe guard said they found holes in the truck’s gas tank and a blowtorch nearby — a sign that the thieves had likely hoped to burn the truck to destroy evidence.\n\nInstead, they left behind a cache of evidence, including power tools, gloves, a motorcycle helmet and one of the yellow vests they wore, the authorities say.\n\nThey also dropped the crown of Empress Eugénie.\n\n“Even when well-prepared, thieves often make mistakes due to rushing,” said Olivier Halnais, the head of the national union of forensic police officers.\n\nHe described what was left behind as a treasure trove for investigators, saying a helmet, for instance, would be “very rich” with DNA from sweat and saliva droplets, and that samples could be matched with the millions in a national database.\n\nLaure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor, said on Wednesday that investigators had processed 150 forensic samples, including DNA traces and fingerprints, at the crime scene and on objects left behind. One of the thief’s DNA was found on the broken window and other things, she said. The other’s was on a motor scooter found by police.\n\nThe more than 100 officers on the case have been racing to catch the perpetrators before they could break the jewelry into individual stones and melt the metals down for sale. So far, no recovery has been announced.\n\nThat has left a profound sense of loss, at the Louvre and beyond.\n\nIn a written response to questions, the museum’s decorative arts director, Olivier Gabet, said he had entered the Apollo Gallery the night of the heist to help the police. He was “overwhelmed by the icy silence of the place,” and struck by the sight of the stands where the precious objects had rested. They were mostly empty, though he said the thieves had missed a few items.\n\nMr. Ledsinger, the Houston resident who was visiting the Apollo Gallery on that fateful morning, was evacuated before he got to see the snatched jewels. “That’s world history,” he said, he said of the items. “That’s why we are there, to see and experience and to immerse ourselves in what it was like back then.”\n\nMs. Barker, who was mesmerized by the jewels before rushing out with her husband, said she keeps watching the news back in Indianapolis, hoping the jewels — including the emerald and diamond necklace she admired — are recovered intact.\n\n“I think I’m one of the last people to see that necklace and admire it,” she said.\n\nSégolène Le Stradic and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris and Alex Marshall from London.\n\n"}]}
