The judge said that Halligan – the only prosecutor to present the case on behalf of the Justice Department – may have misstated the law to the grand jurors in a way that compromised the proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “Here, the procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr. Comey,” the judge wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Access to evidence from a previous investigation\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick said the Justice Department accessed old evidence it seized in searches of online accounts from Comey’s friend and then-lawyer Daniel Richman, for a prior leak investigation that didn’t result in charges.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said DOJ did so without a new court-approved search warrant. Nor did investigators take time this year to sift out confidential attorney-client communications when it charged Comey at the end of September, knowing some of that evidence might not be able to be used, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “This cavalier attitude towards a basic tenet of the Fourth Amendment and multiple court orders left the government unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized” from the prior investigation of Richman, Fitzpatrick wrote, “and apparently, in the government’s eyes, to do so again anytime they chose.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge had said Comey’s defense team should get access to the grand jury records on Monday, but the Justice Department is still trying to challenge that decision and is holding back the records as another trial-court judge looks at the issues. The Justice Department said in a filing on Monday following Fitzpatrick’s ruling that Comey’s attorney-client confidentiality may not even have been breached by investigators, and that Comey shouldn’t be able to reach beyond grand jury secrecy rules at this point of the case.\n \n\n   \n  The court could move fast to resolve the dispute over whether Comey’s team gets access to the grand jury records as soon as this weekend, with little additional ability in a criminal proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “These materials are essential if Mr. Comey is to fully and fairly defend himself in the face of the irregularities that have characterized this investigation from its inception,” Fitzpatrick wrote on Monday. “The Court finds that the institutional concerns for grand jury secrecy are greatly outweighed by Mr. Comey’s right to Due Process.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge called the Justice Department’s decision this fall not to seek a new search warrant that would have been court approved to access the old evidence from Richman “inexplicable” and “highly unusual.” He also noted that it was “foreseeable” Richman’s electronic devices might contain attorney-client communications with Comey, and the department had known this for years, even excluding Comey from its evidence processing years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Later Monday evening, Fitzpatrick’s order that would allow Comey’s defense team to access grand jury records was temporarily paused by the federal judge overseeing the entire case.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have until Wednesday to make their argument over court filings to why the order should be dissolved, the federal judge said. Comey’s attorneys will then have until Friday to reply to the objections prosecutors raise.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also revealed for the first time that an agent had warned others at the FBI about the use of Richman’s data on the same day Comey was indicted in September — just a few days before the window in which the department could bring a case would close.\n \n\n   \n  One of the FBI agents who had been warned of potentially tainted evidence, the judge said, still “proceeded into the grand jury undeterred,” testifying to the grand jurors as the only witness, about evidence from the old searches of Richman.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury presentation\n \n\n   \n  The judge also slammed statements Halligan made to the grand jury, adding that the prosecutor appears to have made a “fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law” regarding Comey’s ability to testify at his own trial and about his legal burdens if he were charged. The exact words Halligan said to the grand jury are redacted in the judge’s opinion on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  But Fitzpatrick, who has read the grand jury transcript, said grand jurors seemed to believe Halligan was telling them that Comey would have to answer questions at trial that she couldn’t during the proceeding, where prosecutors privately present the case to the grand jurors. The judge said Halligan implied to the grand jury that Comey may have to testify at his own trial to win his case — even though the Fifth Amendment gives defendants the protection to decline to testify so as not to incriminate themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the judge noted that Halligan suggested to the grand jury the Justice Department had more and better evidence it could use against Comey later at trial, another potentially problematic statement by the prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s team will be able to ask the court to suppress the use of core evidence in his case or to dismiss charges against him - including because of what Halligan and the FBI agent witness said to the grand jurors by next week.\n \n\n   \n  The case, alleging Comey lied to Congress in 2020 about his interactions with Richman, currently is set to go to trial just after New Year’s Day. A separate judge is weighing whether Halligan has the authority to have secured the indictment against Comey, given that she is not a Senate-confirmed political appointee.\n \n\n   \n    Timing of grand jury hearing\n \n\n   \n  The magistrate judge also raised significant questions about the timing of the grand jury deliberations and two hours for which there is no grand jury transcript, which Halligan has outlined in a sworn statement recently and said tracked with the grand jury’s deliberations, which wouldn’t have been recorded.\n \n\n   \n  “If the prosecutor is mistaken about the time she received notification of the grand jury’s vote on the original indictment, and this procedure did take place, then the transcript and audio recording provided to the Court are incomplete,” Fitzpatrick also wrote. “If this procedure did not take place, then the Court is in uncharted legal territory in that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.”\n \n\n   \n  “Either way, this unusual series of events, still not fully explained by the prosecutor’s declaration, calls into question the presumption of regularity generally associated with grand jury proceedings, and provides another genuine issue the defense may raise to challenge the manner in which the government obtained the indictment,” Fitzpatrick added.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-bengals-chase-suspended-spitting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-05:00","title":"Bengals receiver Ja’Marr Chase suspended 1 game by NFL for spitting on Steelers’ Jalen Ramsey","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase was suspended one game without pay by the NFL for spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey during a fourth-quarter confrontation.

Michelle Watson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:31 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The expected price tag to rebuild Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge – the  overpass that collapsed  and  left six dead  – has more than doubled and is expected to be completed later than what authorities previously said, according to a  release  on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The Maryland Transportation Authority on Monday  said  in a release the updated cost estimate is now projected to be $4.3 billion to $5.2 billion, with an expected opening in late 2030 – a two-year delay from the earlier estimate.\n \n\n   \n  That price tag is more than double the previous expected cost of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, that the Maryland Department of Transportation  previously confirmed  to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The bridge – a vital artery for traffic heading into the Port of Baltimore and a major hub for imports and exports of commodities – fell apart after a cargo ship hit one of its pillars in the early hours of March 26, 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The container ship, Dali, suffered a pair of catastrophic electrical failures minutes before the crash,  according  to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board. The agency is  expected  to hold a public board meeting Tuesday about its investigation into what caused the ship to hit the bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “Preliminary cost and project time estimates were made less than two weeks after the initial crash and before any engineering or design studies were conducted,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore  said  in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Since then, national economic conditions have deteriorated and material costs have increased. At the same time, elevated costs have resulted from federal design and resilience standards — not discretionary state choices,” he  said .\n \n\n   \n    NTSB preliminary report findings\n \n\n   \n  As many as 35,000 cars and trucks per day traveled across Baltimore’s bridge, also known as the Key Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  In the early morning of March 26, 2024, two power outages occurred three ships’ lengths from the bridge and were triggered by the tripping of two critical circuit breakers, which caused several pumps required for the ship’s single propeller and its single rudder to stop working, a preliminary report from the NTSB  said .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency generator was not configured to power the ship, the agency added.\n \n\n   \n  The ship at the time of the failure was under the control of an apprentice pilot, who was accompanied by a senior pilot. When the pilots boarded, the captain reported the ship was in good working order, according to the report.  NTSB investigators said  the crewmembers tested negative for drugs and alcohol, and the fuel tested negative for contaminants three times.\n \n\n   \n  The six construction workers who fell to their death  were immigrants from four countries  – Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala.\n \n\n   \n   Then-President Joe Biden  said  he was committed to helping rebuild the bridge as soon as possible and said the federal government would bear the costs.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement Monday, Moore said his administration will continue to provide updates and rebuild, “as safely, quickly, and efficiently as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,” Moore  said . “And we will keep Marylanders continuously apprised of construction progress.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/trump-epstein-files-reluctant-reversal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:12:00-05:00","title":"The prospect of an embarrassing defeat convinced Trump to reverse course on Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed his opposition to the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files after realizing that continued resistance would lead to a politically damaging defeat in Congress.

But that doesn’t mean he’s happy about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump threw his support behind a congressional effort to release all the files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after it became clear that he could not halt its momentum and that he risked suffering an embarrassing blow on the House floor, people familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The stark reality, which was conveyed to Trump by allies and advisers in recent days, drove the president’s abrupt reversal Sunday evening and his comments Monday that he’ll sign the measure if it comes to his desk. It’s a decision he came to reluctantly, but one that is now likely to clear the way for the measure’s overwhelming passage in the House on Tuesday and for the Senate to take it up after that.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure, I would,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Monday when asked whether he’d sign the measure.\n \n\n   \n  It was a rare moment of retreat for a president who has made a habit of bending Washington to his will since returning to office. And it came after the White House privately tried and failed last week to pressure a handful of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support for the measure, and days after Trump attacked those defectors as “soft and foolish.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again,” the president wrote in one post on Truth Social. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republicans would fall into that trap.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remains personally frustrated by the continuing focus on the Epstein files, the people familiar with the matter said, viewing them as a distraction from his agenda that Democrats have since co-opted as fodder for political attacks. The president resents being tied to Epstein, who he has said he cut ties with well before Epstein was charged with any crimes, and has been irritated at the central role some of his close allies have played in the campaign for the files, those people said.\n \n\n   \n  Just 48 hours before flipping his stance on the Epstein files, Trump attacked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in bitterly personal terms over her strident support for the House measure, withdrawing his endorsement and labeling the Georgia Republican a “traitor.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump ultimately shifted his own position after advisers and allies convinced him that the House measure’s passage was inevitable despite his best efforts — and that fighting it was only fueling more attention.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in what one of the people familiar with the matter characterized as a tactical move, Trump and his allies are hoping that backing the speedy passage of the measure will allow Republicans to move past the issue more quickly and give the administration an opening to refocus attention on policy efforts that Trump has complained are going ignored.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll just get this done and move it on,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday” over the weekend. “There’s nothing to hide.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson on Monday suggested he may vote for the measure after months of siding with Trump against it, citing new optimism that the Senate will “be able to correct” some of his concerns over its language.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since adopted that attitude, encouraging Republicans on Monday to shift their focus to areas that are viewed as far more crucial to next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “All I want is I want for people to recognize a great job that I’ve done on pricing, on affordability,” he said. “I don’t want to take it away from really the greatness of what the Republican Party has accomplished.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump in the meantime has also sought to turn the Epstein issue against Democrats, ordering a Justice Department investigation of the former financier’s ties to a range of people including former President Bill Clinton and prominent economic adviser  Larry Summers . (Neither has been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and nor has Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson cited the probe as evidence that Trump has wanted “transparency related to the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s announcement has sparked fresh questions about whether the Justice Department could then cite the open investigation in refusing to turn over documents to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN that Trump has not ordered the department to stand in the way of any congressional requests, but it’s unclear how it will respond if the House measure is ultimately signed into law.\n \n\n   \n  That consideration, though, is likely weeks away. The Senate is due to break for a Thanksgiving recess at the end of the week, meaning it likely could not take up the measure until December at the earliest. And despite the broad bipartisan support in the House, Senate Majority Leader John Thune remains uncommitted on bringing the Epstein measure to the floor quickly, or even at all, a GOP leadership aide said.\n \n\n   \n  That provides the White House with an opening that allies hope Trump can take advantage of to refocus voters and elevate the far more advantageous elements of his agenda, the people familiar with the matter said — for at least as long as they can keep the Epstein issue at bay.\n \n\n   \n  “It never fully gets tamped … and part of that is just the sheer fact that a conspiracy theory never goes away,” said Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist. “Trump has ways of distracting and turning our attention away, but what’s to say it doesn’t pop up two months down the road or six months down the road?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself alluded to that on Monday when voicing his support for releasing the files.\n \n\n   \n  “No matter what we give, it’s never enough,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/indiana-house-cleaner-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"Indiana Homeowner Charged in Fatal Shooting of House Cleaner Who Showed Up at the Wrong Door","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Indiana homeowner, Curt Andersen, was charged with voluntary manslaughter after fatally shooting Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez, a house cleaner who arrived at the wrong house and attempted to open the door with keys.

homeowner accused of  killing a house cleaner  who mistakenly arrived at his front door was charged with voluntary manslaughter on Monday in a case that could test the limits of stand-your-ground laws.\n \n\n   \n  Curt Andersen, 62, could face anywhere from 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if he’s convicted. He was being held in the Boone County Jail pending an initial court hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Officers found Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez, 32, dead on the front porch of a home in Whitestown, an Indianapolis suburb, on Nov. 5. Authorities said the Guatemalan immigrant was part of a cleaning crew that  went to the wrong house just before 7 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  Andersen shot her through the front door with no warning about a minute after hearing someone trying to unlock the door, according to a probable cause statement.\n \n\n   \n  Rios’ husband told media outlets that he was with her on the porch. He didn’t realize she had been shot until she fell back into his arms, bleeding. On a fundraising page, her brother described Rios as a mother of four children.\n \n\n   \n    Case puts stand-your-ground law in the spotlight\n \n\n   \n  Indiana is one of 31 states with a stand-your-ground law that permits homeowners to use deadly force to stop someone they believe is trying to unlawfully enter their dwelling. But police said that there’s no evidence Rios entered the home before she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Andersen’s attorney, Guy Relford, posted a statement on X saying he was disappointed that prosecutors charged his client. He said Andersen had every reason to believe his actions were justified and the stand-your-ground law clearly protects him.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Andersen’s actions must be evaluated based on the circumstances as he perceived them,” Relford said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Boone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood told reporters at a news conference that the decision to charge Andersen wasn’t difficult. Stand-your-ground protections don’t apply because Andersen lacked enough information to know if his actions were reasonable, Eastwood said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor said he planned to prove that Andersen couldn’t have reasonably believed he needed to use deadly force, given what he knew at the time.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Commotion at the door’\n \n\n   \n  According to the probable cause statement, Andersen told investigators that he and his wife were asleep in an upstairs bedroom when he heard a “commotion at the door” that grew more intense. He thought someone was using keys or tools on the front door.\n \n\n   \n  Frightened, he went to the top of the stairwell and saw through the home’s windows that two people were outside the front door. He said to himself, “What am I going to do? It’s not going away and I have to do something now.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he loaded his handgun, went back to the windows and saw the people “thrusting” at the door and getting more aggressive, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  He fired one shot toward the door. He said the door never opened and he didn’t announce himself or say anything before he pulled the trigger.\n \n\n   \n  When told he had killed Rios, he put his head down on the table and said he didn’t mean for anything to happen to anybody.\n \n\n   \n    Wife says Andersen told a neighbor he would shoot any intruder\n \n\n   \n  Andersen’s wife, Yoshie Andersen, told investigators that her husband told her that he told a neighbor if anyone tried to break into his house he would shoot them. The probable cause statement does not say when this conversation happened.\n \n\n   \n  She added that her husband fired the shot from the top of the stairs and neither of them went downstairs. He fired the shot and then told her to call 911, she said.\n \n\n   \n    No evidence of forcible entry\n \n\n   \n  Investigators found a bullet hole in the door, but no evidence of any forceful contact with the door itself, the latch or the door frame, according to the probable cause statement.\n \n\n   \n  Rios’ husband, Mauricio Velasquez, told investigators that she tried to open the door with keys from their cleaning company, but they unknowingly were at the wrong address. He said they’d been trying to open the door for 30 seconds to a minute before she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  He said they never heard any voices from inside or saw any movement. The couple didn’t knock, bang on the door or use force of any kind to enter the home and they never got inside, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Stand-your-ground cases elsewhere\n \n\n   \n  The shooting echoes a similar episode in Missouri in 2023 when  an 86-year-old man shot Ralph Yarl  after the 16-year-old Black teenager came to his door by mistake. Missouri has a similar stand-your-ground law, but prosecutors charged the shooter, Andrew Lester, with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and didn’t go to trial.\n \n\n   \n  In New York, which does not have a stand-your-ground law, a  man was convicted in 2024 of second-degree murder  for fatally shooting a woman inside a car who mistakenly came down the driveway of his rural upstate home.\n \n\n   \n  Jody Madeira, an Indiana University law professor who specializes in gun rights, said last week that the Rios case was “horrible” and “exceptionally unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  In general, the public can legally access private property — including a front porch — for a legitimate purpose until they are told to leave, Madeira said. For example, a homeowner can’t legally shoot a pizza delivery person or an Amazon driver just for stepping onto their property, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Madeira said Monday that the allegations in the probable cause statement show that Curt Andersen was acting out of fear but that’s not enough to invoke the stand-your-ground law. There was no unlawful entry and trying to insert a key into a lock or rattling a doorknob isn’t a reasonable justification for firing a shot, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The reasonable person says, ‘hey, I have my phone here, I have other options, I can shout a warning. It’s 7 a.m., is someone really breaking into my house? He jumped up from bed and immediately went into I’m combatting a break-in.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/fema-chief-david-richardson-steps-down","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00.000-05:00","title":"FEMA chief steps down as Trump administration prepared to oust him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Richardson, the acting chief of FEMA, has stepped down after months of controversy and public criticism, including a notable absence during catastrophic floods in Texas in July 2025.

to oust him \n       \n  By Gabe Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:06 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The embattled acting chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will step down after hurricane season following months of public controversy and internal frustration.\n \n\n   \n  David Richardson submitted a resignation letter on Monday to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, giving two weeks’ notice, the department told CNN. However, plans were already in the works at the agency to oust him from the role, three sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson, a loyalist to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, was tapped to lead FEMA even though he lacked experience in disaster management. But his time in charge has been punctuated by some eyebrow-raising moments — like in a June meeting in which he told staff he  was unaware the US has a hurricane season,  a comment DHS later insisted was a joke.\n \n\n   \n  His impending departure raises the stakes for FEMA — the agency responsible for helping Americans recover from the nation’s worst disasters — as Noem and DHS prepare for sweeping reforms that could fundamentally reshape its future.\n \n\n   \n  A FEMA official with knowledge of the decision said Karen Evans, a close Trump administration ally at DHS and FEMA’s newly appointed chief of staff, will replace Richardson.   A DHS spokesperson later said in a statement that Evans will will start in her new role on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the agencies thanked Richardson “for his dedicated service and wish him continued success in his return to the private sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s leadership faced its toughest test in July, when  catastrophic floods devastated Texas  and killed more than 130 people. As the crisis unfolded, Richardson was on vacation and unreachable for hours. He later told lawmakers he spent the entire trip in his truck, glued to his phone, coordinating the response.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Richardson was publicly silent and absent from the flood zone, surfacing more than a week later for an unannounced visit to Texas — days after President Donald Trump and Noem toured the area. He arrived in a straw hat and cowboy boots, notably lacking any FEMA insignia — a striking departure from the typical image of agency leaders on the front lines of a crisis.\n \n\n   \n  His absence was not by chance. DHS leaders had instructed FEMA to keep Richardson’s Texas trip under wraps until he left the state, deliberately shielding him from the press, three sources with knowledge of the decision said.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson later defended his leadership and told lawmakers the DHS response in Texas was a “model for how to respond to a disaster.”\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, the FEMA administrator is the president’s right hand for natural disasters and national emergencies. But in Trump’s second term, Richardson has been largely pushed to the sidelines, with his authority steadily diminished by Noem.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Monday, Richardson defended his short tenure at FEMA, arguing that he “didn’t hesitate” to take on the leadership post just weeks before hurricane season began.\n \n\n   \n  “I agreed to be the acting administrator through hurricane season when others wouldn’t. Hurricane season ends on 1 December. Since the danger has largely passed, I can now leave for other opportunities,” he said. “Many were asked. One raised his hand and said, ‘I’ll do it.’”\n \n\n   \n    Criticism of Richardson’s leadership at FEMA\n \n\n   \n  A former Marine combat veteran, martial arts instructor and  painter,  Richardson previously led the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office at DHS but had no experience managing natural disasters when he was tapped for the FEMA role in May.  His predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, also a Trump administration appointee, was fired  for clashing with senior homeland security officials and opposing the administration’s push to eliminate FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  “He never should have been there to begin with,” Hamilton, who worked with Richardson during his time in the administration, told CNN this week. “The two words I’d use to describe him are unprofessional and overwhelmed.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s appointment marked a turning point as DHS tightened its grip on FEMA, installing loyalists in key positions and pushing out veteran disaster experts. Unlike Hamilton, Richardson was seen as someone who would follow orders. He’s a personal friend of longtime Trump ally  Corey Lewandowski, who is helping Noem run DHS  as her chief adviser.\n \n\n   \n  On his first day, Richardson told FEMA staff he alone spoke for the agency and warned he would “run right over” anyone who didn’t fall in line.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials describe his leadership as brash and unpredictable, with a penchant for shouting and swearing. On one occasion, he asked staff whether disaster funds could be steered to Republican areas but not Democratic ones, a FEMA official who heard the comments firsthand said.\n \n\n   \n  At times, Richardson prohibited staff from bringing cell phones and computers into meetings. He often kept his own phone out of sight and rarely used email, leaving senior FEMA leaders struggling to reach him and making even basic communication a constant challenge.\n \n\n   \n  Over the months, Noem and her team had grown frustrated with Richardson’s distracting antics and failure to effectively communicate their FEMA reforms to Congress and the public, three sources with knowledge of the conversations told CNN. But senior leaders ultimately decided it made more sense to wait until after hurricane season to remove him.\n \n\n   \n  The department has steadily reduced his role, treating him more as a liability than an asset. DHS has repeatedly blocked his requests to speak at conventions or to lead public information campaigns about hurricane season, two sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Have you heard him speak?” an administration official told CNN. “He does more damage than good.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent months, the department has reassigned some of Richardson’s closest allies and surrounded him with senior staff who have further limited his authority.\n \n\n   \n    FEMA’s future at a crossroads\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Richardson’s removal is significant. Once hurricane season ends at the end of the month, the administration is set to fast-track its sweeping transformation of FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  The new FEMA Review Council, which is headed by Noem, will soon deliver its much-anticipated report, outlining recommendations to reshape the agency. As the dust settles, FEMA’s future — and its ability to respond when disaster strikes — hangs in the balance.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, dozens of lawmakers have signed on to a bipartisan bill known as the “FEMA Act” that would remove the agency from DHS and make it independent — a change Noem vehemently opposes, multiple sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Noem have been  overhauling FEMA since taking office  as they vow to shift more responsibility for disaster preparedness, response and recovery onto states. While they once called for the agency’s outright elimination, their tone has shifted in recent months, signaling a dramatic restructuring may be in store. Either way, current and former high-ranking FEMA officials have  warned that growing turmoil at the agency is putting Americans at risk .\n \n\n   \n  More than a quarter of the agency’s full-time staff have left through layoffs and buyouts — including dozens of longtime senior leaders — and morale has plummeted amid frequent public attacks from administration officials, including Noem and Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has benefited from the mildest hurricane season in a decade, with no hurricanes making landfall anywhere in the US for the first time since 2015.\n \n\n   \n  “FEMA likely would have failed had there been a major disaster,” a former high-ranking FEMA official told CNN. “Having no big disasters has absolutely played into the Trump narrative that there is no need for FEMA. And it hasn’t allowed the American people to see just how bad they need the agency, since the states just aren’t prepared.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/ariana-grande-wicked-singapore-intrusion-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"21:30:00-05:00","title":"Serial intruder who accosted Ariana Grande at Wicked premiere in Singapore sentenced to 9 days in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Johnson Wen, a 26-year-old Australian serial stage intruder known as 'Pyjama Man,' was sentenced to nine days in prison in Singapore for causing public annoyance during a Wicked: For Good premiere, where he rushed and physically approached pop star Ariana Grande.

classified as an official state visit as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia’s head of state. That position is occupied by his 89-year-old father, King Salman. But the crown prince has assumed almost all day-to-day responsibility for ruling the kingdom, and attends summits and other diplomatic engagements as the country’s leader.\n \n\n   \n  On the eve of Prince bin Salman’s first visit to the White House in more than seven years, Trump announced that the US would be selling F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia — a controversial step that could alter the military balance in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been a great ally,” Trump told reporters. “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has worked to cultivate a close relationship with the kingdom’s de facto ruler in the hopes he will decide to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, which would be a major advancement of the president’s signature Abraham Accords — a longtime goal of the president’s.\n \n\n   \n  “The Abraham Accords will be a part we’re going to be discussing,” Trump said Friday. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.”\n \n\n   \n  The prince last visited Washington in 2018, months before the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. A CIA assessment released afterward found the prince had likely ordered the assassination, though he has long denied any involvement. Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, Khashoggi’s widow, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto of the planned White House meeting: “It’s very painful for me. It will be better if Jamal was here and receiving the crown prince by himself and meet with him and share with him his vision and mission, and all of his ideas.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump never entirely cut off ties with the crown prince during his first term, though he wasn’t invited back to the White House. Even Trump’s successor President Joe Biden, who vowed as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its human rights record, visited Riyadh while in office and fist bumped Prince bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  With Tuesday’s visit, any semblance of a rupture in US-Saudi ties appears to have disappeared. The plans include a welcome ceremony involving military bands, a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office and a black-tie dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  The first tranche of invitations were sent out earlier this month and the guest list includes largely chief executives, as well as lawmakers and governors — some of whom Trump himself called to invite to the dinner, people familiar with the plans said. The event is being coordinated by first lady Melania Trump, as all state visits are planned through the first lady’s office.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to hold a state visit in his second term, which is typically put on as a sign of friendship and to display the close relationship the US shares with its allies, during his second term. Trump broke with tradition during his first administration by opting not to hold a state dinner during his first year in office, though he went on to host the president of France and prime minister of Australia in 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit,” a White House official said in a statement to CNN. “We will not get ahead of the President on conversations that are occurring ahead of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia is also planning an investment summit to coincide with the crown prince’s trip to Washington. The event at the Kennedy Center, a day after the White House visit, is intended to link up American and Saudi business leaders for financial opportunities.\n \n\n   \n  In May, Trump visited Saudi Arabia for the first state visit of his second term and was welcomed with  elaborate pageantry , including a fighter jet escort, an honor guard with golden swords and a fleet of Arabian horses accompanying his limousine. The president has sought to deepen ties to other Gulf states during his tenure, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n \n\n   \n  Before the May stop, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the United States. Trump brought several American executives with him to Riyadh, and signed several agreements. Many have yet to be fully implemented.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s meetings, US and Saudi officials were working to finalize agreements on defense and security cooperation, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Riyadh has long sought the F-35s, one of the most advanced military jets in the world. But Israel — the only country in the Middle East with the jets — is worried about maintaining its military edge. Congress could block export licenses for the F-35s to Saudi Arabia, though it’s unusual.\n \n\n   \n    Discussions about normalizing relations with Israel\n \n\n   \n  Atop Trump’s agenda will be a discussion of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, a step he believes is within reach after he helped broker a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The October 7, 2023, terror attack in Israel, and the war that followed, largely put on hold the normalization discussions that began during Trump’s first term and advanced during Biden’s. A framework being discussed before the attacks would include a US defense treaty with Saudi Arabia and help building a civilian nuclear program in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Biden and many of his top aides have said they believe the October 7 attack was intended, in part, to obstruct the normalization talks. Now that a ceasefire is in place, Trump believes a deal can be quickly reached.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in,” Trump told Fox News last month. “I think they’re going to all go in very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some hurdles remain in getting the crown prince on board. While he and Trump are expected to sign a defense cooperation agreement Tuesday, it falls short of the treaty under discussion in earlier phases of normalization discussions, the US official said. A formal treaty would require congressional approval.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia has also said a condition to normalizing ties with Israel is a “credible” and “irreversible” pathway to Palestinian statehood, which the Gaza plan Trump helped broker stops short of providing.\n \n\n   \n  And for Saudi Arabia, another issue is high on the agenda — the stability of Sudan, which it views as critical for its own security, believing that only Trump can stop external support for the civil war there.\n \n\n   \n  But American officials are nonetheless hopeful about making progress on the normalization issue during Tuesday’s meeting.\n \n\n   \n  One of the architects of the Abraham Accords, Trump’s son-in-law  Jared Kushner , visited Riyadh last week for talks with the crown prince ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, a White House official and a person familiar with the matter said. Kushner has long had a close, personal relationship with the Saudi prince, and has been deployed several times in recent months to use his ties to Mideast leaders to help lay the groundwork for Trump’s agenda and build upon the Abraham Accords.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the sensitive dynamic of the visit are Trump’s  personal financial interests in the region . The Trump Organization, which is being run by the president’s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is involved in major real estate projects in Saudi Arabia. Kushner also has significant business ties to the country. Kushner’s investment fund, Affinity Partners, has raised billions of dollars in capital from Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated on Monday with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/americas/venezuela-cartel-de-los-soles-fto-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"Is the US targeting a Venezuelan cartel that may not technically exist?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is proposing to designate the Cartel de los Soles—a decentralized network of Venezuelan military officials involved in drug trafficking—as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), despite experts arguing that it lacks the structure and ideology of a traditional cartel and may not technically exist.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Trump administration ramps up the pressure on Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro, experts and former government officials have raised concerns about its  move to designate Cartel de los Soles  as a foreign terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  They argue it is not a formally organized cartel similar to criminal organizations in Colombia and Mexico, and it’s a stretch to suggest Maduro leads it, though there is government involvement in the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  They suggested the designation provides the administration a justification to take military action against the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said as much on Sunday, telling reporters that the designation could allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about Cartel de los Soles\n \n\n   \n  Cartel de los Soles, which means cartel of the suns in English, is used to describe a decentralized network of Venezuelan groups within the armed forces linked to drug trafficking, say experts.\n \n\n   \n  But given its lack of hierarchy and structure, some say it can’t be compared to traditional cartels that have been designated as terror groups by the US, and others suggest it technically doesn’t exist in a conventional sense.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re designating a non-thing that is not a terror organization as a terrorist organization,” said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues.\n \n\n   \n  Another former senior US government official said Cartel de los Soles was “a made-up name used to describe an ad hoc group of Venezuelan officials involved in the trafficking of drugs through Venezuela. It doesn’t have the hierarchy or command-and-control structure of a traditional cartel.”\n \n\n   \n  The official said the Trump administration’s assertions are based on “bad intel” likely from the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny before the greater intelligence community, or that “it is purely political.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the DIA and DEA for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The name emerged in the 1990s, after Venezuelan generals and commanders – who wore sun insignias on their epaulettes – were investigated for drug trafficking and related crimes, according to the think tank  InsightCrime .\n \n\n   \n  The name caught on and was frequently used, especially from the mid-2000s onward, when several members of different branches of the military assumed more active roles in drug trafficking, InsightCrime said in a recent report.\n \n\n   \n  Jeremy McDermott, cofounder and co-director of InsightCrime, told CNN that the so-called cartel “is not a traditional, vertically organized drug trafficking organization. It is, at least according to InsightCrime, a series of normally disconnected cells embedded within the Venezuelan military.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the  State Department , Cartel de los Soles, along with the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminal organization and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, are responsible for drug trafficking to the United States and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Phil Gunson, a researcher with the International Crisis Group based in Caracas,  previously told CNN  that “Cartel de los Soles, per se, doesn’t exist. It’s a journalistic expression created to refer to the involvement of Venezuelan authorities in drug trafficking.”\n \n\n   \n  This doesn’t mean that there aren’t military personnel or government officials involved in drug trafficking. “The cartels are here, the Colombians and the Mexicans, too. There are drug shipments via the Orinoco River and by air through clandestine airstrips, flights from Apure to Central America, and so on. All of this wouldn’t be possible without direct involvement from above,” the expert said.\n \n\n   \n  For Gunson, Maduro’s role is reminiscent of that of former Panamanian President Manuel  Noriega , who was sentenced to decades in prison in various jurisdictions for his association with the Medellín cartel in 1992: an external partner who, while not directly part of a cartel, still benefited from drug trafficking routes under his protection.\n \n\n   \n  The Venezuelan president has always denied any personal involvement in drug trafficking, and his government has repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged cartel.\n \n\n   \n  “Suddenly, they (the US) dusted off something they call the Cartel de los Soles, which they have never been able to prove, because it doesn’t exist. It’s the narrative of imperialism,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said a few days ago.\n \n\n   \n  CNN contacted the Venezuelan Attorney General’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n    What is the purpose of the designation?\n \n\n   \n  The foreign terrorist organization (FTO) designation is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism designations. It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, the move could allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela, as Trump has suggested.\n \n\n   \n  The US has traditionally treated counternarcotics work as a law enforcement matter, but Trump has increasingly sought to militarize those efforts, using traditional counterterrorism tools and authorities – something that Finucane said is really a smokescreen for the operation’s true purpose: to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “The concerning aspect of this move is that it could be a prelude to military action against the Venezuelan government itself,” Finucane said, calling it another step in Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s “efforts to cloak a regime change operation in the guise of counternarcotics.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration, he said, is “inventing a fact pattern” and “creating an alternate reality” in order to be able to publicly characterize its policy toward Venezuela as a counterterrorism campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Although designating a foreign organization as a terror organization carries no legal authority for military strikes – it technically only authorizes financial and diplomatic penalties, such as the freezing of assets – the administration has nevertheless used it as a precursor to military action in the recent past. The US military has struck 22 small boats that the administration claims were manned by criminal gangs that it designated as foreign terror organizations.\n \n\n   \n  Those designations have drawn scrutiny from legal experts because some of the gangs and cartels the US has designated are motivated by profit, not ideology. Terror groups, traditionally, have been defined as groups carrying out political violence.\n \n\n   \n  Designating Cartel de los Soles, which may not even be a formal organization, takes that already-contested logic a step further. “They’re basically operating outside of the law which is why there is no limiting principle,” Finucane said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/elizabeth-warren-larry-summers-harvard-epstein","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:09:00-05:00","title":"Larry Summers says he is ‘deeply ashamed’ after new Jeffrey Epstein emails and will pause public engagements","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former Harvard president and prominent economic advisor, has expressed 'deep shame' over his long-standing personal correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which included sexist comments and romantic advice exchanges from 2013 to 2019.

Larry Summers says he is ‘deeply ashamed’ after new Jeffrey Epstein emails and will pause public engagements \n       \n  By MJ Lee, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:09 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Larry Summers said Monday night that he was “deeply ashamed” about his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, telling CNN that he would pause all public engagements as he works to “rebuild trust and repair relationships” — but the Harvard University professor added that he will continue teaching as some call for the university to sever ties with him.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said. “While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.”\n \n\n   \n  New details of Summers’ relationship with Epstein emerged last week when a House committee  released emails  showing years of personal correspondence between the two men, including Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein’s romantic advice.\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ first statement addressing the newly unveiled Epstein correspondence comes on the heels of Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling on Harvard to sever ties with Summers and putting new pressure on the elite university to hold Summers accountable for his close friendship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor and now the Democratic senior senator from Massachusetts, had said in response to a CNN inquiry that she believes Summers — Harvard’s former president and one of its most prominent faculty members — “cannot be trusted” with students given his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren told CNN. “If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein’s sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation’s politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.”\n \n\n   \n  Harvard has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Center for American Progress, the left-leaning think tank where Summers has been a senior fellow, said Monday night after Summers’ statement: “Larry Summers has announced that he is stepping away from public commitments immediately, and this includes ending his fellowship at CAP.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers served as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama’s director of the National Economic Council and has been one of the country’s most influential economic voices for decades. Warren, an economic populist, has  clashed   with Summers   over financial regulations  in the past.\n \n\n   \n  But her new call on policymakers and institutions to shun Summers represented an even sharper critique of his character.\n \n\n   \n  Summers resigned as Harvard’s president in 2006 under pressure amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He  currently serves  as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard.\n \n\n   \n  The House Oversight Committee released  tens of thousands of pages  of documents on Wednesday that it received from the Epstein estate. Included in the recent trove were numerous exchanges between Summers and Epstein between at least 2013 and 2019. Epstein  pleaded guilty  in 2008 to state charges in Florida of one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor.\n \n\n   \n  The messages show the two men frequently bantered about current events, political headlines and high-profile figures in elite orbits — everything from Iran’s nuclear policy to Donald Trump’s first-term decisions in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  At other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers’ romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice.\n \n\n   \n  In November 2018, for example, Summers seemed to forward an email from a woman to solicit Epstein’s advice on when to write back.\n \n\n   \n  “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers wrote. (He happened to ask in the same email whether Epstein believed Trump was “getting crazier” or was “steady crazy.”)\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back in part: “she’s already beginning to sound needy :) nice.”\n \n\n   \n  In March 2019, the two men exchanged multiple emails over the course of one morning, appearing to debate whether Summers should send a note to a woman of romantic interest. Summers’ continued contact with Epstein  during this period  was particularly noteworthy because the Miami Herald published just months prior an  exhaustive investigative series  detailing Epstein’s abuse of underage girls, and exposed what the paper called “the deal of a lifetime” that he negotiated in 2007 and 2008 to avoid federal charges.\n \n\n   \n  Sending a note would be “BAD FORM,” Epstein argued to Summers.\n \n\n   \n  “Why bad form. Supposed to be face to face?” Summers wrote back.\n \n\n   \n  “you care very much for this person. You might want to demonstrate that. a note does the very opposite,” Epstein wrote back, before appearing to compare the situation to Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  And in one October 2017 email to Epstein, Summers mused: “I observed that half the IQ In world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ wife, Elisa New, is a  professor emerita  of American literature at Harvard. The Wall Street Journal  previously reported  that Summers had asked Epstein to donate money to his wife’s nonprofit. The school’s student paper, The Harvard Crimson,  reported on the outrage  among some professors about the emails between Summers and Epstein. Rachel McCleary, a lecturer in the economics department, where Summers still teaches, told The Crimson his relationship with Epstein was not “just one lapse” but rather a “character flaw.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said after the release of the latest batch of Epstein files, which included numerous comments and discussions about the president, that he is  asking his attorney general , Pam Bondi, to investigate Epstein’s ties to high-profile figures and institutions. Among those Trump singled out were Summers, Clinton and JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  The Economic Club of New York announced Monday that it postponed an upcoming event featuring Summers, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The  virtual event , scheduled for Wednesday, was billed as a discussion about “the future of fiscal and monetary policy,” with Summers and an economics professor from Columbia University. But the club said in an email to registered attendees that there had been an “unavoidable change in schedule,” spurring the postponement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if the postponement was influenced by the Epstein revelations, a club spokeswoman reiterated that it was “due to an unavoidable change in schedule.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/hongkong-soccer-stadium-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"Hong Kong’s Soccer Team Surges in Popularity Amid Record Crowds at New Stadium","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hong Kong’s soccer team, ranked 148th globally, is experiencing a dramatic revival in fan engagement, with recent home matches drawing nearly 50,000 spectators at the newly opened 50,000-seat Kai Tak Sports Park.

International soccer’s 148th-best team is pulling crowds of nearly 50,000 people \n       \n  By Fred He, James Legge, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:26 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On a steamy Tuesday night in June, 42,570 Hongkongers packed into a spectacular new harborside stadium located in their city’s urban heart.\n \n\n   \n   Built on the site of a former airport , the 50,000-seat Kai Tak Sports Park was completed this March – and has been the crucible of a resurgence in support for the local team, where a red sea of fans now regularly cheers on the players.\n \n\n   \n  Ranked 148th in the world – just between Ethiopia and the Solomon Islands – Hong Kong’s soccer team has never seen home crowds of this size, with attendances even for crucial qualifiers normally under 15,000.\n \n\n   \n  But recent games have pulled in audiences more like those at top-tier international matches.\n \n\n   \n  “We never had this many fans watching the Hong Kong team,” said Shinichi Chan, the 23-year-old rising star who is a regular starter of the team. “The stadium is becoming our new home.”\n \n\n   \n  Chester Cheung was among the crowd on June 10, a day he won’t forget. That night, Hong Kong defeated India 1-0 in the Asian Cup qualifiers – a series of matches deciding which teams go to the continent’s showpiece event in Saudi Arabia in 2027. For Cheung, a core member of a Hong Kong fan group, watching the team’s debut at the brand-new stadium was “a dream come true.”\n \n\n   \n  “I cried,” said the 29-year-old, who spent two to three months preparing for the game with his organization Chisinlo, named after a Cantonese phrase meaning “crazy people”.\n \n\n   \n  Arriving three to four hours before the game, Cheung and his mates from the group prepared flags, drums, megaphones, banners, and face-painting stickers. They also helped display a huge tifo, which they had a hand in designing.\n \n\n   \n  The fans’ energy set the stage for the players.\n \n\n   \n  “Wearing the Hong Kong team jersey, walking out of the tunnel, and seeing all the fans supporting Hong Kong is such an unbelievable feeling,” recalled Chan, who played midfielder at the game against India. “It is always going to be in my mind and push me ever harder to play better football.”\n \n\n   \n  The momentum rolled into to the next home game, where more than 45,000 fans filled the stands - a new record for the team - during a 1-1 draw against Bangladesh last month.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung said the team’s debut at Kai Tak was “a very good entry point” for those who had not watched much soccer before, as many of them were attracted by social media videos of that game and decided to give the following games a try.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday, Hong Kong will face Singapore at its third home game at Kai Tak, and tickets are already sold out.\n \n\n   \n  The packed stands should come as little surprise in a city with a rich soccer tradition going back to its time as a British colony.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s first professional league was established as early as 1908, one of the oldest in Asia. It flourished in the 1970s and 80s, but since then has lost fans lured by globalized European leagues, in particular the English Premier League.\n \n\n   \n  The team’s more hardcore fans in the past have also been outspoken supporters of Hong Kong’s unique Cantonese identity, culture and language, something that has occasionally caused political frictions with local authorities. Britain handed the Asian financial hub back to China in 1997 under an agreement where it is meant to keep a level of autonomy for 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  In the years leading up to the massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019, China’s national anthem was  frequently greeted with jeers and boos  from supporters of the local team.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong authorities have since  made it illegal  to show disrespect to the national anthem, silencing the jeering in the stands as such public act of defiance could now lead to fines and lengthy imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n    New stadium\n \n\n   \n  In addition to serving as the home stadium for the city’s soccer team, the Kai Tak Sports Park is central to Hong Kong’s bid to reclaim its status as Asia’s premier destination for mega-events, after losing out to rival cities like Singapore and Tokyo in attracting some of the world’s biggest stars.\n \n\n   \n  And the progress is already noticeable. Since April, the sprawling waterfront complex has hosted performers from the rock band Coldplay to Asian pop stars JJ Lin and Jay Chou, as well as major sport events including  Rugby Sevens  and English soccer’s  North London Derby .\n \n\n   \n  But for Cheung, who has followed the Hong Kong soccer team at different home venues for 10 years, the best part about Kai Tak Sports Park is the air conditioning – not to be sniffed at in a subtropical city of swelteringly humid summers.\n \n\n   \n  “So no matter the weather, no matter how hot it is, it is still very comfortable inside, ” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Hong Kong seeing large fan-bases for teams that are far from the top of international rankings.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer across Southeast Asia has been drawing bigger crowds in recent years. Countries and regions are putting more efforts into naturalizing foreign players and cultivating young talents, which has helped boost their competitiveness on the Asian stage.\n \n\n   \n  The international nature of Hong Kong is also reflected in the team’s ethnic diversity.\n \n\n   \n  It now blends a growing group of naturalized players, including Brazil-born striker Everton Camargo and France-born winger Raphaël Merkies, with a core of local talent thriving in mainland China’s top-tier league. Chan is among them, now in his second impressive season with Shanghai Shenhua after helping the top Chinese club lift last year’s league title.\n \n\n   \n  Both fans and players are ready for the do-or-die game against Singapore Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I expect a great atmosphere, and every (fan) will spend 120% of their efforts in cheering and supporting the team,” said Cheung, who will be in the stadium with the fan group. “We are telling the fans that this time is not for entertainment. It is a fight. It’s a war.”\n \n\n   \n  For Chan and his teammates, victory is the only goal, with a spot in Saudi Arabia still up for grabs.\n \n\n   \n  “Kai Tak is giving me this feeling that we are stepping forward together as Hong Kong football, with the better venue, to play and provide better experiences for the fans,” said Chan. “And hopefully, we can create something great together.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/jesse-jackson-moved-from-icu-hospitalized","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:22:00Z","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson to be removed from the ICU but will remain hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rev.

countries \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:58 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  has yet to make a decision on whether to attack  Venezuela  on land, a White House official and a senior US official said, as he hints a window may be opening for diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Trump made clear his willingness to go after drug operations on land using military force — including, he said, in Mexico and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “We know their address. We know their address. We know everything about every one of them,” he said of drug cartel leaders, adding he would be “proud” to strike drug facilities in other countries in his attempt to prevent the substances from reaching the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs?” he said. “That’s OK with me.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Venezuela, Trump declined to rule out sending US troops, saying he doesn’t “rule out anything.”\n \n\n   \n  But as American military forces amass in the region — including the most advanced US aircraft carrier and 15,000 personnel — Trump is hoping the pressure is enough to force Maduro to step down without taking direct military action, the US official said.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah, I probably would talk to him,” Trump said Monday when asked whether he’d speak with his Venezuelan counterpart before ordering strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Potential talks between Trump and Maduro are still very preliminary, a senior White House official told CNN. Maduro and his associates have reached out through multiple channels with a desire to open a line of communication.\n \n\n   \n  Even though Trump has expressed interest in he or his administration potentially holding those talks, it was not immediately clear who might be a part of those conversations. Initially, Richard Grenell, a special presidential envoy, had been leading negotiations with top Venezuelan officials before Trump instructed him to end all diplomatic outreach last month.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s interest in potentially reopening diplomatic communications comes as the US military has continued to grow its presence near the South American country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump received briefings on military options on three consecutive days last week. The options ranged in intensity, from strikes on military or government facilities to special operations raids. The option of doing nothing also still exists.\n \n\n   \n  The president has, at points, voiced some reservations about taking direct military action inside Venezuela. He’s questioned the risks posed for US troops and asked about the likelihood of success.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is also attuned to fresh criticism from some of his allies that his attention is overly focused abroad, rather than on domestic matters.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear what signals the administration had received that Maduro was prepared for a fresh round of diplomacy. Last month, amid quiet efforts at brokering an agreement with Caracas, Trump instructed his team to cut off diplomatic outreach to Maduro and top Venezuelan officials.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Trump and senior officials were frustrated Maduro wasn’t agreeing to step down voluntarily. On Monday, David Smolansky, an advisor to Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that the mounting U.S. pressure was weakening Maduro’s hold on power.\n \n\n   \n  “They are cracking. Actually, they are cracking. And there is a lot of tensions and mistrust among themselves, not only because of the operation that is in the Caribbean,” Smolansky said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes, Katrina Samaan and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with remarks from President Donald Trump.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/mask-ban-law-enforcement-california-trump-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:37:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration sues to stop California’s law enforcement mask ban","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration filed a federal lawsuit in California challenging a new state law that bans most law enforcement officers—both local and federal—from wearing masks during official operations.

California’s ban on  most law enforcement officers from wearing masks during operations , a move the Department of Justice insisted was necessary to protect federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  In a lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California, the Trump administration argued that  California’s law,  signed in September in response to immigration raids over the summer in Los Angeles, was an unconstitutional attempt to regulate federal law enforcement officers.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes after months of immigration arrests conducted by masked federal agents who use  aggressive tactics  across the country. California’s ban was slated to go into effect in January next year.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted masks are an important precaution taken to maintain the safety of law enforcement officers. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a  press release  Monday that “they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties.”\n \n\n   \n  “California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has insisted the ban pushes back against the federal government’s use of masked agents without identification or badge numbers to detain people on the streets during immigration raids.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing,” Newsom said at a press conference when he signed the law. “Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back, and that’s what we’re doing here today.”\n \n\n   \n  The law, the first of its kind in the United States according to the Associated Press, bars neck gaiters, ski masks and other facial coverings for local and federal officers who are conducting official business. There are exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks and tactical gear. The ban does not apply to state police.\n \n\n   \n  Currently, there is no federal policy dictating when officers can or should cover their faces during arrests. Historically, officers have almost always concealed their faces only while performing undercover work to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations, law enforcement experts  have told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  The practice of hiding of agents’ faces, badges and identifying uniforms has made it difficult for members of the public to know whether the immigration arrests over the past several months are legitimate. John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, told CNN in August that it was “incredibly dangerous” for the officers to make arrests without clearly identifying themselves.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is really obvious, right? You’re sitting there and all of a sudden a bunch of masked men run out and are grabbing someone on the street,” he said on the  CNN One Thing  podcast. “There are good, well-intentioned bystanders who might think that they need to step in and help and that they’re witnessing a kidnapping.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Eric Levenson and Josh Campbell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/asia/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-verdict-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:57:00-05:00","title":"Bangladesh’s ousted leader Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death after crimes against humanity conviction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has been sentenced to death by the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) for crimes against humanity, specifically for inciting violent suppression of student protests in 2024 that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries.

      7:57 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sheikh Hasina, the ousted Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has been sentenced to death after being found guilty of crimes against humanity for the violent suppression of student protests last year that led to the collapse of her government.\n \n\n   \n  A panel of three judges from the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, delivered their verdict Monday, ruling that Hasina was responsible for inciting hundreds of extrajudicial killings carried out by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina has been staying in self-imposed exile in India’s capital New Delhi since August 2024, after student protesters forced her and the Awami League political party out of power. She was not present at the court in Dhaka.\n \n\n   \n  The former prime minister faced five charges primarily related to inciting the murder of the protestors, ordering demonstrators be hanged, and ordering the use of lethal weapons, drones and helicopters to suppress the unrest. She has long denied the charges.\n \n\n   \n  The courtroom, where some victims’ families were present, burst into applause as the judges delivered their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheikh Hasina committed crimes against humanity by her incitement, order and failure to take punitive measures,” one of the judges said as he delivered the verdict.\n \n\n   \n  It was “crystal clear” that she “expressed her incitement to the activists of her party … and furthermore, she expressed that she ordered to kill and eliminate the protesting students,” the judges said.\n \n\n   \n  For a nation still reeling from the popular revolt that ousted her, the verdict represents a stunning culmination. For many, it offers judicial validation for an uprising fueled by years of simmering anger against the creeping authoritarianism that defined her long rule.\n \n\n   \n  The verdict’s impact is also being felt in New Delhi. Bangladesh’s interim government has formally demanded the extradition of its former leader, but India has so far remained silent on the request.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi on Monday said it will “engage constructively with all stakeholders.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a close neighbour, India remains committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  What began as peaceful student demonstrations over civil service job quotas transformed into a nationwide push for Hasina’s resignation. The turning point was a government crackdown that may have killed up to 1,400 people,  according to  the UN’s human rights office (OHCHR). Up to 25,000 were also injured, the court heard.\n \n\n   \n  The UN declared the verdict on Monday as an “important moment for victims” but cautioned that rights advocates “regret the imposition of the death penalty, which we oppose in all circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  “While we were not privy to the conduct of this trial, we have consistently advocated for all accountability proceedings – especially on charges of international crimes – to unquestionably meet international standards of due process and fair trial,” OHCHR spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  Hasina slammed the “biased and politically motivated” tribunal on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement shared by her Awami League party on social media, following the verdict.\n \n\n   \n  “I reject the ICT’s other allegations of human rights abuses as equally unevidenced. I am very proud of my government’s record on human rights and development,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina ruled the South Asian nation with an iron-fist from 2009 until her ouster in 2024. Now, analysts fear the verdict on Monday could set off a wave of political chaos ahead of national elections expected in February next year.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, her lawyers submitted an appeal to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions over “serious concerns about the lack of fair trial rights and due process.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, government officials in Dhaka called on the Indian government to “hand over these two sentenced individuals to Bangladesh authorities without delay.” “This is India’s responsibility in keeping with the existing bilateral extradition treaty between both countries,” the Bangladeshi foreign ministry said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Break it down and burn it’\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of protesters descended on the crumbled residence of Hasina’s father – former Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – in Dhanmondi neighborhood, central Bangladesh, before the verdict on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Footage from local media showed demonstrators – who arrived with two bulldozers – lighting the street on fire. Some chanted, “Break it down and burn it,” referring to the Hasina family’s dynastic grip on power. Army and police forces hurled batons at them, video showed.\n \n\n   \n  Others received the verdict as a call for celebration, with students at the prestigious Dhaka University organizing a rally and distributing sweets.\n \n\n   \n  It came after violence erupted in the capital Dhaka on Sunday, with several Molotov cocktails exploding after being thrown by people on bikes, police said.\n \n\n   \n  Security had been tightened, with armored vehicles and officers with riot shields placed around the courthouse, and police, border guard and rapid action teams deployed near key government buildings.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s son on Sunday told Reuters that supporters of her party would block next year’s elections if a ban on her party was not lifted, warning that protests could become violent.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not allow elections without the Awami League to go ahead,” he said. “Our protests are going to get stronger and stronger, and we will do whatever it takes. Unless the international community does something, eventually there’s probably going to be violence in Bangladesh before these elections … there’s going to be confrontations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s political journey is a story of tragedy, exile and power, inextricably linked to the history of her home country itself. Under her stewardship, Bangladesh was ushered into an era of significant economic development albeit alongside accusations of corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and human rights abuses.\n \n\n   \n    A life in politics\n \n\n   \n  The eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh, she was thrust into politics early in life as she witnessed the struggle for Bengali autonomy from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  Following a 1975 military coup in which her father, mother, and three brothers were assassinated, Hasina and her sister were forced into exile. She returned to Bangladesh in 1981 to lead her father’s Awami League, and after years of political opposition, first became Prime Minister when the party won the 1996 election.\n \n\n   \n  She served for one term and later returned to power in 2008, ruling Bangladesh with her Awami League until last year.\n \n\n   \n  Bangladesh had seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but human rights organizations warned that she and her government were headed toward a one-party system. Critics expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, voter intimidation, and harassment of the media and opposition figures.\n \n\n   \n  During her time in power, rights groups say the government used its cyber security law to crack down on freedom of expression online, arresting journalists, artists and activists, with reported cases of arbitrary detention and torture.\n \n\n   \n  But Hasina managed to weather many previous protests against her rule.\n \n\n   \n  That changed last year with the successful Gen Z-led revolution that toppled her.\n \n\n   \n  Many of her family members, along with prominent party leaders and former ministers from her administration have also fled Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of Hasina dismiss the legal proceedings as politically motivated and designed to remove her from the political arena. The Awami League party has been banned from political activities while the trials against Hasina and party leaders continues.\n \n\n   \n  The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, asserts that these trials are an essential step toward restoring accountability and rebuilding public trust in the nation’s democratic institutions.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/john-beam-coach-shooting-cedric-irving-jr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:22:00Z","title":"Man Charged with Murder in Shooting of Oakland Football Coach and 'Last Chance U' Star John Beam","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 27-year-old man, Cedric Irving, has been charged with the murder of John Beam, a celebrated former football coach and athletic director at Laney College in Oakland.

death of celebrated former football coach John Beam, who  died Friday after being shot  in the head on the junior college campus in Oakland where he worked.\n \n\n   \n  Cedric Irving faces 50 years to life if convicted, said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson at a Monday press conference. Irving also faces enhancement charges alleging he personally fired a gun that caused great bodily injury and that the victim was particularly vulnerable, possibly due to age, according to the charging complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Beam, 66, was a giant in the local community, a father figure who forged deep relationships with his players while fielding a team that regularly competed for championships. The Netflix docuseries “Last Chance U” focused on Beam and the Laney Eagles in its 2020 season. He’d most recently been serving as the school’s athletic director after retiring from coaching last year.\n \n\n   \n  “He really is the best of Oakland — was the best of Oakland,” Jones Dickson said. “His spirit is still here.”\n \n\n   \n  The district attorney said Irving had no criminal record. He is being held without bail, and is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday. The Alameda County Public Defender’s Office said it has not been appointed to represent Irving and declined comment.\n \n\n   \n  Back-to-back shootings at two schools last week have roiled Oakland, a city of roughly 400,000 across the bay from San Francisco. On Wednesday, a student was shot at Oakland’s Skyline High School. The student is in stable condition and two juveniles were in custody.\n \n\n   \n  Jones Dickson said Skyline students were on a field trip at Laney College and had to suffer through two lockdowns in the same week. She said it was time to bring accountability into the debate over gun violence because too many young people are being hurt by easy access to firearms.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s unacceptable that we have children in our community who now this is the norm. Two days in a row that they’re locked down for gun violence on a campus. I’m not good with that,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers arrived at Laney College before noon Thursday to find Beam shot in the head at the athletics field house. He was treated at a hospital, but died the following day from his injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Irving was arrested at a commuter rail station just after 3 a.m. Friday. He was carrying the firearm used to shoot Beam, and he admitted to carrying out the shooting, according to the probable cause document.\n \n\n   \n  Oakland Assistant Chief James Beere said the suspect went on campus for a “specific reason” but did not elaborate. “This was a very targeted incident,” he said at a Friday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Beere did not say how the two men knew each other but said the Irving was known to hang around the Laney campus. Irving’s brother told the San Francisco Chronicle that Irving had lost his job as a security guard after an altercation and was facing eviction at home.\n \n\n   \n  Beam joined Laney College in 2004 as a running backs coach and became head coach in 2012, winning two league titles. According to his biography on the college’s website, at least 20 of his players went on to the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  Beam previously worked at Skyline High School, where Irving had played football but after Beam had left for another job.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/us-gaza-israel-un-vote-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:14:00-05:00","title":"UN Security Council approves U.S.-backed plan for Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Security Council passed a 13-to-0 resolution, with abstentions from Russia and China, endorsing a U.S.-backed plan for Gaza that includes establishing a Board of Peace and a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF).

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The UN Security Council passed a  US-drafted resolution  Monday that aims to move beyond the fragile truce in Gaza to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  The 15-member council voted 13 to 0 in favor of the resolution, with abstentions by Russia and China, which declined to use their veto power to block the measure.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution was intended to add international legitimacy to US President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza plan , parts of which formed the basis of the ceasefire that took effect in the Gaza Strip last month. The United States had lobbied hard for its passage, which was praised by Trump in a lengthy post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,” Trump wrote Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution authorized elements of the plan, including the establishment of the “Board of Peace” as a transitional authority and the creation of a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, according to a draft seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday that “the members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.”   \n \n\n   \n  Some diplomatic sources said the resolution will help grant the authority for countries to participate in the ISF, as it will now have UN backing.\n \n\n   \n  US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said Monday that the ISF, “a strong coalition of peacekeepers, many from Muslim majority nations like Indonesia, Azerbaijan and others,” will deploy to Gaza “under a unified command” in order to “secure Gaza streets … oversee demilitarization … protect civilians and … escort aid through safe corridors.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had acknowledged the need for an “international mandate” to support the plan. Ahead of the vote, Waltz warned that “a vote against this resolution is a vote to return to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the resolution has passed, many questions remain about its implementation, with the draft appearing vague on sequencing and detail.\n \n\n   \n  Western diplomatic sources have told CNN that the lack of detail in the resolution will make it hard to put into effect. It has faced scutiny for lacking a clear timeline for the transitional authorities to hand over to the Palestinian Authority, saying only that it will do so once the PA “has satisfactorily completed its reform program.” The resolution authorizes the Board of Peace and other authorized “international civil and security presences” until the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution states that the Board of Peace will oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other factions – a key Israeli demand – and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the resolution also contains a reference to Palestinian statehood, but it provides no timeline for it.\n \n\n   \n  “After the (Palestinian Authority) reform program is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft said.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The representative from Russia, one of the two UN Security Council members to abstain from the vote, said it was important that the resolution not become “a death knell for the two state solution.” A representative of China, the other member to abstain, argued that “it seems Palestine is barely visible in it, and the Palestinian sovereignty and ownership are not fully reflected.”\n \n\n   \n  The resolution calls on UN member states and international oragnizations to work with the Board “to contribute personnel, equipment, and financial resources to its operating entities and the ISF, to provide technical assistance to its operating entities and the ISF, and to give full recognition to its acts and documents.”\n \n\n   \n   Hamas said Sunday that it considered the draft resolution “an attempt to impose international guardianship over Gaza and promote a vision biased toward the occupation.”\n \n\n   \n  After Monday’s vote, Hamas said that giving any stabilization force “tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality and turns it into a party to the conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz said after the passage of the resolution that the Board of Peace “will coordinate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, facilitate Gaza’s development and support a technocratic committee of Palestinians responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza civil service and administration while the Palestinian Authority fully implements its reform program.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have not expanded in detail on what that reform program would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Some Hamas officials continue to rule out disarmament of the group’s military wing. Hamas fighters would be reluctant to give up light weapons to protect themselves from other groups in Gaza seeking retribution.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Sunday that “Gaza will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed — either the easy way or the hard way.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tim Lister, Nic Robertson and Eyad Kourdi contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/world/parasocial-cambridge-dictionary-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:01:00-05:00","title":"Cambridge Dictionary’s 2025 word of the year captures an ‘unhealthy’ modern phenomenon","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cambridge Dictionary has named 'parasocial' as its Word of the Year for 2025, capturing the growing trend of one-sided emotional connections people form with strangers, including celebrities and artificial intelligence.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Cambridge Dictionary  has named its  word of the year  for 2025, alighting on “ parasocial ,” used to describe a connection that people feel with someone they don’t know – or even with an artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The term was coined in 1956 by sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl, who wanted to describe how television viewers formed “para-social” relationships with TV personalities, the dictionary said in a statement published Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  This phenomenon continues today, as social media users form parasocial relationships with celebrities, influencers and online personalities with whom they have no personal connection.\n \n\n   \n  A key example cited by Cambridge Dictionary is singer Taylor Swift, who announced her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce this year, with many fans talking of their heartfelt feelings toward a couple that the vast majority had never met.\n \n\n   \n  Another is British singer Lily Allen, whose latest album “West End Girl” tells the story of a breakup and sparked a “parasocial interest in her love life,” according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  And use of the term has surged this year, particularly as concerns over the connections that some people have started to develop with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have come to the fore.\n \n\n   \n  Colin McIntosh, a lexicographer at the Cambridge Dictionary, said the word “captures the 2025 zeitgeist” and demonstrates how language changes.\n \n\n   \n  “What was once a specialist academic term has become mainstream,” he said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,” McIntosh added.\n \n\n   \n  “The language around parasocial phenomena is evolving fast, as technology, society and culture shift and mutate: from celebrities to chatbots, parasocial trends are fascinating for those who are interested in the development of language,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Simone Schnall, Professor of Experimental Social Psychology at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement that the word “is an inspired choice.”\n \n\n   \n  “The rise of parasocial relationships has redefined fandom, celebrity and, with AI, how ordinary people interact online,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,” Schnall added.\n \n\n   \n  “This leads to a sense that people ‘know’ those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme

says charges against her stem from ‘illegal and unethical behavior’ by Trump administration \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:12 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James says the Trump administration engaged in “outrageous” conduct to overcome hurdles to bring the mortgage fraud case against her and urged a judge to throw out the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers point to the collective actions of President Donald Trump; Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who made the criminal referral to the Justice Department; Attorney General Pam Bondi;  Lindsey Halligan , the US attorney who brought the case; and Ed Martin, the special attorney in charge of mortgage fraud cases.\n \n\n   \n  “This indictment is the product of months of illegal and unethical behavior by government officials, only made possible by the misuse of a federal agency, the disregard of exculpatory evidence, the systematic removal of ethics officials and career prosecutors who stood in the way, and the improper attempt to install an unqualified U.S. Attorney with nothing to offer except undying loyalty,” lawyers for James  wrote in a motion Monday  to dismiss the case.\n \n\n   \n  “If this brazen, continuous disregard for the law and the Constitution is not outrageous government conduct, nothing is,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The motion, which is a long shot, is one of several legal maneuvers James’ lawyers have launched to try to get the charges dismissed. The indictment alleges she misled a lender when she obtained a mortgage in 2020 on a property in Norfolk, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  James  has previously argued  the charges should be thrown out on the basis that the case is the result of vindictive and selective prosecution and that Halligan is serving unlawfully as US attorney. She is also asking the judge to provide her with material from the grand jury presentation, including whether any exculpatory evidence was presented. Prosecutors have not yet responded to the filings.\n \n\n   \n  James has  pleaded not guilty , and a trial is scheduled for January.\n \n\n   \n  In the latest filing, James’ lawyers raised questions about the source of material for Pulte’s referral, suggesting he may have improperly accessed loan files from Fannie Mae’s database. Citing media reports, the lawyers say Pulte fired officials from the FHFA inspector general’s office who were looking into whether he followed internal procedures.\n \n\n   \n  They also highlighted internal messages between investigators at Fannie Mae to support their claim. In one message, dated June 13, 2025, the Fannie Mae director of mortgage fraud investigations told an associate: “the LJ case is certainly not clear and convincing evidence” of fraud,” according to the court filing. The associate responds, “director asking how we know that the [niece] has lived there since oct 2020,” which James’ lawyers say is “clearly demonstrating Director Pulte’s intimate and direct involvement in the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  James is accused of falsely stating she would use the property as a second home. Prosecutors allege she rented out the property and benefited from lower interest rates by receiving a mortgage for a second home instead of an investment property. People familiar with the arrangement say James’ grandniece has lived in the property since it was purchased and has never paid rent.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte, James’ lawyers’ argued, played a hands-on role and sent additional information, including a financial calculation of interest rate differences, to Martin and Halligan, who was named US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after  her predecessor refused  to bring a case against James.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Pulte, James’ lawyers say Martin’s conduct violated professional rules and DOJ policy by suggesting if James resigned the investigation would be dropped. They also said when Martin  posed for photos  outside of James’ Brooklyn home, it was an act of intimidation.\n \n\n   \n  “The charges she now faces are inextricably linked to the government’s illegal and unethical investigatory techniques,” James’ lawyers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge doesn’t dismiss the indictment, James’ lawyers are asking for additional communication between Trump, Bondi, Halligan, Martin and Pulte, as well as their staff.\n \n\n   \n  Based on some information they have already received, her lawyers wrote, “over 100 pages of discovery likely turned over by the former FHFA acting inspector general has not been produced.”\n \n\n   \n    Asks for grand jury records\n \n\n   \n  James’ team on Monday also asked the court to order prosecutors to  turn over documents related to the grand jury  in Alexandria, Virginia, that approved the charges against her in October, as well as one empaneled in Norfolk this summer as the Justice Department was investigating her.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan ultimately asked only the Alexandria grand jury to vote on the charges, something James’ attorneys described as a “unique set of circumstances” that warranted their right to sift through a trove of documents they don’t have access to in order to “assess whether the grand jury that brought the indictment was selected, presented to and instructed properly.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the materials James’ team wants access to are documents concerning how the jurors in Alexandria were screened, statements Halligan made to the jurors in Alexandria, and whether certain information provided to the Norfolk grand jury — including potentially exculpatory facts — was also given to the jurors who were asked to vote on the charges.\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the investigation has said James’ grandniece testified before the Norfolk grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “The need for disclosing the narrow set of grand jury materials being requested is high,” James’ lawyers wrote in court papers, acknowledging the fact that the documents sought are ordinarily kept under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  A similar fight over grand jury records in James Comey’s criminal case has been underway in recent weeks. A judge has ordered prosecutors in the former FBI director’s case to hand over all grand jury materials to Comey’s team, but the government is trying to stop that decision.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-trump-pulte-mortgage-fraud-lowell","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:20:00Z","title":"Federal Reserve Governor says Trump ally ‘cherry-picked’ details to make mortgage fraud claim","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is under investigation for mortgage fraud after a referral from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleged she misrepresented multiple properties as primary residences.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said allegations she committed mortgage fraud are “baseless” and urged the Justice Department to drop its inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department  indicated this summer  it would review Cook’s mortgages after receiving a referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleging she engaged in mortgage fraud by claiming multiple properties were primary residences. President Donald Trump used the allegations as a basis to try to fire Cook. She sued to keep her job and the Supreme Court is  expected to decide   the case next year.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Monday to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Ed Martin , special attorney for mortgage fraud, and obtained by CNN, Cook’s lawyer Abbe Lowell said the records indicate Cook’s applications were accurate.\n \n\n   \n  “The full record makes clear that what he claims to be contradictions in loan applications were not contradictions at all but were cherry-picked, incomplete snippets of the full documents submitted at the time and in subsequent filings by Governor Cook consistent with her applications. The referrals are baseless and should not have been made in the first place,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte, who has made referrals to DOJ involving allegations of mortgage fraud against prominent Democrats, highlighted three properties Cook owns in Massachusetts, Georgia and Michigan. He alleged Cook improperly claimed they were primary residences in documents seeking mortgages, which her attorney denied.\n \n\n   \n  In the 54-page letter, including dozens of pages of exhibits, Lowell wrote that Cook took out mortgages on homes as primary residences because that is where she lived at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Cook had different principal residences over the years because her distinguished career had taken her to academic posts at Harvard University and Michigan State University, a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, and a government post at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in Washington, D.C. This reflects why different mortgage applications accurately reported different properties as her primary residence at different periods of time,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell conceded “an inadvertent notation” in a document related to a condo she purchased in Atlanta in 2021 that said the condo is a primary residence. Lowell said another loan document in the application stated the condo is a “vacation home.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because Governor Cook submitted that document to the lender as well, it would be impossible to conclude that she intended to defraud the lender by inadvertently listing the property as her ‘Primary Residence’ elsewhere,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell said Cook bought her first home in 2002 in Cambridge and it was her primary residence until she accepted an assistant professor position at Michigan State University and bought the property there in 2005. When Cook later refinanced the Cambridge home, Lowell said, she updated the paperwork to reflect it was no longer her primary residence.\n \n\n   \n  Cook has lived on and off at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, home since 2005, Lowell said. When she refinanced the mortgage in 2021, he said, it was still her primary residence because she was still employed at the school.\n \n\n   \n  Cook became a Federal Reserve governor in 2022. Lowell said she obtained permits to rent the property in Michigan until she returns when her term in Washington, DC, is up. He cites a city official as stating that living elsewhere on a temporary basis “does not necessarily make an owner ineligible for a principal residence exemption.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,” Lowell wrote in the letter.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell also represents New York Attorney General Letitia James in a criminal case on similar mortgage fraud claims initiated by Pulte.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  “The Department of Justice does not comment on current or prospective litigation including matters that may be an investigation,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with a response from the Justice Department. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/soccer-trump-world-cup-host-cities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump Muses About Moving World Cup Games From Host Cities Amid Security Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has voiced a potential threat to relocate World Cup matches from U.S. host cities, particularly those led by Democratic officials, citing concerns over crime and lack of cooperation.

Trump issued a veiled threat to Democratic-run cities slated to host  World Cup  matches next year, saying he might ask FIFA to move games from certain cities if he feels crime is too high or local leadership isn’t cooperating with the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking in the Oval Office with FIFA president  Gianni Infantino  by his side, Trump was asked what it would take for World Cup games to be taken away from host cities, as he has previously threatened.\n \n\n   \n  “The governors are going to have to behave. The mayors are going to have to behave,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “In the case of California, you have a problem. You have high crime and you have a place that just suffered great fires and everything else, and they didn’t do a very good job. … So, here’s the story. I love Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in the National Guard or whoever is necessary to help them. I want it to be great. I’d love it to be in Los Angeles. I love the place. It’s a natural for Los Angeles.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “If we think there’s going to be crime, if we are obstructed by the governor – and maybe he won’t obstruct, maybe it’ll be great. But I’d love for him to call and say, ‘You know, we’d like to have some extra (help)’ because if there’s even a hint of a problem, we want to get in there before the problem occurs.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump last month threatened to pull World Cup games  from Boston after mentioning his displeasure  with that city’s Democratic mayor, Michelle Wu.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for specifics on Monday about what it would take for him to try and move matches from host cities, Trump was vague.\n \n\n   \n  “If we think there’s going to be any sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city,” he said. “We have a lot of cities that would love to have it, No. 1, and we’ll do it very safely.”\n \n\n   \n  Reporters asked the president about his threats to pull games and – in an extraordinary moment – turned to Infantino, saying, “But if we think there’s going to be a problem, Gianni, can I say we will move?”\n \n\n   \n  The FIFA president, who has developed a tight relationship with Trump in recent years, declined to enthusiastically back the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “Safety and security is the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup,” Infantino said in response to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see today that people have trust in the United States. … They know that they will be coming here, and they will experience a safe and secure World Cup.

While they’re nominally meant to crack down on illegal immigration, reports have circulated of US citizens being caught up in federal operations and many community activists have expressed displeasure with the unrequested help.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said his preference would be that Democratic leaders of 2026 World Cup host cities simply invite the National Guard into their cities now.\n \n\n   \n  “If they would tell us now, they’re not gonna have a problem,” Trump said. “Because if we go in, they don’t have a problem.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine-gavi-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"US Funding Cuts Imperil Global Efforts to Eliminate Cervical Cancer","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The global effort to eliminate cervical cancer—driven by HPV vaccination campaigns led by Gavi—is now under serious threat due to unexpected funding cuts from the United States.

She was one of the 349,000 women globally who die from the preventable cancer every year. Thirteen years later, he jumped at the chance to protect his family and community from undergoing such loss again.\n \n\n   \n  In May 2024, Modu helped launch Borno’s first immunization campaign to vaccinate adolescent girls against human papillomavirus (HPV), the pathogen that causes nearly all cervical cancers. And he made sure two of his daughters, including the youngest child of his late wife, were among the first to be protected.\n \n\n   \n  “More than any other person, I was so excited when I heard about the vaccine,” said Modu, who has 10 children.\n \n\n   \n  “I was so happy that they were safe,” he said. “It reminds me of the lost glory of my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  His daughters were among 86 million girls vaccinated as part of a campaign led by Gavi, a public-private partnership that works with government health systems in lower-income countries to protect children and adolescents against   more than 20 infectious diseases. Seventy-three million of those girls were vaccinated in just the past three years, most of them in Africa and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Its HPV vaccination program is a key piece of the World Health Organization’s  global strategy  to put cervical cancer on a path to elimination, following diseases like measles, polio and smallpox. But the pace of its progress against HPV and cervical cancer is now under threat after unexpected funding cuts by the US government.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi set an ambitious target to dramatically scale up its HPV vaccine program in 2023. On Monday, the organization announced that it had met its goals.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanks to incredible commitment from countries, partners, civil society and communities, we have now reached that target ahead of schedule,” said Dr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s CEO. “This collaborative effort is driving major global progress towards eliminating one of the deadliest diseases affecting women.”\n \n\n   \n  But the celebration is taking place under a heavy shadow. In June, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stunned health officials when, in a video address to world leaders gathered to pledge funding to Gavi, he said the US was pulling all financial support until the organization could “re-earn the public’s trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who has repeatedly  targeted the US vaccine system  since taking office, praised Gavi’s commitment to “making medicine affordable to all the world’s people” but criticized   its messaging about vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Gavi’s handling of vaccine safety issues.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi issued a  detailed statement  in response to Kennedy’s claims, defending its commitment to children’s health and use of independent WHO experts, noting that it “remains committed to continuing an evidence-based and scientific approach to its work and investment decisions, as it always has done.” It has continued to engage with the US government on restoring funding in the months since, a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi’s budget comes from national governments and private funders, including philanthropies, corporations and individual donors, with the US having been – until recently – one of its largest supporters. Since its founding in 2000, the organization has helped immunize over 1.2 billion children in 78 lower-income countries, efforts that have prevented an estimated 20.6 million deaths.\n \n\n   \n  No country had ever withdrawn a financial commitment to Gavi, according to the organization. The US provided about 13% of its funding. If that isn’t restored, combined with other reduced pledges, Gavi will be left with a nearly $3 billion shortfall – approximately a quarter of its expected budget. That could force a significant scaling back of the anti-cancer campaign when Gavi’s board meets next month.\n \n\n   \n  HPV vaccination remains a top priority for Gavi, a spokesperson said, but financial pressure might affect how it expands coverage. “Difficult decisions will need to be made on deploying resources to areas of highest health impact.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about its stance on Gavi, HHS referred to its statement issued when Kennedy announced the pause in funding, which said “the concern is that when vaccine safety issues have come before GAVI, it has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency did not address questions about what specifically   Gavi can do to re-earn public trust in the eyes of the US government.\n \n\n   \n  The millions of HPV vaccines Gavi has given will save lives, said Dr. Robert Bednarczyk, an associate professor of global health at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. “But there’s going to be new children and adolescents that are going to be eligible to get vaccinated every year. And having cuts to Gavi’s support is potentially going to reduce the access to vaccines in these settings.”\n \n\n   \n    A cancer-preventing vaccine\n \n\n   \n  HPV vaccines protect against a family of viruses that cause 4% of cancers globally, the most common of which is cervical cancer, the fourth deadliest cancer for women. Depending on the formulation of the vaccine, they prevent infections that cause between 70% and 90% of all cervical cancer cases.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a remarkable vaccine,” said Dr. Jessica Kahn, professor of pediatrics and senior associate dean of clinical and translational research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who noted that it also prevents infections that cause anal, vaginal, vulvar, and head and neck cancers. “It has the potential to have a truly transformative impact on cancers around the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Introduced in 2006, the vaccine is only the second widely used vaccine that prevents cancer; the other prevents hepatitis B infections, a major cause of liver cancer. The HPV vaccine is typically given before the beginning of sexual activity, generally recommended for girls ages 9 to 14 in a two- or three-dose regimen. Its dramatic impact is becoming more obvious as the first women to receive the vaccine reach their 30s, 40s and 50s, when cervical cancer typically appears.\n \n\n   \n  “The HPV vaccine is probably one of the most effective vaccines that we have out there, and we’re constantly getting new data in on that, as the vaccine has been used for a longer period of time,” said Bednarczyk, who studies HPV vaccination. “The research really shows us that we have a very, very good tool for reducing the amount of cervical cancer and really decreasing that burden globally.”\n \n\n   \n  But for years, the vaccine was mostly available in wealthy countries, such as the United States and European nations. Further decreasing the cervical cancer burden means vaccinating school-age girls in places where cases and deaths are highest: low- and middle-income countries, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. That requires a lot of investment, Bednarczyk says. “HPV vaccines are some of the more expensive vaccines that we have out there. That’s really where Gavi comes in.”\n \n\n   \n  In the 2010s, Gavi began piloting school-based vaccination programs. But demand soon outpaced HPV vaccine supply, leading to shortages. The organization spent years negotiating purchasing agreements with vaccine manufacturers on behalf of the 57 lower-income countries it supports.\n \n\n   \n  All the pieces were in place at the end of 2022, when a big opportunity arose to reduce cost and simplify the HPV vaccination process: WHO issued guidance that said a single dose of the vaccine confers effective protection. Gavi was ready, said Emily Kobayashi, head of Gavi’s HPV Vaccines Programme.\n \n\n   \n  “That single-dose recommendation from WHO, based on the building evidence, meant that the supply we had could go much further,” she said. “And it was easier to deliver the vaccine to girls once, rather than having to track them down and give them their second or third dose.”\n \n\n   \n  Gavi quickly directed $600 million to the “revitalisation” of its HPV vaccination program, supporting countries on vaccine acquisition, investments in health systems to improve HPV vaccine delivery, and integrating HPV vaccination into routine immunisation. In 2023 alone, it helped vaccinate 14 million girls – more than in the previous eight years combined.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Game-changer’\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria, Modu’s home, was one of the first countries to launch a single-dose HPV immunization program with Gavi. The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria has a cervical cancer rate that’s four times higher than in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “I was amazed when the federal government announced the introduction of HPV into immunization,” Modu said. “I mobilized my community together – my family and everybody to receive this vaccination.”\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, the country has immunized more than 13 million girls, the largest share of Gavi’s 86 million total. Nigeria is among 49 countries that have introduced HPV vaccination with Gavi support. Another seven are on track to launch programs before mid-2026, according to the organization, some of them before the end of 2025.\n \n\n   \n  By January, Gavi estimates that HPV vaccines will be available in countries that have 89% of the world’s cervical cancer burden, up from 10% a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  “This is definitely a game-changer for HPV vaccination and access to the HPV vaccine,” Kobayashi said. “Cervical cancer is one of the most painful and undignified ways to die, and it’s almost completely preventable by one shot in childhood. … It’s going from a vaccine that’s only available in a small number of places to something that’s widely available, including in lower-income countries.”\n \n\n   \n  Gavi’s current plans call for more than doubling the number of girls it has vaccinated against HPV in the next five years and continuing to expand access to more countries with high rates of cervical cancer. The goal is to vaccinate 120 million girls from 2026 to   2030. The organization spent the past year appealing to donors to fully fund its campaign to do so, which it estimates would save 1.5 million lives.\n \n\n   \n    Paused\n \n\n   \n  But in the wake of Kennedy’s stunning announcement, these ambitious goals are now in question.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi plans its work on five-year cycles, securing pledges from its major funders in advance. Since the organization was founded, the US has been among the largest funders, exceeded only by the United Kingdom and the Gates Foundation. During the Biden administration, it pledged $1.58 billion to Gavi for 2025-30, what was set to be its largest contribution yet.\n \n\n   \n  US commitments to Gavi were uninterrupted during the first Trump administration, with Trump recommitting the US pledge in 2020, but things were different almost immediately when the new administration began this year. Funding for Gavi was  abruptly paused  during the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development and remains in limbo.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to engage with the U.S. and hope we can sustain the strong partnership that has endured since Gavi’s founding,” the Gavi spokesperson said. “While we have incredible bipartisan support in Congress and across U.S. Administrations, including President Trump’s robust pledge at the 2020 replenishment, this is the first time we’ve seen a committed pledge walked back.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the executive branch makes the country’s financial pledges to the organization, it’s Congress that sets the annual funding level to be distributed to Gavi. For the 2026 fiscal year, a House committee approved $300 million for Gavi, while its Senate counterpart has not yet released a State and Foreign appropriations bill. Meanwhile, Gavi has not received the $300 million Congress appropriated in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in September.\n \n\n   \n  In a response to questions about who would make the ultimate decision about releasing allocated funds, a State Department spokesperson said in an email, “The U.S. government speaks with one voice for all America First foreign policy programming,” adding that “The State Department collaborates closely with [other agencies] to implement assistance consistent with Trump Administration priorities. … The State Department has notified Gavi that the American taxpayer’s money must deliver better on the United States’ global health goals.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s announcement came on the heels of other Trump administration shakeups pulling back from global health initiatives, including  withdrawing from WHO  and dismantling the  US Agency for International Development .\n \n\n   \n  As those shakeups reverberated across the global health field, Gavi saw other funders partially scale back expected contributions. And vaccine experts worry that US actions will not just limit budgets but erode trust in vaccines as well.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s long history of criticizing vaccine programs – often with false and misleading claims – includes helping organize  a lawsuit  against the makers of Gardasil, the first HPV vaccine, alleging that drugmaker   Merck overstated its safety (Merck has previously said the litigation has no merit). The potential fees Kennedy would collect from the case while in office became a point of contention in his confirmation hearing, before he ultimately said he would  divest from the case.  The next month, the parties agreed to  postpone the case  until February 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate legal action in March, a federal judge ruled in Merck’s favor, dismissing more than 200 cases that similarly challenged the safety of the vaccine.\n \n\n   \n  “There are headwinds there because of vaccine disinformation and misinformation,” said Kahn, who has served on the WHO HPV Vaccine Advisory Committee and has been studying HPV vaccine effectiveness since 2006. “But this is one of the safest vaccines ever tested,” she said, citing more than 100 safety studies of 2.5 million people in six countries, which have shown no serious side effects of HPV vaccination beyond the rare allergic reactions typical for all vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  “If we wanted to eliminate cervical cancer globally, we could,” said Kahn, who considers the WHO cervical cancer goals ambitious but “achievable with the right political will.”\n \n\n   \n  Those goals set a target of 90% of girls under 15 vaccinated against HPV by 2030, along with screening and treatment targets for adult women.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got these tools, we’ve got these systems to be able to prevent these cancers, but we actually need to be able to use them. And to use them, we need these concerted efforts to make sure that there is good and equitable access to these vaccines,” Bednarczyk said. “So all of these missed opportunities that we have today due to these funding cuts are potentially leaving generations of individuals more susceptible to these cancers.”\n \n\n   \n  A few countries, including the Netherlands, Brazil and Hungary, have increased financial commitments to Gavi in recent months, and the organization expects to announce several others by the end of the year. But those contributions so far total less than $200 million of the nearly $3 billion budget hole. Gavi’s leadership will be making decisions on how to use the funding it does have at a board meeting in December and finalizing them by the summer.\n \n\n   \n  “Our leadership and Board are looking at ways in which cuts can be applied to Gavi programmes while having as little impact as possible on children’s health. At the same time, Gavi continues to fundraise,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The organization will continue to support countries in the process of launching HPV vaccination programs, some using remaining 2025 funds, and those now doing routine HPV vaccination, like Nigeria. As girls there reach their 9th birthdays, they’ll be able to get Gavi-supplied vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Those include two more of Maina Modu’s children. Modu retired from his immunization officer job last month at age 56 but continues to campaign for cervical cancer vaccination, sharing his family’s story to encourage members of his community to vaccinate their daughters.\n \n\n   \n  “Cervical cancer is a very dangerous and killer disease, and I learned that from my late wife,” he said. “That’s what makes me take it upon myself to make sure that I immunize them and ask others to emulate this.”\n \n\n   \n  Another of Maina Modu’s daughters turns 9 in January. He plans to take her straight to their local health clinic for her HPV vaccine.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/style/met-gala-2026-theme","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:11:00-04:00","title":"Met Museum unveils 2026 Met Gala theme: ‘Costume Art’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced the 2026 Met Gala theme as 'Costume Art,' aiming to establish a deeper connection between fashion and fine art by showcasing nearly 200 garments alongside artworks in a new 12,000-square-foot exhibition space.

\nUpdated: \n        6:11 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What’s the best dressed painting of all time?\n \n\n   \n  It’s a question the Metropolitan Museum of Art hopes to answer with its next Costume Institute exhibition, which it revealed on Monday morning will be   “Costume Art.” Opening May 10, the showcase will pair almost 200 artworks with around 200 garments and accessories in an effort to join the dots between fashion and fine art once and for all. “Costume Art” is also the show that will animate what is arguably fashion’s splashiest, starriest night: the Met Gala.\n \n\n   \n  “The title ‘Costume Art’ refers to the history of the Costume I﻿nstitute,” said Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s curator, who selects each year’s theme, at a press conference. Fashion, he explained, has “the status of art because of, and not in spite of, its relation to the body.”\n \n\n   \n  While fashion exhibitions at museums tend to divorce a garment from its life on the human form, here the Met will emphasize that connection as the quality that puts clothing on the same pedestal as a Greek statue or Albrecht Dürer engraving.\n \n\n   \n  Recently retired ballerina Misty Copeland was on hand to explain how Bolton plans to use garments and artworks to push against the notion of an idealized body: “What struck me most was his belief in fashion as an embodied art. Something deeply connected to who we are,” Copeland said. “The show makes a powerful case for the body in all its forms as a work of art, worthy of being seen, elevated and celebrated.”\n \n\n   \n  While the theme may strike some as sleepy — “fashion is art!” is well-trodden territory — it is the space, not the show’s theme, that may be the biggest news. Twelve-thousand square-feet of exhibition space will be newly dedicated to the Costume Institute, just off the museum’s Great Hall. “It really recognizes the central role of fashion not just within the Met, but within culture,” Bolton told CNN after the the press conference.\n \n\n   \n  The galleries carry an august name: Condé M. Nast, the late founder of the business that publishes Vogue, the style bible synonymous with the Met Gala, as well as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and GQ. The new space was made possible via a donation of an undisclosed size from the company. That will likely raise eyebrows: Condé Nast is in the news more frequently for its fading fortunes and disagreements with its union, than its financial wins.\n \n\n   \n  Also in attendance was Anna Wintour (sat next to Michael Kors), who earlier this year  relinquished her title as Vogue US’s editor-in-chief  but remains as Vogue’s global editorial director, as well as chief content officer for Condé Nast, meaning she retains her position supervising the annual Met Gala, which she transformed from a quiet society event into a global spectacle of celebrity and high octane fashion.\n \n\n   \n  The fashion sponsor is the French luxury label Saint Laurent, along with Condé Nast and, in another surprising fashion play, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos. Typically, the sponsoring brand will bring a few tables’ full of guests, all dressed in their clothes. Bezos and Sánchez Bezos’s financial support marks the couple’s latest move in their quest to evolve from mere cartoon zillionaires to style cognoscenti: In addition to attending the gala in 2024 and posing for the cover of Vogue US,  Sánchez’s Earth Fund recently announced a $6.25 million partnership with the CFDA to promote sustainability in fashion .\n \n\n   \n  The Met Gala, and its less influential though no less opulent exhibition, has become a red carpet machine that is arguably more anticipated and dissected than the Oscars. In a good year, the show and gala inspire the public to think more critically about the purpose and possibility of clothes. Designers jockey for months to dress stars like Rihanna, Zendaya and supermodels in boundary-pushing designs. Some of the museum’s most influential exhibitions, like  2019’s Camp-themed show , or 2011’s tribute to the late Alexander McQueen, have played a hand in making streetstyle and red carpets more outrageous or convincing the public that fashion is a craft on the level of fine art. With its upcoming exhibition and new space, Bolton and the museum are clearly keen to ensure that no one forgets fashion can demand the effort and genius required of a Renaissance masterpiece.\n \n\n   \n  At other times, confusing or milquetoast themes have made the event feel out of touch.  2024’s “Sleeping Beauties,”  which used AI to celebrate the fragility and transient nature of fashion, was too riddled by gimmicky scientific ambitions to illuminate its gowns and flower-trimmed hats, and  the previous year’s tribute to Karl Lagerfeld  neglected to account for the late designer’s controversial reputation.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Met theme was “ Superfine: Tailoring Black Style ,” and marked the first time the museum had focused specifically on the style and designs of Black Americans, and the first to highlight menswear since 2003.\n \n\n   \n  The gala, for which tickets reportedly cost some $75,000, typically raises record funds for the museum: Last year, it brought in a whopping $31 million. The gala is the sole fundraiser for the Costume Institute’s exhibitions, acquisitions and maintenance; unlike other curatorial departments at the Met, the Costume Institute receives no money from the museum’s budget.\n \n\n   \n  As for more gala details and predictions? The content machines at Vogue have their work cut out for them over the next five months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/national-guard-portland-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:55:00-05:00","title":"Hundreds of National Guard Troops Deployed to Portland and Chicago Are Being Sent Home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Portland and Chicago are being withdrawn, with all 200 California National Guard troops and 200 Texas troops sent home.

Guard troops deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, are being sent home, and those who will remain will continue to stay off the streets amid  court battles  over their domestic mission by the Trump administration, a defense official said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The withdrawal of soldiers — sent from California and Texas — is part of a larger change to troop deployments after  President Donald Trump  began his  immigration crackdown  in various cities with Democratic leadership. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and requested anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  US Northern Command said in a statement Sunday it was “shifting and/or rightsizing” units in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago, although it said there would be a “constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.”\n \n\n   \n  In the coming days, all 200 California National Guard troops currently deployed to Portland will be sent home, the official said. The military also plans to cut the number of Oregon National Guard troops on deployment there from 200 soldiers to 100, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  About 200 Texas National Guard troops in Chicago also are being sent home and about 200 soldiers will be on standby at Fort Bliss, an Army base that stretches across parts of Texas and New Mexico, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  About 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area, also doing training, but they currently are not legally allowed to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The official said the upcoming holiday season may have played a role in the change in deployments.\n \n\n   \n  Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, applauded the return of all California National Guard troops in Oregon, saying Trump “never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re glad they’re finally coming home,” she wrote in an email. “It’s long overdue!”\n \n\n   \n  Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek called on the Trump administration to demobilize the remaining 100 troops in her state, as well.\n \n\n   \n  “Members of the Oregon National Guard, who are our friends and neighbors, have been away from their families and jobs for 50 days on an unnecessary deployment,” Kotek said in a written statement. “With the holidays approaching, every single member deserves to go home.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the Trump administration  doesn’t communicate its plans  with state leaders and was still threatening to federalize more troops.\n \n\n   \n  “This confirms what we have always known: This is about normalizing military forces in American cities,” Pritzker spokesman Matt Hill said in a statement Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Hill didn’t immediately return a message left Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which filed a separate lawsuit on the issue currently before the US Supreme Court —  have been pushing back . They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut in  Portland this month  issued a permanent injunction blocking Trump from deploying troops in the city, saying he had failed to establish that he was legally entitled to do so. On Sunday, the administration filed an emergency motion seeking to put the ruling on hold while it appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in  Charlotte, North Carolina , expanding an aggressive campaign that’s been spearheaded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard deployments have been one of the most controversial initiatives of Trump’s second term, demonstrating an expanded willingness to use the military to accomplish domestic goals.\n \n\n   \n  Troops,  including active-duty Marines , were deployed to Los Angeles during immigration protests earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard was also sent to  Washington, D.C. , where they were part of a broader federal intervention that Trump claimed was necessary because of crime problems.\n \n\n   \n  The deployments later expanded to Portland and Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Although they don’t play a law enforcement role, members of the National Guard have been tasked with protecting federal facilities, particularly those run by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  About 100 troops who have been in Los Angeles will remain on deployment there, the defense official said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-week-11-wrap","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:56:00Z","title":"A different type of football hits Spain, Aaron Rodgers hurt and Shedeur Sanders makes NFL debut: Week 11 Sunday wrap","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NFL season reached a pivotal point in Week 11, marked by international expansion, major injuries, and high-stakes matchups.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the season drags on and the playoff picture begins to take focus, the 2025  NFL  campaign is shaping up to be a year marked by a changing of the guard.\n \n\n   \n  More than half of the league’s current division leaders are teams on a 5-plus-year division championship drought.\n \n\n   \n  With Thanksgiving drawing near and the long grind of the season starting to take its toll, time will tell which of these contenders has the moxie to take it across the finish line.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Week 11’s Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Football, not fútbol, debuts in Spain\n \n\n   \n  The day began with a piece of NFL history in Madrid. The Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders met in the league’s first ever regular season game in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  Playing at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the home ground of European  soccer  giant  Real Madrid , the Dolphins prevailed over the Commanders 16-13 in overtime.\n \n\n   \n  The game featured plenty of kicking – an ironic turn of events in the soccer-mad nation – as the Dolphins and Commanders combined for five field goals and just two touchdowns.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, it was a 29-yard kick in OT from Miami’s Riley Patterson that lifted the Dolphins to the win.\n \n\n   \n    Aaron Rodgers exits with injury in contentious rivalry game\n \n\n   \n  In one of the league’s most heated rivalries, the Pittsburgh Steelers blasted the Cincinnati Bengals 34-12 to press their advantage in the AFC North.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers sit atop the division after the victory, seeking their first AFC North crown since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  The win came with a cost, however, as Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Fame quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  left the game at halftime with an injured wrist.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers came down hard on his left, non-throwing wrist while being tackled late in the second quarter. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said after the game that his starting QB will undergo further examination on the wrist on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Later Sunday evening, ESPN’s Adam Schefter  reported  that the team fears that Rodgers has “a slight break” in his left wrist, citing unnamed sources.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers cruised in the second half without the four-time MVP signal-caller thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns and solid play from backup quarterback Mason Rudolph.\n \n\n   \n  Things turned ugly in the fourth quarter after a scuffle broke out between Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase and Steelers defensive back Jalen Ramsey, with Ramsey being ejected from the game for throwing a punch.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Ramsey told reporters the punch was prompted by Chase spitting on him: “He spit on me. I don’t give a f**k after that, respectfully. I’m always gonna be all for trash talking, sh*t talking, stuff like that. I actually enjoy that part of the game.”\n \n\n   \n  Chase denied the accusations while speaking to reporters in the locker room postgame,  saying , “I ain’t ever open my mouth to that guy.\n \n\n   \n  “We were going back and forth the whole time, so I’m sure something got under his skin … I didn’t spit on nobody.”\n \n\n   \n  However,  video  shot by CNN affiliate WXIX does appear to show Chase spit on Ramsey, the second high-profile  spitting incident  in the NFL this season.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the NFL handed Chase a  one-game suspension  without pay over the “act of unsportsmanlike conduct.”\n \n\n   \n    Bills beat Bucs in barnburner\n \n\n   \n  In a matchup of two teams seemingly destined for the postseason, the Buffalo Bills emerged victorious after a high-scoring slugfest against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n \n\n   \n  The game featured an astonishing nine lead changes, with the Bills ultimately walking away with the 44-32 win.\n \n\n   \n  Reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen improved his chances to lift the award again as he tallied a mind-boggling six touchdowns in the game. The Bills quarterback threw three TDs and also ran for three scores in the thrilling contest.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills needed the win as they try to keep pace with the surprising New England Patriots, who lead the AFC East after a 27-14 victory over the New York Jets on Thursday night.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats haven’t won the division since 2019 when Tom Brady was still under center in New England and look like the real deal this season.\n \n\n   \n    Broncos deal the Chiefs a devastating defeat\n \n\n   \n  The Denver Broncos took firm control of the AFC West with a 22-19 win against the Kansas City Chiefs, who have won the division nine consecutive seasons.\n \n\n   \n  Denver improved to a perfect 6-0 at home this season as the Broncos’ stout defense stymied the Chiefs.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ lone touchdown on the day was a 21-yard strike to tight end Travis Kelce with just under 10 minutes left in the game to put the Chiefs up three.\n \n\n   \n  The score was Kelce’s 84th touchdown, making him the Chiefs’ all-time TD leader by passing Priest Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos were powered by the mighty right leg of kicker Wil Lutz, who drilled five field goals in the game – and three in the fourth quarter – including a game-winning 35-yarder as time expired.\n \n\n   \n  After the loss, the Chiefs, who have appeared in three straight Super Bowls and seven straight AFC Championship games, drop to 5-5 on the season and are in serious danger of missing the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The road doesn’t get any easier for the Chiefs either. Next week, Kansas City faces the impressive Indianapolis Colts, who enjoyed a bye this week. Indy is one of the NFL’s biggest surprises this season; with one of the AFC’s best records at 8-2, the Colts are poised to win the AFC South for the first time since 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Broncos now sit two games clear of the Los Angeles Chargers in pursuit of their first division crown since 2015.\n \n\n   \n    Shedeur Sanders makes NFL debut as Browns fall to Ravens\n \n\n   \n  After losing four straight games amid an injury to  quarterback Lamar Jackson , the return of the Baltimore’s two-time league MVP has sparked a four-game winning streak as the Ravens have clawed their way back to .500 and back in the AFC playoff discussion.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens had to rally on Sunday for a 23-16 win against the Cleveland Browns after trailing 13-3 in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  The Browns’ fortunes turned when quarterback Dillon Gabriel was knocked out of the game with a concussion early in the third quarter. The injury set the stage for the NFL debut of 2025 fifth-round draft pick  Shedeur Sanders , son of Hall of Famer  Deion Sanders .\n \n\n   \n  Sanders’ first NFL game was a forgettable one, as the 23-year-old went just 4-of-16 passing for 47 yards and one interception.\n \n\n   \n  Tied at 16 late in the fourth quarter, the game was still in doubt until an inspired bit of misdirection just before the two-minute warning gave Baltimore its first lead since the first quarter.\n \n\n   \n  On a 4th & 1, Baltimore lined up in the “ tush push ” formation with tight end Mark Andrews under center. But instead of plowing forward, Andrews took the ball to the right edge and ran untouched for a 35-yard, game-winning touchdown.\n \n\n   \n    Darnold’s 4 INTs doom Seahawks\n \n\n   \n  With the NFC West lead on the line, neither the Seattle Seahawks nor the Los Angeles Rams played their best football.\n \n\n   \n  But in the end, Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold’s four interceptions – two of which led to Rams touchdowns – proved to be the difference in LA’s 21-19 win. Safety Kamren Kinchens hauled in two of the interceptions for LA.\n \n\n   \n  With the win, the Rams take sole possession of first place in the division at 8-2, while the Seahawks fall to 7-3 on the year.\n \n\n   \n    Eagles outlast Lions in defensive struggle\n \n\n   \n  In Sunday’s finale, the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles met the Detroit Lions in one of Week 11’s most anticipated matchups.\n \n\n   \n  The result may not have been pretty at times, but the Eagles escaped with a 16-9 home win in a game dominated by the defenses.\n \n\n   \n  The Eagles’ offense might not be firing like it was during last season’s playoff run, but the team’s certainly sporting a championship-caliber defense. For the second consecutive week, Philly held a playoff contender under 10 points.\n \n\n   \n  The Lions’ loss puts the Chicago Bears alone atop the NFC North after the Bears eked past the Minnesota Vikings 19-17 earlier in the day. Despite a negative point differential on the season, Chicago boasts a 7-3 record as the Monsters of the Midway eye their first division title since 2018.\n \n\n   \n    Full NFL Week 11 Sunday scores\n \n\n   \n   Away @ home (winners in bold) \n \n\n   \n  Washington Commanders 13-16 (OT)  Miami Dolphins  (in Madrid, Spain)\n \n\n   \n   Green Bay Packers  27-20 New York Giants\n \n\n   \n   Houston Texans  16-13 Tennessee Titans\n \n\n   \n   Carolina Panthers  30-27 (OT) Atlanta Falcons\n \n\n   \n   Chicago Bears  19-17 Minnesota Vikings\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers 6-35  Jacksonville Jaguars \n \n\n   \n  Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32-44  Buffalo Bills \n \n\n   \n  Cincinnati Bengals 12-34  Pittsburgh Steelers \n \n\n   \n   San Francisco 49ers  41-22 Arizona Cardinals\n \n\n   \n  Seattle Seahawks 19-21  Los Angeles Rams \n \n\n   \n  Kansas City Chiefs 19-22  Denver Broncos \n \n\n   \n   Baltimore Ravens  23-16 Cleveland Browns\n \n\n   \n  Detroit Lions 9-16  Philadelphia Eagles \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/oj-simpson-estate-worth-goldman","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00-05:00","title":"O.J.

At least 98 Palestinians died in Israeli prisons in two years, Israeli human rights group finds \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, Abeer Salman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since October 2023, and the true death toll is likely higher given that a large number of people detained in Gaza are missing, according to a  new report  from an Israel-based human rights group, citing official Israeli data and other sources.\n \n\n   \n  The report by Physicians for Human Rights - Israel (PHRI) is based on official Israeli records and data obtained through freedom of information requests, which it cross-referenced with forensic reports, interviews with family members and lawyers, testimonies from detained Palestinians, information published by other human rights groups and other individual inquiries to locate specific detained persons.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians died in custody from physical violence, medical neglect or both, according to PHRI, an Israeli advocacy group made up of medical professionals and human rights activists.\n \n\n   \n  PHRI found that 46 Palestinians died in the custody of the Israel Prison Service since the outbreak of the war and that at least 52 Palestinians — all from Gaza — died in Israeli military custody.\n \n\n   \n  “The fate of hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza detained by the Israeli military remains unknown to this day, suggesting that the true number of deaths is likely significantly higher than those documented here,” the PHRI report noted.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli authorities stopped providing information to the Red Cross regarding Palestinians in custody in the early days of the war and barred access to detention facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The last publicly available data that the Israeli military provided on deaths in detention was from May 2024, and the Israel Prison Service’s last provided data was from September 2024. After that, PHRI was able to document additional deaths using information from firsthand testimonies and official responses to requests submitted by the Palestinian Authority.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the allegations in the report, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) told CNN it “operates in accordance with the law” and that “all inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff.” It added that it does not comment on figures or allegations presented by outside organizations.\n \n\n   \n  “The claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented,” the IPS said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unprecedented’ number of deaths\n \n\n   \n  “The unprecedented number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli custody over the past two years, together with clear evidence of deaths caused by torture and medical neglect, points to a deliberate Israeli policy of killing Palestinians while in detention,” Oneg Ben Dror, the project coordinator for PHRI’s prisoners and detainees department, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings — and the ongoing failure of Israeli law enforcement to prosecute those responsible — turn Israeli law itself into a fig leaf and a tool for concealment,” Ben Dror added.\n \n\n   \n  The report provides details on the deaths of Palestinians classified as “security prisoners,” which includes detainees held without charge or without trial.\n \n\n   \n  While the identities of some of those who died in Israeli custody remain unknown, the report identified 73 of the Palestinians who died. Those named in the report include  Dr. Adnan al-Bursh , 53, who was the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza and died after reported signs of “physical abuse” in prison, according to testimony from a fellow detainee who has since been released. The report also named 17-year-old  Walid Khalid Ahmad , who died following prolonged malnutrition, according to an autopsy report.\n \n\n   \n  PHRI concluded in the report that Israeli authorities have waged an “unprecedented assault on detained Palestinians,” arguing that Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, took steps to “deliberately worsen conditions of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Israeli Ministry of National Security for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Ben-Gvir previously advocated for the minimum conditions by law and said that “the conditions in prison add deterrence.” He also lashed out at the Israeli Supreme Court in September after it ruled that the state was not providing adequate food to Palestinian prisoners and must improve their nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  Deaths occurred at nearly all Israeli prison facilities, which the report said “further underscores the systematic and ongoing nature of these killings in Israeli custody.”\n \n\n   \n  Among those who died in Israeli prison facilities, 17 were from Gaza, 26 were from the occupied West Bank and three held Israeli citizenship, according to the report. The data shows that “on average, two Palestinians died every month in IPS detention facilities, with the number of deaths steadily increasing over time.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has  previously reported on abuse, medical neglect and horrific conditions  at the Sde Teiman field hospital at an Israeli military base that now doubles as a detention center in Israel’s Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  The PHRI report found that from the start of the war through August of this year, 29 detained Palestinians from Gaza died at Sde Teiman in the custody of the Israeli military, and further deaths were recorded at military camps in southern Israel, Ofer and Anatot.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, PHRI announced it was joining leading Israeli  human rights group B’Tselem  in calling Israel’s actions in Gaza genocide. Israel has strongly rejected the accusations.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Stocks and Bitcoin Slide as Nerves Fray Ahead of Nvidia Earnings","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street experienced a sharp downturn on Monday as investors grew nervous ahead of two major events: Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report and the delayed September jobs report.

The broader S&P 500 fell 0.92%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.84%.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 13%.

And on Thursday, the September jobs report — long delayed because of the government shutdown — is set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  These two events will provide more insight about the issues that are “top of mind” for Wall Street, according to José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have  come under pressure  this month as concerns linger about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 5.5% since hitting a record high in late October.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are trying to discern whether the AI trade is on stable foundations, and whether the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting in December.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin slid on Monday and hovered just below $92,000, erasing its gains for this year. The cryptocurrency has tanked more than 26% in just six weeks after it hit a record high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  Tech and crypto-related stocks led the S&P 500 lower on Monday. Coinbase ( COIN ), a crypto exchange, fell 7%.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday dipped below their 50-day moving averages, according to FactSet. The 50-day moving average is a key threshold of support.\n \n\n   \n  “While the long-term uptrend is intact, we believe a corrective pullback/consolidation phase is already underway after the market’s six-month winning streak,” Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks are coming off a  volatile week . Tech stocks took a bruising last week before investors swooped in on Friday to buy the dip.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this week are gearing up for a potential market-moving event with Nvidia’s earnings. The chipmaker accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500’s market value. Nvidia shares fell 1.83% on Monday, weighing on the broader market.\n \n\n   \n  “The monthly jobs report would normally dominate this week’s economic calendar, but with the AI trade struggling the past couple of weeks, Nvidia’s earnings are once again looking like a key piece of the market’s momentum puzzle,” Chris Larkin, managing director at Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The recent stock market rally is also being tested as investors adjust to the prospect that the Fed might pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting next month. Traders are pricing in a 45% chance that the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 94% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks have rallied on optimism about Fed rate cuts. Nerves are mounting that the central bank may prioritize concerns about stubborn inflation.\n \n\n   \n  “Data releases starting this week should provide a clearer picture for one of the key risks over the coming weeks — the December Fed meeting,” Mohit Kumar, chief strategist and economist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this month have also rotated out of high-flying tech stocks and moved into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  “This rotation is both expected and welcome, as it should unwind some of the frothiness … and allow this bull market the opportunity to catch its breath before resuming its advance,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said in a note.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/soviet-union-refugee-deported-ukraine-immigration","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:19:00-05:00","title":"Roman Surovtsev, Father of Two, Faces Deportation to War-Torn Ukraine After Conviction Vacated","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Roman Surovtsev, a father of two from Mariupol, Ukraine, fled the Soviet Union as a child due to his father’s death from radiation poisoning at Chernobyl.

He was still absent for his wife’s birthday a month later, then their wedding anniversary, and soon to be the holidays – Surovtsev’s favorite time of year to spend with his family.\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been telling her young daughters their dad is at work, and gave their oldest a locket with his picture inside after he was detained. She’s been wearing it more often in recent days, her mother said, asking the photo inside, “Daddy, come home.”\n \n\n   \n  “They’re too little to understand, and there’s no way to tell them without making them fearful of their own country,” Samantha said through tears. She and the girls have been living on savings as they accumulate attorney fees, and she said she feels like she’s going through life as a single mom.\n \n\n   \n  In a court filing on Wednesday, the Department of Justice confirmed it has arranged for Surovtsev to be removed to Ukraine on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an  X post  Monday that Surovtsev is a “criminal illegal alien with a history of violence,” including assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and carjacking.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys say 82 other immigrants will be on Surovtsev’s flight with the same fate, and fear for their safety in wartime Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m afraid that my life will be taken in this war, and my girls are going to have to grow up without their dad, my wife is going to have to be a widow, and I myself will lose my life in a war that I know nothing about,” Surovtsev said in a video reviewed by CNN his wife recorded during one of his calls to her from detention.\n \n\n   \n    Surovtsev found love, work and God after escaping Soviet rule\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was born in the USSR city of Zhdanov – which has since been renamed Mariupol in present-day Ukraine – in 1984. After his father, a Chernobyl nuclear power plant worker, died from radiation poisoning after it  exploded , Surovtsev fled the USSR at 4 years old with his mother and two siblings.\n \n\n   \n  The family came to the US lawfully, forfeiting their USSR citizenship, and slept in a San Francisco church for six months before settling further north in Sacramento, court filings show. But poverty followed them across California.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was a young child when he began stealing small toys in an effort to hide that his family was poor, court filings show, and he was around 7 years old when he started helping his mother work by cleaning homes and law offices. What followed was a boyhood marked by struggles to get by in his adopted country.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014. Following his sentence, an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported, costing him his green card. He was placed into ICE custody but ultimately released by the US government on an order of supervision, after it determined it wasn’t likely he would be removed from the country anytime soon, and in that case, continued detention would be unlawful, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Without USSR citizenship or a green card, Surovtsev has since lived his life as a  stateless person  with a work permit, routinely checking in with ICE. He’s never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers said in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  As his family found relief from Soviet rule in the United States, Surovtsev also found love, gratifying work, and God.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Surovtsev was baptized in prison. When he came to Christ, everything changed, his wife said. He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County. The two married, bought a home in a suburb north of Dallas, started a painting business together and welcomed their two girls.\n \n\n   \n  “He created a life here, and he’s being ripped away from it,” she said. “The person he is on paper is not the person he is now. Twenty years have passed since he committed that crime and a lot of life has been lived.”\n \n\n   \n  Between juggling the family business and raising his daughters, Surovtsev was training to be part of a prison ministry where he could travel to jails offering religious services and support for detainees.\n \n\n   \n  Then, he was detained himself.\n \n\n   \n  At the Bluebonnet and Prairieland Detention Facilities in Texas, where he has been held since August, Surovtsev’s faith hasn’t wavered, his wife said. He leads a nightly Bible study with his fellow inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Since he anticipates boarding a flight to Ukraine Monday, the group held an extra session this weekend to rally around him in prayer one more time.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, the US government plans to deport 83 people to Ukraine where they will be conscripted into the army and likely killed. Ukraine is a police state where the population lives under martial law,” Surovtsev’s attorneys Eric Lee and Chris Godshall-Bennett said in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Neither DHS nor the Ukrainian Embassy responded to CNN requests for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Among the detainees are individuals who have lived in the US since they were kids. Many have US citizen spouses and children,” the lawyers wrote. “Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev does not speak or read Ukrainian. Having fled at such a young age, Surovtsev has very little memory of the former Soviet town where he was born, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s birthplace, present-day Mariupol, Ukraine, has endured some of the most  devastating strikes and sieges  from Russia during the war. The city’s infrastructure and housing were  almost entirely destroyed , civilians suffer from  starvation , and thousands have been killed or displaced. Despite reconstruction efforts being promoted by  Russian authorities , the city remains heavily damaged.\n \n\n   \n    Lawyers say Surovtsev is close to regaining his green card status\n \n\n   \n  The US government had run into trouble trying to deport Surovtsev before.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six weeks. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  “Often when he met with officers, he was told that ICE had made a new attempt to contact the embassy of either Ukraine, Russia or both, but that either or both governments had refused to grant him travel documents,” his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans. But on August 1, he was unexpectedly detained, and an officer refused to accept his stay of removal from his immigration counsel who accompanied him to the appointment, his lawyers write in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  But now it’s unclear what documentation Ukraine may have for Surovtsev’s deportation or what changed from a decade ago, when the country couldn’t prove his citizenship.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2014 and 2015, ICE tried and failed to deport Mr. Surovtsev to Ukraine when the Ukrainian consulate told them it couldn’t prove he was a citizen,” Lee, the attorney, said in a statement. “Now we are told Ukraine is giving ‘temporary passports’ to detainees, whatever that means. To this day Ukraine has never acknowledged Mr. Surovtsev is a citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s always complied, but we knew that maybe something would be different this year, just because of what was going on with this immigration crackdown,” his wife said. “We didn’t think that this would be our reality.”\n \n\n   \n  His detainment mobilized Samantha, when she said she became his “assistant full-time” as she tirelessly drafted a legal team to get him out.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys successfully vacated Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, and will have him plead to a lesser charge that doesn’t have immigration consequences.\n \n\n   \n  This change in circumstances would justify reopening his case, which his team has filed for, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said, and Surovtsev’s lawful permanent resident status would be restored if a judge agreed to dismiss it.\n \n\n   \n  All his family and legal team can do is wait for the case to be heard, but it sits in a heavy queue of similar motions. There is no expedited process at the immigration court level, Rozdzielski said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of securing post-conviction relief for a past crime, he is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active warzone,” Surovtsev’s attorneys Lee and Godshall-Bennett said.\n \n\n   \n  The flight to Ukraine is poised to take off before a judge could make any new rulings. The motion was filed on November 4, and his attorney estimates a two- to three-month timeline.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family, our community and our country is not better off with him gone,” Samantha said. “Even if he’s remaining in detention, we just want time for our case to be heard. That’s all we want.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/horizon-air-cockpit-emergency","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:55:00-05:00","title":"Off-duty pilot who tried to cut a flight’s engines midair won’t serve prison time, judge rules","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former Alaska Airlines pilot, Joseph Emerson, attempted to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight in 2023 while off-duty in the cockpit, leading to a near-disaster that was averted by the flight crew.

flight’s engines midair won’t serve prison time, judge rules \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:55 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A former Alaska Airlines pilot who  tried to cut the engines  of a passenger flight in 2023 while riding off-duty in the cockpit will serve no prison time, a federal judge ruled Monday, bringing an end to a case that drew attention to the need for more mental health support for pilots.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Amy Baggio sentenced Joseph Emerson to credit for time served and supervised release for three years at a hearing in Portland, Oregon. Federal prosecutors had asked for one year in prison, while his attorneys had sought probation.\n \n\n   \n  “Pilots are not perfect. They are human,” she said. “They are people and all people need help sometimes.”\n \n\n   \n  Emerson was subdued by the flight crew after trying to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on Oct. 22, 2023, while he was riding in an extra seat in the cockpit. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.\n \n\n   \n  After his arrest, Emerson  told police  he was despondent over a friend’s recent death, had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier, and hadn’t slept in over 40 hours. He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane’s fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.\n \n\n   \n  Baggio said it “offers a cautionary tale worth telling beyond the confines of this case.”\n \n\n   \n  Before she announced the sentence, Emerson spoke and said he regretted the harm he caused to society.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a victim. I am here as a direct result of my actions,” he told the court. “I can tell you that this very tragic event has forced me to grow as an individual.”\n \n\n   \n  He hugged his attorneys and shared a tearful embrace with his wife after the judge announced his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple people spoke on Emerson’s behalf at the hearing, including his wife, Sarah Stretch, who told the judge how the incident had impacted their family.\n \n\n   \n  “I am so sorry for those that it’s impacted as much as it has. But I am extremely proud to be here with this man today, because the growth that he has had from this terrible experience has not only helped him, but benefited all that surround him,” she said through tears. “I just hope people realize that it’s not necessarily the mistake itself but how you respond to it. He has responded with courage, strength and demonstration of extreme resiliency.”\n \n\n   \n  Emerson had pleaded guilty or no-contest to all charges against him in September as part of agreements with state and federal prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Emerson, of Pleasant Hill, California, was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft. He was released from custody pending trial in December 2023, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  A state court sentenced him to 50 days in jail, with credit for time served, plus five years of probation, 664 hours of community service — eight hours for each person he endangered — and over $60,000 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group.\n \n\n   \n  Half of his community service can be performed at the  pilot health nonprofit  he founded after his arrest. He must also undergo assessments for drug and alcohol and mental health treatment, refrain from using any unprescribed drugs, and keep at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) away from operable aircraft unless he has permission from his probation officer.\n \n\n   \n  In their sentencing memo asking for one year in prison, federal prosecutors wrote: “It was only through the heroic actions of the flight crew, who were able to physically restrain the defendant and restore normal operations of the aircraft, that no lives were lost that day.”\n \n\n   \n  In a sentencing memo, his attorneys requested probation with credit for time served over prison or home detention, arguing that the “robust” state prosecution “resulted in substantial punishment.”\n \n\n   \n  In state court in September, Emerson said he was grateful to the flight crew for restraining him and saving his life, along with those of everyone else on board. He called it “the greatest gift I ever got,” even though he lost his career and wound up in jail, because it forced him to confront his mental health challenges and reliance on alcohol.\n \n\n   \n  “This difficult journey has made me a better father, a better husband, a better member of my community,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The airline has said that other members of the flight crew had not observed signs of impairment that would have barred Emerson from the cockpit.\n \n\n   \n  The averted disaster renewed attention on  cockpit safety  and the  mental fitness  of those allowed in them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/rebecca-gayheart-eric-dane-als-diagnosis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:44:00Z","title":"Rebecca Gayheart Discusses the 'Complicated' Challenges of Parenting Her Daughters with Eric Dane Amid His ALS Diagnosis","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rebecca Gayheart, the former wife of actor Eric Dane, shares her experiences as a parent during the difficult time of Dane’s ALS diagnosis, despite their formal separation in 2018.

Her white silk dress, draped across her chest in an off-the-shoulder style with a cascading leg split, was designed by Jonathan Anderson for Dior — the French luxury label for which she has been a brand ambassador since 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Many celebrities have ambassadorship roles with big brands, and are often contractually obliged to wear their designs on the red carpets and other major events. See Margaret Qualley, who often wears Chanel (much to the dismay of some social media users) since becoming brand ambassador in 2022, while longtime Louis Vuitton face Emma Stone has almost exclusively worn clothes by the French luxury house since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  But Dior isn’t the only brand that Lawrence was advertising in her recent outing. In her ears were a pair of 1987 diamond clips shaped like glittering tree branches. Designed by the American jeweler Joel Arthur Rosenthal, they were worth between $300,000 and $500,000. The cost is an estimate, because these earrings are scheduled to go on auction next month at Sotheby’s in New York, where their price will be determined by a bidding war — presumably between some people who may have enjoyed seeing them on Lawrence first. In the same auction are several more of Rosenthal’s pieces, as well as a 1930s ruby and diamond bracelet from Cartier and a late 19th century necklace by Boucheron, worth between $1 and $2 million.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t the first time Lawrence has acted as ad space for Sotheby’s. Earlier this month, the auction house lent her an 18-karat gold, platinum and enamel necklace by jeweler David Webb worth between $25,000 and $35,000 ahead of its scheduled auction on December 11. The actor wore the necklace to the New York premiere of “Die My Love,” her latest high-profile film with Robert Pattinson.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s has lent jewels to celebrities including Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Rihanna in the past, for the 2023 and 2021 Met Gala, respectively, with the diamond Chopra Jonas wore selling for CHF 22 million (over $27 million) days later. Lawrence, meanwhile, is making sure soon-to-be-auctioned pieces are being seen beyond the first Monday in May.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s decision to engage with fashion marketing playbook’s may help to offset a slumped high-end art market. According to 2025  data  from ArtTactic, a research firm specializing in the art market, auction sales at Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips declined for the third year in a row, as ongoing inflation and rising geopolitical tensions have created a more cautious environment among investors.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in a move that is considerably agile for a 281-year-old auction house, Sotheby’s is making use of a famous face that could potentially entice new audiences. Jewels worn by celebrities have proven to drive interest (and sales) — take the influential singer Shirley Bassey’s collection of treasures, which broke a world-record when the entire lot sold in a Paris auction for €2.2 million (around $2.5 million). Could Sotheby’s recreate some of that magic by lending lesser-known auction lots to top-of-their-game actors? When the gavel comes down next month, we’ll find out if the star power rubbed off on the final sales price.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/americas/analysis-trump-military-action-venezuela-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00Z","title":"Whatever Trump’s goal in Venezuela, US military action is unlikely to achieve it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the likelihood of US military action under Donald Trump's administration against Venezuela, questioning whether such actions—ranging from targeted strikes to regime change or land invasions—would achieve meaningful outcomes.

EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the vacillating contours of US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy, little should surprise. And outlying moments of apparent success against  Iran’s nuclear program  (even if short-lived), are uneasily partnered with moments of fleeting fancy, like  seizing Greenland  (remember that?)\n \n\n   \n  But the looming possibility of  military action against Venezuela  – across a wide spectrum of violent options – drags the White House into realms of foreign involvement it has always said it loathed. And it puts it squarely in opposition to the lessons of the past two decades of US Republican military endeavors, and plenty of decades of regional experience before that.\n \n\n   \n  Just what exactly does the Trump administration want to do here, and how long does it think it will take to achieve? These are two questions an administration conventionally seeks to publicly and painstakingly lay out the answers to before military action. But it remains mired in confusion. And the variables do not look good.\n \n\n   \n  The most slender goal of military action is to stop drug trafficking. Yet this is something exceptionally hard to achieve with targeted strikes. Firstly, Venezuela is  not the hub of narco-trafficking : that is a route which begins in neighboring Colombia, and ends on the US border in Mexico. Venezuela has been a facilitator, even permitting its territory to be used to launch the planes that carry Colombian cocaine north, and harboring depots and processing plants which operate in a climate of greater impunity than in Colombia. But it is at worst a tenth of the problem, not its heart.\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, the drug trade is so unspeakably profitable, no kinetic activity can really stop it. The incentives are simply too great. Consider the planes that fly north from Venezuela – booming during the first Trump term, using 50 covert runways in Venezuela’s Zulia region to move their packages to central America for onward transportation, according to Colombian officials.\n \n\n   \n  Each plane makes the trip once, and as we saw across  Honduras’ Moskitia coastline in 2019 , is abandoned in the bush. The money to be made from its cargo is in the tens of millions, while the plane is worth only about $150,000, so it is logically dumped rather than used again, decreasing the risk of capture. This is the mindset of trafficking: there is truly little couriers would not do for their part of millions of dollars, for a few weeks’ risky work. And there is too much product to get too anxious: one official told me then of how these tiny planes, when they feared interception at sea, would simply throw their cargo overboard and pay local fisherman $150,000 to return the cocaine to them.\n \n\n   \n  Traffickers have since turned to boats – and even unmanned submersibles guided by Starlink satellite internet dishes – to evade capture. A concerted US bombing campaign can at best hope to disrupt this sort of extraordinary profiteering. But you cannot kill the business unless you kill the demand feeding it in the United States itself.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is the question of affordability for the United States. The Pentagon used to be concerned about putting an expensive “warhead on the forehead” of jihadist militants a decade ago. It is wildly inefficient to send a million-dollar missile to incinerate raw cocaine, so close to source that it has yet to earn anywhere near its eventual US street value. Colombia is currently close to record cocaine production, according to the UN, so there is no shortage of powder to try to move.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration can set back, inconvenience, delay or even hamper, drug trafficking in the region. But Venezuela is not its main source, and there will always be poor, disadvantaged young men there, or in Colombia, Ecuador or Bolivia, willing to step into any vacancy left by US drone strikes.\n \n\n   \n  So what if regime change is the goal? To “shock and awe” Venezuela’s fragile and economically beleaguered authoritarian, Nicolas Maduro, into fleeing? A series of pinpoint airstrikes could destroy key assets in  Venezuela’s military  – its runways, air defenses, Su-30 attack jets, and Russian T-72 tanks. But military action is already being  discussed publicly , giving Maduro plenty of warning to move his most prized equipment, including his political hierarchy, and even himself.\n \n\n   \n  The most technologically advanced military power in history still has limitations. It may have been able to kill al Qaeda’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, using a missile equipped with spinning blades on a balcony in Kabul in 2022. But it was unable to stop its humiliating ousting from the same city a year earlier, by a far inferior Taliban force.\n \n\n   \n  US policy needs popular support from the people it is being imposed upon, and that is rarely achieved from a missile launch at 30,000 feet. In Iraq, even the tortured and false arguments amassed to remove the vile butcher Saddam Hussein ran into an Iraqi people who widely rejected occupation at the barrel of an M4 assault rifle. Many Serbians were angered by NATO bombing in 1999, even though the source of their woes, Slobodan Milosevic, was defenestrated a year later.\n \n\n   \n  Looming US action in Venezuela is beset with so many historical comparables because the US has tried this so many times before. Indeed, the one thing the US might try to foment – a popular revolt to install a more friendly government – Trump has  tried before  too.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, a brief call to insurrection tried to start a military coup of sorts that seemed to aim to replace Maduro. It fell utterly flat, and I recall arriving in Caracas to scenes of underwhelming calm. The plot had barely rattled Maduro. And that was after months of intense US and Colombian pressure, in which Juan Guaido – a relatively popular reformist leader who had won recent legislative elections – presented the country with an alternative, internationally recognized government-in-waiting, ready to go.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has tried before to shake Caracas so hard that Maduro would topple, but he failed. Whatever the fate of Maduro, any repeat bid at regime change needs to be sure what follows is actually in US interests, and not a more aggressive subordinate in Maduro’s place.\n \n\n   \n  And what of the favorite canard of US military policy: the land invasion? Dropping thousands of young Americans into an angry coastal nation of 30 million, twice the size of California, is the polar opposite of Trump’s obsession with Nobel Prizes for ending wars, and lessening the US global footprint.\n \n\n   \n  It is logistically suicidal with the mere 15,000 US troops currently amassed in the region. And it would stir the acid-reflux echo of the  Bay of Pigs , where the US tried to oust a similarly leftist dictator in Cuba, in a botched operation that has become a by-word for damaging CIA overreach in the Americas.\n \n\n   \n  It is hard to evaluate the Trump administration’s goals as it has been purposefully opaque with them. But across their spectrum, it will find an adversary wildly more incentivized to adapt and continue, or options for regime change that have failed in the past 25 years, or even in their first term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hope is perhaps that the sound and fury – if this is not itself the goal of the operation – will signify enough that Maduro makes a deal to flee alive.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump’s officials run into a contradiction of their own policy here. If Maduro is the kingpin trafficker and narco-terrorist they say he is, then surely his decisions about fleeing are complicated by this role, rather than simplified? There will surely be powerful and violent people who need him to stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Wherever Trump has secretly landed in his policy decisions, he may soon learn it is hard to send the guns home without using them, and perhaps harder still to know what to do with them once they have fired.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/science/parasitic-ant-queen-workers-kill-mother","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"13:58:00-05:00","title":"Scientists uncover an ant assassination scheme that helps a parasitic queen rise to power","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have discovered that parasitic ant queens from *Lasius orientalis* and *Lasius umbratus* infiltrate host colonies by mimicking the scent of nestmates, enabling them to evade detection.

Scientists uncover an ant assassination scheme that helps a parasitic queen rise to power \n       \n  By Mindy Weisberger, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:58 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have for the first time unlocked how a parasitic ant uses chemical warfare to take over the nest of a different species, by tricking workers into an unlikely assassination.\n \n\n   \n  The deadly scheme unfolds like a Shakespearean drama. In an ant colony, the queen is dying, under attack by her own daughters. Meanwhile, the true enemy — an invader queen from another ant species — waits on the sidelines. Her plan is simple: Infiltrate the nest and use chemical weapons brewed inside her body to deceive the worker ants into mistaking their rightful ruler for an imposter.\n \n\n   \n  In a few hours, the nest’s queen will fall. Once the former matriarch is dead, the invader will assume the role of the colony’s new leader.\n \n\n   \n  Matricide in an ant colony is not unheard of — it typically happens when a colony produces multiple queens or when a solo queen reaches the end of her fertility. But this particular scenario, in which an outsider queen turns workers into her proxy assassins, has never been described in detail before, researchers reported Monday  in the journal  Current Biology .\n \n\n   \n  In fact, this strategy is yet to be documented in any other animal species, said the study’s senior author Dr. Keizo Takasuka, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Kyushu in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  “Inducement of daughters to kill their biological mother had not been known in biology before this work,” Takasuka told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers observed this behavior among ants in the Lasius genus, documenting invasions and worker manipulation by queens in the species L. orientalis and L. umbratus.\n \n\n   \n  “Prior studies had reported that, after a new L. umbratus queen invaded a host colony of L. niger, host workers killed their own queen,” Takasuka said. “But the mechanism remained entirely unknown until our study.”\n \n\n   \n    Scent of a worker ant\n \n\n   \n  Ants communicate through smell, which is how they distinguish between nestmates and foes. When researchers previously observed parasitic ant queens near a colony’s foraging trails, they saw that the parasite would snatch up a worker ant and rub it on her body, disguising her scent and allowing her to slip into the nest undetected.\n \n\n   \n  For the new study, coauthors Taku Shimada and Yuji Tanaka — both citizen scientists in Tokyo — each raised an ant colony and introduced parasitic queens. Shimada observed an L. orientalis queen in an L. flavus colony, and Tanaka recorded an L. umbratus queen invading a colony of L. japonicus.\n \n\n   \n  In both experiments, the scientists first co-housed an invading queen with host workers and cocoons “so that she acquired the nestmate odour,” Takasuka said. “This allowed her to gain nestmate recognition and avoid retaliation upon entry.” The scientists then released the queen into the colony.\n \n\n   \n  Both parasite queens followed a similar plan of attack. After disguising their smell, the queens entered the colonies’ feeding areas. Most workers ignored the interloper. Some even fed her mouth-to-mouth.\n \n\n   \n  But the invading queens weren’t there for dinner — they had an assassination to set in motion. After locating the resident queen, the invader sprayed her with abdominal fluid that smelled of formic acid. The scent agitated workers, with some of them turning on their queen immediately and attacking her. Multiple sprays followed, and the attacks became more brutal.\n \n\n   \n  “The host workers eventually mutilated their true mother after four days,” the scientists reported.\n \n\n   \n    All in the family\n \n\n   \n  The death of the true queen was the invader’s cue to start producing hundreds of eggs, attended by her newly adopted “daughters.” Over time, her biological daughters would number in the thousands, usurping the colony until none of the original species remained.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s refreshing to see a very careful observational study that discovers something interesting that we — ‘we’ meaning ant researchers — suspected but had never confirmed,” said Dr. Jessica Purcell, a professor in the department of entomology at the University of California, Riverside.\n \n\n   \n  “I was really struck by this discovery, especially the use of a chemical compound to elicit that behavior by the workers,” said Purcell, who was not involved in the research.\n \n\n   \n  Social insects like ants gather and store resources for the colony to share. That makes them an attractive target for social parasites — species seeking well-stocked nests that they can exploit. Some ant species  kidnap the colony’s offspring   and enslave them. Others, such as L. orientalis and L. umbratus, set up shop in the colony, where they eliminate the existing queen and take her place.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s all of this amazing diversity,” Purcell told CNN. “What we didn’t know a lot about before this study, is the various ways that socially parasitic queens might go about assassinating the host queen. People had done some observations of direct killing where the infiltrating queen would go and cut off the head of the existing queen. But this is astonishing that they can actually use chemical manipulation to cause the workers to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Violence within families is often described in fairy tales and myths, with wicked adults — typically desperate parents or jealous stepparents — conspiring to harm or kill children. Rapunzel is imprisoned in a tower; Snow White is hunted and then poisoned by an apple; Hansel and Gretel are abandoned in the forest and captured by a witch, who imprisons them and fattens Hansel for her supper.\n \n\n   \n  But while such stories include plenty of violence, the killing of a mother in folklore — let alone children being tricked into matricide — is almost nonexistent, said Dr. Maria Tatar, a professor emerita of folklore and mythology at Harvard University who was not involved in the new study.\n \n\n   \n  In that respect, Takasuka noted, the grim tale of the invading, manipulative ant queens stands out even more.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes, phenomena in nature outstrip what we imagine in fiction,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/justin-trudeau-sophie-gregoire-katy-perry","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:55:00.000-05:00","title":"Sophie Grégoire breaks silence on Justin Trudeau’s romance with Katy Perry","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sophie Grégoire, former wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has opened up about the emotional toll of public scrutiny surrounding Trudeau’s relationship with singer Katy Perry.

And it has proved a massive unforced political error by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The man who has for a decade dominated his base and told  it  what to care about has backed down when that base decided its priorities didn’t align with his own.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a remarkable political moment — and an unfortuitous one for Trump, particularly right now.\n \n\n   \n    The reversal, and where it leaves us\n \n\n   \n  The big news overnight was that Trump seemed to relent after months of fighting an effort in the House to force the release of all Epstein files from the Justice Department. A significant number of Republicans had been expected to defect from Trump’s opposition to releasing the files in this week’s vote.\n \n\n   \n  “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” Trump  posted on social media , “and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’”\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that this isn’t the end of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Trump has a way of changing his mind. For two, the bill would still need to pass in the Senate — where Majority Leader John Thune  was noncommittal  on Monday — and be signed by Trump, though it’s hard to see how the president and Senate Republicans could resist those things now. And lastly, the  investigations Trump ordered last week of political foes  tied to Epstein could seemingly give the Justice Department a pretext not to release all the files.\n \n\n   \n  But it would be hard for even the president’s allies not to see through that, given Trump’s own  DOJ said in July  there was no “evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s reversal is a significant moment politically, because it suggests he is throwing in the towel on something he’s fought for months.\n \n\n   \n  While he cast his new posture as being in line with his prior comments on the matter, it’s a clear capitulation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have fought tooth and nail against the discharge petition that ultimately forced this vote. Trump last week threatened Republicans who signed on to it, calling them “stupid” and accusing them of playing into Democrats’ hands. The Epstein files were the central issue in Trump’s recent  rift with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia . And it’s possible he was about to see 100 or more Republicans bucking him on it in the House, according to estimates in recent days.\n \n\n   \n    For once, Trump succumbed to his own base\n \n\n   \n  Trump will likely pretend this wasn’t a rebuke of him personally. But it was. And it’s a pretty remarkable one at that.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past decade, he has fashioned a Republican Party that was largely about one thing: Trump. Whatever he said, went. It didn’t matter if the idea flew in the face of decades of conservative orthodoxy. It didn’t matter what Republican lawmakers previously espoused. It didn’t matter if Trump seemed to be making it up on the fly or breaking the law in the process. It didn’t matter if he was basing the policy on a series of fabrications. The unquestioning faith he garnered from his base was immense.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional Republicans have  rarely voted against Trump’s position ; when they have, it’s almost always been on foreign policy matters.\n \n\n   \n  But the Epstein files saga has shown that the base’s willingness to abide Trump has its limits — or at least, it does when the base feels strongly enough and when the president’s political capital starts to wane.\n \n\n   \n    What it portends for Trump\n \n\n   \n  That’s what’s particularly inauspicious for the president right now. It isn’t just his retreat, but the circumstances and timing of it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and there was no smoking gun in the thousands of documents released last week from the Epstein estate. But there’s no question that the revelations — about what Trump knew about the convicted sex offender and when — have been bad for him politically. Those include  emails  in which Epstein said Trump “knew about the girls” Ghislaine Maxwell recruited from Mar-a-Lago, and that Trump spent hours with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.\n \n\n   \n  Despite this looking bad for Trump, many congressional Republicans had apparently decided releasing the full files from the DOJ simply wasn’t something they could vote against. Unlike so many other things, they couldn’t ignore what their base has long been clamoring for in the service of Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most important about Trump’s capitulation, politically speaking, is the timing. It’s a sign of weakness at a very bad time.\n \n\n   \n  The context of all of this is the   apparent fracturing   of the MAGA base .\n \n\n   \n  That base is arguing over how hard to root out the growing racism and antisemitism in its ranks. Some elements are expressing unease with  how truly “America First”  some facets of Trump’s agenda are — things like bailing out Argentina and threatening to go to war with Venezuela. Others are concerned about how cozy Trump has been with Big Tech.\n \n\n   \n  And the Greene episode has proved a bigger headache for Trump than perhaps anyone anticipated. That’s in large part because, unlike the many moderate Republicans who have bucked him in the past, the Georgia Republican is hitting back against him rather than objecting and meekly fading away. She’s also doing so from a position of credibility with the base.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend we saw a number of prominent MAGA and MAGA-adjacent influencers on social media start to distance themselves from Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Greene seems in some ways to be giving portions of the MAGA base the permission structure to more forcefully object to things they were  previously quietly uneasy about .\n \n\n   \n  And, perhaps not coincidentally, this is also playing out at a time when Trump’s political capital is at a low point.\n \n\n   \n  Republican losses on Election Day this month reinforced Trump’s looming lame-duck status and  crystallized the GOP’s very real problems  in a post-Trump political world, given the party almost always loses when he’s not on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, it shouldn’t be too surprising that some Republicans are trying to figure out what the next chapter looks like and perhaps turn the page on Trump in certain ways. And perhaps on no issue is distancing from Trump an easier call than on the Epstein files;  recent polling  showed Americans disapprove of his administration’s handling of the files 3-to-1 and that 77% want all the files released.\n \n\n   \n  As these numbers show, Trump put congressional Republicans in an impossible position by asking them to toe his line. But it’s still significant that so many of them, for once, actually forced  his  hand.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/africa/gunmen-kidnap-schoolgirls-nigeria-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:15:00-05:00","title":"Gunmen kidnap 25 schoolgirls from Nigerian school, kill vice principal","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a violent attack on the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, Nigeria, gunmen armed with rifles stormed the school at around 4 a.m., killing vice principal Hassan Yakubu Makuku and abducting 25 female students.

Joy Baker said she often sees patients for the first time just weeks or even days before they give birth.\n \n\n   \n  “At least once a week,” a woman may start prenatal care well into their second or third trimester of pregnancy, said Baker, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in LaGrange, Georgia.\n \n\n   \n  “I accept patients up until delivery, and sometimes there are patients that we have not seen at all, and they are in their third trimester, or they’re even 39 weeks,” Baker said. “I’ve done initial prenatal visits at 39 weeks and the patient delivered a week later.”\n \n\n   \n  Starting prenatal care after the first trimester of pregnancy appears to be a growing yet dangerous trend in the United States, according to a new report.\n \n\n   \n  The  report , released Monday by the infant and maternal health nonprofit  March of Dimes , says that only about 75% of babies last year were born to mothers who started prenatal care in   the first trimester of pregnancy.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve always known that getting that prenatal care started early is important,” said Dr. Michael Warren, March of Dimes’ chief medical and health officer. He added that now, in the United States, it’s moving in the “wrong direction.”\n \n\n   \n  “For a quarter of women in this country, the first visit is not happening in the first trimester,” he said, which has been part of a  four-year decline .\n \n\n   \n  Starting prenatal care early is vital because it “gives us the longest possible window to be able to understand how we can best support the health of that pregnant mom, whether it’s addressing chronic diseases that she might have and making sure those are appropriately managed or identifying risk factors,” Warren said.\n \n\n   \n  Warren identified several systemic barriers that are preventing women from starting or maintaining prenatal care. Areas where there is limited or no access to maternity care, known as maternity care deserts, are one major driving force.\n \n\n   \n  More than  a third of counties in the United States  do not have an ob/gyn, a family physician or a certified nurse-midwife. These counties also do not have birthing facilities or centers in hospitals, Warren said.\n \n\n   \n  “Those counties are home to over 2 million women of reproductive age and about 150,000 births every year in the United States,” he said. “If you live in one of those counties, you’re going to have to drive farther to get prenatal care, and when your baby is coming, you have longer to go to be able to find a place that can actually deliver.”\n \n\n   \n    A major risk to mom and baby\n \n\n   \n  The latest findings come as no surprise to Baker.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of times, when I see patients who are second and third trimester, I always ask, ‘What kept you from getting in? What was your barrier?’ They often tell me, ‘I had trouble getting my Medicaid,’ or ‘I was moving around a lot,’ or ‘I had housing insecurity or food insecurity,’” Baker said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a variety of reasons why folks may present late to care,” she said. “But when they have chronic conditions or even conditions that started in the pregnancy – like preeclampsia or gestational diabetes – the earlier that we know, the better we’re able to treat.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s why inadequate or delayed prenatal care can put women at risk of complications or even death, and it plays a big role in the current state of maternal health in the United States, Baker said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a doctor practicing in a small town, I definitely understand that there are often barriers to care for women who have become pregnant,” she said. “There are also barriers to care for women before they become pregnant, which I think may be even more of an issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Addressing these barriers to care remain vital for improving maternal health, she said, adding that care should start well before pregnancy.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the one area where we could really make a plan to prevent severe morbidity and mortality,” she said. “I think this is an area we need to divert more resources to.”\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Baker said, she treated a woman who came to her office for a first prenatal visit at 37 weeks, and the patient had high blood sugar levels.\n \n\n   \n  “We were doing just her initial lab work at 37 weeks, and she had a blood glucose of nearly 300,” Baker said, which was a serious concern for the health of both the mother and the baby. A  blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or above  is typically indicative of diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  “We basically just needed to induce her labor right away because her sugars were so uncontrolled, which was an independent risk factor for stillbirth and a significant risk to her health, as well,” Baker said.\n \n\n   \n  “Had we seen her early and diagnosed her diabetes prior to pregnancy, we could have treated her, helped her control her sugars and significantly reduce the risk to mom and baby,” Baker said. “Consistent, high-quality care would have been a much better experience for her versus walking into the office one day and then being told to report to the hospital for delivery the next.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Nothing … surprised us’\n \n\n   \n  Inadequate prenatal care can often lead to pregnancy or childbirth complications for both the mother and the baby, including preterm birth.\n \n\n   \n   The new March of Dimes report gives the United States a D+ grade for having a preterm birth rate of 10.4% for the third year in a row.\n \n\n   \n  “Sadly, I actually have to say that there was nothing that surprised us” in the new report, said Divya Sooryakumar, the vice president of programs and impact of the maternal health nonprofit Every Mother Counts, who was not involved in the report.\n \n\n   \n  “One thing that I really appreciated about this year’s report was the bifurcation of the impact on preterm birth by insurance type, because that’s something that we’ve seen for a long time,” Sooryakumar said.\n \n\n   \n  She was glad this year’s report “spelled out very clearly how pregnant people on Medicaid are disproportionately impacted by the maternal health care crisis in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  And many women may delay care because they are not sure whether the care will be fully or partially covered by their Medicaid insurance or other insurance providers.\n \n\n   \n  “Where we need to start is reimbursing prenatal care and postpartum care through Medicaid for what it actually costs to do the work. Historically, that work has been chronically under-reimbursed,” Sooryakumar said. “And it creates an incentive for systems and those delivering care to not actually take Medicaid, and then those populations continue to face the brunt of the disparities in the system.”\n \n\n   \n  This gap in adequate care can be seen in preterm birth rates, according to the new March of Dimes report, which says that between 2022 and 2024, the preterm birth rate among mothers with private insurance was 9.6%. Among mothers using Medicaid, it was 11.7%.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid covers more than 40% of births in the United States, Warren said.\n \n\n   \n    Barriers to accessing care\n \n\n   \n  For many women, especially those in maternity care deserts, even getting to a provider can be a major roadblock.\n \n\n   \n  Among its other efforts, the nonprofit organization Every Mother Counts supports a group of midwives in New Mexico who serve indigenous patients. Because of the lack of infrastructure in that area, the group’s radius for care is up to a four-hour drive. Some patients who are in labor or need prenatal care will get in their car and drive those four hours for these appointments, Sooryakumar said.\n \n\n   \n  It also may be difficult for patients to be seen by a provider. “We know that there are all sorts of delays due to workforce shortages and shrinkage,” she said. For instance, a report published last year by the  Association of American Medical Colleges  projects that the nation will face a physician shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036.\n \n\n   \n  Sooryakumar added that the  US Supreme Court’s   Dobbs decision in 2022 , which overturned the right to an abortion, also appears to affect patients’ abilities to see a provider. For instance, some providers in states with more restrictive abortion laws   have turned away patients in the first trimester “because there is a fear that if a patient miscarries, it will be labeled as an abortion or investigated as an abortion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Another barrier to care can be how safe patients feel to seek it, especially among immigrant, mixed-status or undocumented families. “During times of immigration crackdown, that is when families will delay prenatal care,” Sooryakumar said, referring to it as a cycle.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2018, during the era of family separation and especially now, families go into hiding, and what that means is later and later access to prenatal care,” she said. “So what we’ve been seeing, especially over the last few years, is that all three of these factors – getting to a provider, being seen by a provider, and feeling safe, seeking care – are all systematically breaking down at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  Incentive and reporting structures for  Federally Qualified Health Centers , which provide care to underserved communities, can also play a role in delayed care, Sooryakumar added.\n \n\n   \n  These measures are designed to encourage early prenatal care, but an unintended consequence is that some clinics may be less able or less likely to accept patients who arrive later in pregnancy. As a result, women who seek care in the third trimester can be turned away, Sooryakumar said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘That is not acceptable … in 2025’\n \n\n   \n  “Having accessible health care before pregnancy is crucial,” Warren said. “It allows people to receive routine preventive visits, screening for conditions, identification and treatment of chronic diseases.”\n \n\n   \n  Women who have chronic diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity are at “a greater risk for having a baby born preterm,” he said. And that remains a major driving force as to why the highest rates of preterm birth are concentrated in the Southeast.\n \n\n   \n  “The Southeast is one of those areas where we have higher rates of chronic disease, for example. So it’s not surprising that those preterm birth rates are the way they are,” Warren said, adding that this is compounded by a concentration of maternity care deserts in Southeast counties.\n \n\n   \n  But some states have been successful in improving preterm birth rates.\n \n\n   \n  Warren pointed to Tennessee, where there was a high percentage of women who smoked before and during pregnancy. Smoking is a risk factor for preterm birth.\n \n\n   \n  “They really have worked to make it easier for  women to quit smoking  and are doing a combination of educational programs and incentives, and work to make sure that it’s easy for them to quit smoking and that they’re supported in that journey along smoking cessation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Research has associated the state’s smoking cessation program for pregnant women with  better pregnancy outcomes , including a significantly reduced risk of having an infant with a low birth weight.\n \n\n   \n  In the Midwest, Illinois recognized that pregnant women may often face challenges such as poverty or housing and food insecurity, which can impact their access to care.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve instituted  case management programs  where they actually have folks who will work with women during pregnancy, particularly women who are at high risk of having worse pregnancy outcomes,” Warren said.\n \n\n   \n  But to address the overall maternal health crisis, Warren said, there must be a national effort to ensure that women have insurance coverage across their lives and the country must “maintain a really robust public health infrastructure.”\n \n\n   \n  He warned that should the trend of inadequate prenatal care continue, more mothers will not be there to celebrate their babies’ first birthdays.\n \n\n   \n  “Every year in this country, we lose over 20,000 babies in [the] first year of life. We lose over 600 moms, either during pregnancy or delivery, or during that first year postpartum,” Warren said. “That is not acceptable in the United States in 2025, and unless we change our course, those numbers are not going to get better. They’re going to get worse.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/uk/britain-asylum-reform-shabana-mahmood-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"13:03:00-05:00","title":"Britain announces ‘most significant’ change to asylum rules in years, setting Europe’s longest route to settlement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK government, under the Labour administration, has announced a major overhaul of its asylum policy, introducing the most significant reform in decades. The policy makes refugee status temporary, ending the automatic right to permanent settlement after five years and extending the wait to 20 years—making it the longest in Europe. Refugees will be returned to their home countries if their nation becomes safe during this period. Support such as housing and weekly allowances will be withdrawn for those who have the right to work but fail to comply. The government is also restricting interpretations of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, limiting family reunification to immediate family members.

to settlement \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:03 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Britain  plans to carry out the most significant reform of its asylum policy in modern times by making refugee status temporary and quadrupling the wait for permanent settlement to 20 years, as the  Labour government  confronts a “broken” asylum system that has fueled support for right-wing parties.\n \n\n   \n  After a summer of protests outside  hotels  housing asylum seekers, a mass anti-immigration demonstration in  London , and constant criticism from the surging hard-right  Reform UK party , the government unveiled plans to curb illegal small-boat crossings from France and return refugees to their home countries when it is safe to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain’s asylum system – created in the wake of World War II – was not designed to cope with modern flows of people across a conflict-ridden world.\n \n\n   \n  “The world has changed. It is more volatile and insecure,” Starmer said Monday. “The result is a severe strain on both our asylum system and our wider social contract.” He insisted that Britain remains a “decent, compassionate, tolerant country,” but said demonstrating control of borders is an “essential task of government.”\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood had previously teased the measures in a weekend media blitz.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a system that is out of control,” she told the BBC on Sunday. “It’s unfair, and it’s putting huge pressure on communities. It is important that we restore order and control to this system, so that we can retain public permission and public confidence in having an asylum system at all.”\n \n\n   \n  The government’s plan has three main prongs. First, ending the “automatic path” to settled status after a refugee has been in Britain for five years. Under the changes, a refugee’s status will now be reviewed every two-and-a-half years during a 20-year wait before they can apply for permanent settlement.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said this measure will upend the “generations-old assumption” that sanctuary provided to refugees can quickly lead to settled status “and all of the rights that go alongside that.”\n \n\n   \n  “If your country becomes safe in the intervening period… you will be returned to your country,” Mahmood stressed. Those who arrive legally will also face a 10-year pathway to permanent settlement, double the current wait.\n \n\n   \n  Second, housing and weekly allowances will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to. Those who break the law will also have their support withdrawn. Mahmood said: “It is not fair if British citizens and long-term residents in this country have to follow one set of rules and comply, and another group of people – who also have the right to work – get away with not complying.”\n \n\n   \n  Third, the government will narrow the way that British courts interpret Article 8 in the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees all people the right to a family life. But the government said that people using wider familial links as a reason to stay in or bring others to Britain is leading to “high numbers of arrivals” from those who would not otherwise have the right to live in the country. The government wants to stipulate that “family connections” must refer to immediate family members.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Monday, Jonathan Sumption, a former UK Supreme Court judge, warned that if Britain interprets one of the articles in a different way to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, it could be judged to be in violation of the treaty. Sumption said the conflict poses a “constitutional problem” for the UK.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy takes inspiration from Denmark’s approach, one of the toughest in Europe. But Britain is now poised to go further: The new 20-year route would make Britain’s path to settlement the longest in Europe, followed by Denmark’s eight-year process.\n \n\n   \n  Since winning a landslide election in 2024, Labour has tried to tread a line between showing competence in tackling illegal immigration, without alienating its more progressive voter base which favors a more compassionate approach.\n \n\n   \n   Both sides have been left alienated:  Right-wing voters support the more drastic measures proposed by Nigel Farage, the firebrand leader of Reform UK, while many on the left have been alarmed by Labour’s tough talk.\n \n\n   \n  But Mahmood, herself the daughter of immigrants from the Pakistani side of Kashmir, said she rejected “the idea that dealing with this problem is somehow engaging with far-right talking points.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart. It is dividing communities. People can see huge pressure in their communities and they can also see a system that is broken, and where people are able to flout the rules, abuse the system, and get away with it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The Home Secretary also criticized the previous Conservative government for wasting time and public funds in its failed efforts to tackle illegal immigration. The Conservatives passed a contentious bill allowing the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be processed by the East African nation, but Mahmood said this cost £700 million ($920) and saw only four people deported – all volunteers.\n \n\n   \n  In a measure of the hardening of Britain’s debate around immigration, other mainstream parties did not forcefully criticize Labour’s plans. Chris Philp, who used to be a Conservative Home Office minister, told the BBC his party would support the new measures if they are “sensible,” while claiming the measures aren’t “radical” enough.\n \n\n   \n  Ed Davey, leader of the more progressive Liberal Democrats, also said Labour is right to announce asylum measures to “tackle the chaos.”\n \n\n   \n    The Denmark model\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s new policy draws inspiration from Denmark and other European countries where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration is expected.\n \n\n   \n  In a video on X, Mahmood said she was taking action because asylum claims are rising in Britain despite falling across other parts of Europe. “In the last four years, 400,000 people claimed asylum here,” she said. “Over 100,000 are housed and supported at taxpayers’ expense, putting huge pressure on local communities.”\n \n\n   \n  The Home Office says that Denmark’s policies have reduced asylum claims there to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of rejected applicants. Earlier this year, a UK delegation of senior Home Office officials visited the capital of Copenhagen to study Denmark’s approach to asylum, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  However, its reforms have  drawn significant criticism , with rights groups saying the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Refugee Council criticized the government’s new policy announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “People who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars are not ‘asylum shopping’… refugees don’t compare asylum systems before running for their lives,” the group wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  “We know why people come to the UK: because they already have family here, they speak some English, or they have long-standing ties that help them rebuild their lives in safety,” the group added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"13:23:00-05:00","title":"Invest in crypto?

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:23 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by January 30, 2026 in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2026 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-novo-nordisk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:54:00-05:00","title":"Novo Nordisk further lowers prices for weight loss, diabetes drugs for those who pay cash","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Novo Nordisk has announced reduced prices for its GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic for self-pay customers, offering the first two doses at $199 and monthly pricing of $349, down from $499, to combat competition from compounding pharmacies and to respond to consumer demand for affordability.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:54 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Facing increased competition in the weight loss market and intense pressure from  President Donald Trump , Novo Nordisk announced Monday that it is lowering prices for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs for cash-paying patients.\n \n\n   \n  The move is the latest step in drugmakers’ efforts to provide discounts to Americans willing to buy medications directly from them and forgo insurance. Also, it’s another way Novo Nordisk is seeking to fend off compounding pharmacies that are cutting into the manufacturer’s sales by offering less-expensive versions of the super-popular GLP-1 drugs.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk is now offering the first two monthly doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199, with the discount expiring at the end of March. It applies to the two lowest doses of the medication.\n \n\n   \n  Also, the drugmaker is reducing the prices of Wegovy and Ozempic for other self-pay patients to $349 a month, down from $499 a month. (The 2-milligram dose of Ozempic will continue to cost $499.)\n \n\n   \n  The discounts are available for self-paying customers who use the company’s direct-to-consumer channels and through Novo Nordisk’s various partners, including Costco, GoodRx and Weight Watchers, in addition to more than 70,000 retail pharmacies.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes shortly after the drugmaker, along with rival Eli Lilly, announced a  major deal  with the Trump administration that will broaden their access to the Medicare and Medicaid markets in exchange for reducing their prices.\n \n\n   \n  Under the agreement, consumers buying injectable GLP-1 medications directly from the companies will pay an average of $350 per month to start, though the drugmakers have committed to reducing the price to about $250 over the next two years. If oral GLP-1 tablets are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, the lowest dose will cost $149.\n \n\n   \n  These prices will be available when TrumpRx, the administration’s direct-to-consumer online platform, launches in early 2026.\n \n\n   \n  List prices for GLP-1 drugs range from around $1,000 to about $1,350, but consumers with insurance coverage for the medicines typically pay much less.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk is counting on its self-pay channel to help boost sales in the US, as well as abroad. The cash market accounts for about 10% of total Wegovy prescriptions in the US, said Dave Moore, executive vice president of US operations.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of interest in direct pay, self-pay,” Moore told CNN. “We know that’s an interest of people living with obesity.”\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes as it faces increased pressure from Eli Lilly and compounding pharmacies, Evan Seigerman, a pharmaceutical analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The reduced self-pay price for starter doses of Ozempic and Wegovy are closer to those available from compounding pharmacies and much lower than the cash price of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, he said. (Starter doses of Zepound cost $349 a month through Eli Lilly’s direct-to-consumer channel, while higher doses are priced at $499 a month.)\n \n\n   \n  Novo’s move on pricing “likely reflects a reaction to Novo’s softening market share as the company looks to regain its footing,” Seigerman wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 1 in 8 adults say they currently use a GLP-1 drug such as Ozempic or Wegovy to lose weight or treat a chronic condition, according to a  KFF Health Tracking Poll  released Friday. About a quarter of people who have used the drugs and have health insurance said they paid the full cost themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Among those who have ever used GLP-1 drugs, cost is among the most commonly cited reasons for stopping, the poll found.\n \n\n   \n  Although insurers broadly cover Ozempic as a treatment for diabetes, coverage of Wegovy for weight loss is much spottier, in part because of the drug’s price. Wegovy’s list price is $1,349 a month, although those with insurance coverage typically pay far less.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk also launched its direct-to-consumer pharmacy this year, offering Wegovy for $499 a month. In August, it began  selling Ozempic  at half-price, $499, to patients who pay cash.\n \n\n   \n  Eli Lilly has also  slashed the price  of its GLP-1 weight loss drug, Zepbound, for self-pay patients.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/supreme-court-trump-asylum-seekers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court to Review Rescinded Trump Policy of Turning Away Asylum Seekers at the Border","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to review the controversial 'metering' policy from 2018, during which asylum seekers were turned back in Mexico before entering the U.S. The policy, originally enacted under President Donald Trump, was challenged by immigrant rights group Al Otro Lado and asylum seekers, with a 9th Circuit court ruling that federal law requires inspection of individuals who arrive at U.S. ports of entry.

Supreme Court to review rescinded Trump policy of turning away asylum seekers at the border \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:47 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Supreme Court  announced Monday that it will review a controversial immigration policy adopted during the first Trump administration of turning away potential asylum seekers before they step foot on American soil, setting up the first major immigration policy case of the term.\n \n\n   \n  Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump’s first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US.\n \n\n   \n  An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. An appeals court based in San Francisco sided with the migrants, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in July.\n \n\n   \n  The practical impact of the litigation, at least for now, is limited at best. The Biden administration  rescinded “metering”  and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. Because of that, Al Otro Lado argued that the case “has almost no present implications, and likely no future implications either.”\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration balked at that reasoning, telling the Supreme Court that “this administration and future administrations should retain the option of reviving that practice when border conditions justify doing so.”\n \n\n   \n  In that sense, the fact that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case was already a win for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  A divided 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law requires border agencies to inspect asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry, even if they did not enter the country. In its appeal to the high court, the Trump administration argued that cannot be right.\n \n\n   \n  “In ordinary English, a person ‘arrives in’ a country only when he comes within its borders,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “An alien thus does not ‘arrive in’ the United States while he is still in Mexico.”\n \n\n   \n  But the groups supporting Al Otro Lado said that reading would make a mockery of the asylum process, empowering officials to render “inspection and asylum processing requirements wholly inoperable at ports of entry – the designated places where noncitizens may lawfully come into the United States – by simply blocking asylum seekers from stepping on U.S. soil.”\n \n\n   \n  The court will hear arguments in the case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with more details on the case. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00.000-05:00","title":"Women face a much higher risk of homicide, especially from guns, during pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the United States face a significantly elevated risk of homicide, particularly from firearms, with a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than non-pregnant women of childbearing age.

guns, during pregnancy \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:56 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On April 9, 2020, after Shirley Scarborough made her daily call to a prayer line, she went to work and got another call: from the police department in Richmond, Virginia. Her youngest daughter, Francesca Harris-Scarborough, had been killed the night before.\n \n\n   \n  Police had found the 31-year-old’s car still idling. Scarborough’s daughter, who was three months pregnant, had been shot twice in the heart.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t ready for it. I lost control of everything,” Scarborough said. “Everything went blank.”\n \n\n   \n  Francesca was part of a terrible trend in the United States: Homicide is the No. 1 way pregnant women die,  research  has  showed , but a new  study  finds that they are even more vulnerable than other women of childbearing age when there’s a gun involved.\n \n\n   \n  The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at more than 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 and 2021. Pregnant women were found to have a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than women who weren’t pregnant, and more than two-thirds of pregnancy-associated homicides involved firearms.\n \n\n   \n  The presence of a firearm is known to be a key risk factor of intimate partner homicide. The new study showed that every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership was associated with a 6% increase in all-cause homicide and an 8% increase in the firearm-specific homicide rate in pregnant women, even after adjusting for other factors.\n \n\n   \n  “Even incremental increases in firearm availability may contribute to measurable increases in homicide risk in pregnant women,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really not surprising, if you think about it, that if firearms are more available, then that certainly it does increase your risk of homicide in general,” said study co-author Dr. Lois Lee, a senior faculty adviser in the Office and Health Equity & Inclusion and an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. “So you could imagine, if you take away or at least decrease the number of firearms, then there would likely be many fewer deaths during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  “And unlike medical conditions, which, yes, we do have many medical advances and can save many lives, but in some ways, those conditions are much less preventable, like eclampsia and sepsis,” Lee added. “This is predictable and potentially preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The highest proportion of homicides in pregnant women was among those 20 to 24 years old. Among women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicide victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors recommend safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Although most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books, said Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, who was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually, the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow-up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multidisciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement and court administrators who serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit. It scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm.\n \n\n   \n  According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughter’s journals after her death, Scarborough said, she realized that although her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that began when she was younger. Scarborough also started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence. Scarborough also  wrote about her own experience  in her memoir “Shattered But Not Destroyed A Mother’s Journey from Heartbreak to Hope.” She said she hopes it can help readers find strength and purpose, even when life is at its most difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Scarborough hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die. We can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher. It’s changed my life. It will never be the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/food/target-starbucks-exclusive-drink-launch","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:39:00-05:00","title":"Target and Starbucks Team Up on Exclusive Holiday Drink to Boost Sales","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Target and Starbucks are launching a limited-time holiday collaboration featuring an exclusive Frozen Peppermint Hot Chocolate drink available only at Starbucks locations inside Target stores.

They’re teaming up on an exclusive new drink \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:39 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two of America’s most embattled retail chains are working together to drum up some excitement from customers this holiday season. They sure could use it.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning Monday, a Frozen Peppermint Hot Chocolate drink will be available exclusively at Starbucks cafés inside Target stores. The vast majority of Target’s 2,000 locations include a Starbucks, but this marks the first-ever holiday drink collaboration between the two companies.\n \n\n   \n  Retailers have been under immense pressure this year as inflation and tariffs drive  consumer sentiment near record lows . A number of consumer brands said on their quarterly earnings calls with Wall Street analysts that low-income consumers in particular are growing increasingly cost-sensitive, and they’re cutting back on non-essentials.\n \n\n   \n  That trend has hit Target and  Starbucks  particularly hard: Target, because it specializes in discretionary items, including impulse buys and home decor; and Starbucks, because it sells expensive drinks that consumers has perceived to be lower value than a wide array of hipper coffee chains and cheaper alternatives.\n \n\n   \n  Target is also contending with two consecutive quarters of slumping foot traffic, partly because of backlash over its  reversal on diversity, equity and inclusion programs . Plus, Starbucks’ new CEO is one year into his turnaround plan but is closing stores, laying off employees and facing ongoing strikes from disgruntled workers.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, the two brands hope the fandom around Starbucks’ specialty drinks is strong enough to lure customers into Target stores during the all-important holiday shopping season.\n \n\n   \n  The Frappuccino-based drink is positioned to be the “perfect companion for holiday shopping runs,” Target said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The exclusive drink is “part of a strategy to inject a bit more novelty back into the store experience,” Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CNN. “We also know that consumers love exclusive menu items, particularly in beverages, so this could nudge people into visiting Target just to try the drink.”\n \n\n   \n  Prices for the drink start at $5.95 for a grande size. Members of Target’s paid  loyalty program  can buy it Monday before it’s available to the public on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The beverage is just one of the ways Target is trying to attract customers to stores in November and December: It’s also hosting in-store toy, makeup and tech demonstrations  scattered  throughout the two months. Employees are also  reportedly  being told to smile more at shoppers in an attempt to make the stores   feel more welcoming.\n \n\n   \n  Target ( TGT ) reports earnings Wednesday. The company announced last month that it laid off around  1,000 corporate employees . Sales have fallen for three consecutive quarters, and the stock has lost more than a third of its value this year.\n \n\n   \n  Saunders doesn’t think an exclusive drink alone will “move the foot-traffic dial in a major way,” he said. But, he added, “every little bit helps,” – especially since Target needs it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/indiana-redistricting-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00-05:00","title":"Trump Ramps Up the Pressure on Republicans Resisting His Redistricting Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump and his allies, including the Club for Growth and Fair Maps Indiana — staffed by former Trump aides — are intensifying pressure on Republican lawmakers in Indiana to support redistricting to create more GOP-friendly congressional seats.

11:41 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans in Indiana have for months been hearing conflicting messages: Demands to join the nationwide redistricting arms race from President Donald Trump’s administration and his allies – and nearly unanimous opposition to the idea from their constituents, even in deep-red districts that back the president.\n \n\n   \n  Groups pushing for redistricting funded TV ads, texts, videos and robocalls demanding that state senators redraw US House maps to create one or two more Republican-friendly seats. One state senator reported “extremely negative” messages going out across her district, including to her 14-year-old grandson.\n \n\n   \n  That push hit a wall on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray  announced there weren’t enough votes  in his chamber, even with a GOP supermajority, to return in December for a special session to consider redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  What became clear in the lead-up to Bray’s announcement was that the pressure campaign launched by Trump’s allies — including the Club for Growth and Fair Maps Indiana, a newly formed group staffed by former Trump aides and led by veteran Indiana Republican operative Marty Obst — hadn’t helped and might even have backfired.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans pushing for Indiana to redistrict didn’t back down after Bray’s announcement. Trump on Sunday took to Truth Social to attack Bray and another Indiana Republican senator, Greg Goode, who had not taken a public position on redistricting, but held a town hall in Terre Haute that revealed the intense opposition of attendees and relative lack of a groundswell of support for new congressional lines.\n \n\n   \n  “Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans, led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode, for not wanting to redistrict their State, allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats,” Trump said, referring to them as “Republicans in name only.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump reiterated the threat to oust Republican state senators who opposed redistricting in primaries — even though some of the eight who took public positions against drawing new lines, including Bray, aren’t on the ballot again until 2028.\n \n\n   \n  He said the GOP “must keep the Majority at all costs.”\n \n\n   \n  But Rob Kendall, an influential conservative talk radio host on WIBC in Indianapolis, said that “all these social media influencers barking” weren’t going to instill fear in lawmakers who hadn’t seen a groundswell of support for redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s the case? You’re going to knock on the door and say, ‘You should vote this senator out because he did what his constituents wanted?’” Kendall said.\n \n\n   \n  He said part of why voters in the deep-red state didn’t rally behind redistricting is that they’d watched Indiana lawmakers fail to sufficiently address rising property taxes earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “But they’ll move heaven and earth to help Republicans pick up two seats in Congress,” Kendall said. “And people are saying, wait a second — you won’t do anything to help me, but you’ll do all this to help your party. I think that rubbed people the wrong way.”\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Goode’s home was swatted, Goode and Vigo County Sheriff Derek Fell both said. Swatting is a  false report made to authorities  with the express purpose of luring them to a location — usually a home — where they are led to believe a horrific crime has been committed or is in progress.\n \n\n   \n  Fell said in a statement posted on Facebook that sheriff’s deputies responded Sunday evening to an email sent to the Terre Haute Police Department “advising harm had been done to persons inside a home, located in southeastern Vigo County.” He added: “Investigation showed that this was a prank or false email (also known as ‘swatting’).”\n \n\n   \n  “Our office along with federal authorities will investigate this incident with every intention of discovering who is responsible,” Fell said.\n \n\n   \n    Redistricting supporters aren’t backing down\n \n\n   \n  The drama over whether Indiana would join the growing list of states to redraw their congressional maps offered a window into the pressure Republicans face to follow Trump’s wishes.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance visited the state twice to make the case to Gov. Mike Braun and legislative leaders and met with lawmakers who had been invited to the White House. National Republicans took to social media to threaten primary challenges to Republicans who failed to support redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Any Republican that votes against this important redistricting, potentially having an impact on America itself, should be PRIMARIED,” Trump said on his social media platform Sunday. He suggested Braun “perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.”\n \n\n   \n  Braun, who had called the special session, said in a statement that he wasn’t backing down.\n \n\n   \n  “I called for our legislators to convene to ensure Hoosiers’ voices in Washington, DC, are not diluted by the democrats’ gerrymandering,” Braun said in a statement. “Our state senators need to do the right thing and show up to vote for fair maps. Hoosiers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on important issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Supporters and opponents of redistricting agreed before Bray’s announcement on where things stood. The House would vote to approve new maps intended to turn the state’s 7-to-2, Republican-to-Democrat congressional delegation into one that is 8-to-1 or 9-to-0. But the fate of a new congressional map was much less clear in the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  Braun, the Indiana Republican Party and the state’s entire GOP congressional delegation have endorsed redistricting. But they’ve also made clear it wasn’t their idea and haven’t sought to force individual legislators’ hands. It’s a stark contrast with Kansas, another state Trump-world is eyeing for redistricting, where the Republican House speaker has stripped three Republicans of their committee chairmanships for refusing to back new congressional lines there.\n \n\n   \n  Longtime Republican Sen. Jean Leising, who represents a deep-red, rural swath of southeastern Indiana, said in an earlier statement she was opposed to redistricting because her constituents were “overwhelmingly opposed” to redistricting. But Leising was also incensed by the campaign to pressure her.\n \n\n   \n  “Some have even been sent via cell phone to students in my district, including my 14-year-old grandson,” she said. “These groups do not have the best interest of my rural area or the state of Indiana at heart, and their methods are completely unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Leising said only 6% of her constituents supported redistricting. Other senators shared similar numbers, based on the contacts their offices had received. Republican Sen. Kyle Walker — who is also the executive vice president of Obst’s political consulting firm and a member of the Indiana Republican Party State Committee — said in a statement Thursday he would vote against redistricting because 93% of his constituents opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  In a town hall earlier this month, Goode heard from 71 attendees who opposed redistricting and none who supported it, The Indianapolis Star  reported .\n \n\n   \n    A debate with huge midterm consequences\n \n\n   \n  Democrats need to gain just three seats in the US House after next year’s midterms to take control of the chamber and potentially block parts of Trump’s agenda during the final two years of his White House term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the mid-decade redistricting arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to create five additional GOP-friendly seats. So far, GOP-led mapmaking efforts have redrawn seats in four states – Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio – to add a total of nine potential seats to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Californians voted by a large margin to approve five additional Democratic-friendly districts, which represents the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state. The Justice Department has since gone to court to try to invalidate the California referendum.\n \n\n   \n  With Virginia Democrats also moving to consider redistricting and produce two or three Democratic-leaning seats, Republicans could end up with a wash nationally unless other GOP-led states act to create more friendly seats.\n \n\n   \n  Hours before Bray issued his statement, Club for Growth President David McIntosh told CNN that his group was “working with the leadership in the Senate” to try to persuade undecided senators to back redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  McIntosh said Bray and Senate leaders are “being careful and cautious, as they should be,” as they try to get the votes necessary to pass new maps.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what they’ll do is bring it up, have more discussion among the Republican senators, and I’m confident in the end they’ll convince people of the view that I have: that really, Republicans need to step up and do this,” he said. “They shouldn’t be afraid of the bad press they might get or their Democratic colleagues getting mad at them.”\n \n\n   \n  Obst, who launched Fair Maps Indiana, said the group he is leading also includes Trump 2024 senior adviser Chris LaCivita, as well as political consultant Chip Englander and Trump ad man John Brabender.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a shame Sen. Bray blocked the special session,” Obst said Friday. “It’s clear he does not support President Trump’s agenda. Senators should show up and do their jobs and vote on redistricting.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Like elections, decisions have consequences. I anticipate those consequences to be severe.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/media/sky-sports-womens-tiktok-account-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-05:00","title":"Sky Sports ditches new women’s TikTok account after viewers brand it ‘sexist’ and ‘patronizing’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sky Sports launched a new TikTok account named 'Halo,' branded as 'Sky Sports’ lil sis,' aiming to create a space for young female sports fans through content seen through a female lens.

CNN was unable to independently verify the videos.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than creating a “welcoming community for female sports fans” as Gill’s LinkedIn post said the company intended, posting content like this only perpetuated stereotypes about female sports fans, hundreds of TikTok, Reddit and X users said.\n \n\n   \n  And by using such a distinctive aesthetic, Sky inadvertently created a TikTok template with which other users could mock it. Suddenly, the platform was flooded with viral clips of sport, complete with pink, sparkly, tongue-in-cheek captions laid over them.\n \n\n   \n  “thank you sky sports halo, I’ve finally understood why I couldn’t understand football before. It’s bc (because) there was no pink writing on screen with loads of girlie emojis,” one user wrote over a video of England’s Lionesses playing Brazil last month, set to Aqua’s 1997 song “Barbie Girl.”\n \n\n   \n  “Scrums and matcha is for the girly pops,” Harlequins rugby player Orla Proctor wrote over a clip   of England taking on New Zealand on Saturday, with Hello Kitty, pink ribbon and matcha emojis for added emphasis.\n \n\n   \n  Sky Sports declined CNN’s request for further comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/europe/poland-train-track-ukraine-aid-sabotage-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00-05:00","title":"Polish train track that helped transport aid to Ukraine destroyed in ‘act of sabotage,’ prime minister says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A train track between Warsaw and Lublin in Poland was destroyed in what Prime Minister Donald Tusk called an 'unprecedented act of sabotage' involving an explosive device, severely disrupting the rail line crucial for transporting humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:53 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A train track between the Polish cities of Warsaw and Lublin was destroyed in an “unprecedented act of sabotage” over the weekend, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk  said Monday , noting that the railway is “crucially important for delivering aid to Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  An “explosive device” blew up the rail track on Sunday, Tusk said in a  post on X , adding separately that the attack “directly (targeted) the security of the Polish state and its civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  Destruction was also identified along the same route further down the railway line, he said.\n \n\n   \n  At a press conference Monday afternoon, Poland’s interior minister Marcin Kierwiński said that two separate incidents took place over the weekend – one confirmed act of sabotage, and one that was deemed “highly probable” to be sabotage. No arrests have been made so far in relation to the incidents.\n \n\n   \n  Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said that threats to Europe’s security are “real and growing.” The continent “must urgently boost capacity to protect our skies and our infrastructure,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Estonia’s Prime Minister Kristen Michal strongly condemned the damage to the train track,  writing on X  that his country stands with Poland.\n \n\n   \n  “Those behind hostile acts against (European Union) and NATO members must be exposed. Our response must be united,” Michal said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also offered his country’s solidarity with Poland, offering support if needed and suggesting that Russia could have played a part in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope investigation will provide answers and we also stand ready to assist if called upon,” Sybiha said. “Could have been another hybrid attack by Russia - to test responses. If true, they need to be strong.”\n \n\n   \n  Tusk vowed that his country “will catch the perpetrators, whoever they are,” without saying who he believed was responsible for the damage.\n \n\n   \n  The explosion, which did not cause any injuries according to Tusk, is the latest in a string of incidents in Europe that have left the continent on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  Several European nations have reported incursions into their airspace in recent months, with most pointing the finger at Russia. The Kremlin has denied involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, the European Commission adopted stricter rules on issuing visas to Russian nationals, citing safety risks related to Russia’s war on Ukraine as the reason for doing this.\n \n\n   \n  “We now face unprecedented drone disruptions and sabotage on our soil. We have a duty to protect our citizens,” Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  A research paper by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggested that Russia is carrying out a “campaign of sabotage, vandalism, espionage and covert action” to destabilize European governments.\n \n\n   \n  Incidents within this alleged campaign include the deliberate damaging of undersea cables, the targeting of telecommunications towers and arson plots,  IISS said .\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the outlet Polsat News on Sunday, Poland’s Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Duszczyk said that his country has been confronted with varying acts of sabotage for some time, according to the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n \n\n   \n  Last year, an  enormous fire  destroyed a shopping center in Warsaw. Polish authorities announced in May that this was the result of arson ordered by Russian intelligence services, though Russia had previously denied allegations of orchestrating arson and sabotage operations across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  While “someone must have damaged” the train track, Duszczyk said, he also warned against immediately assigning the blame to Russia, PAP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia is not so powerful that every arson, every situation of this type, is provoked by Russia. However, this cannot be ruled out or underestimated in any way,” he said, according to PAP.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Internal Security Agency is working alongside police, the prosecutor’s office and railway services to investigate the matter, Polish politician Tomasz Siemoniak  said on X .\n \n\n   \n  Poland’s National Security Committee will hold a meeting on Tuesday morning, with military commanders, heads of services and the president’s representative in attendance, Tusk said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/venezuela-trump-military-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"08:49:00.000Z","title":"Trump Suggests Decision on Venezuela Military Operations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has indicated he has made a decision on potential military operations in Venezuela after receiving multiple high-level briefings from U.S. defense and national security officials.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:49 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump suggested he has made up his mind on a course of action in Venezuela following multiple  high-level briefings  last week and a mounting US  show of force  in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Officials briefed Trump last week on options for military operations inside Venezuela, four sources told CNN, as he weighs the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign to potentially  oust President Nicolás Maduro . The US military, meanwhile, has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded “Operation Southern Spear.”\n \n\n   \n  In another sign of increasing tensions, the US announced Sunday that it will designate a Venezuelan cartel as a  foreign terrorist organization , which Trump suggested would allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The president indicated Friday he was drawing closer to a path forward on his attempts to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — and the possibility of regime change.\n \n\n   \n  “I sort of have made up my mind — yeah. I mean, I can’t tell you what it would be, but I sort of have,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked directly about those meetings and whether he had made a decision.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told reporters Sunday, however, that the US may have discussions with Maduro, adding Venezuela “would like to talk.”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump been briefed on?\n \n\n   \n  A small group, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, briefed the president on Wednesday. A larger national security team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top officials, met with Trump in the Situation Room on Thursday, according to a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team reviewed target options during both meetings.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including air strikes on military or government facilities and drug-trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine production facilities and drug-trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action. Trump said last month he had  authorized the CIA  to operate in the country, but administration officials  told lawmakers this month  that the US didn’t have a legal justification that would support attacks against any land targets — though it is possible they could generate one. Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  The president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n    What assets are in the region?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,   the US has amassed its naval forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration has launched  at least 20 strikes  on alleged drug-trafficking boats, an effort officials say is meant to disrupt the flow of drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the region last week and entered the Caribbean Sea on Sunday, the Navy announced.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself — described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform” — the US has amassed roughly 15,000 military personnel in the region, alongside more than a dozen warships, including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship, amphibious assault vessels, and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that the US military “would be ready, if asked” to take action in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “The president and secretary of war have spent a lot of time thinking about what is the best thing they can do for the American people. And I can speak from the Army’s perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world,” Driscoll said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts describe the level of military buildup as significant.\n \n\n   \n  “I have been surprised by both the scale and the speed, and it is unprecedented,” Eric Farnsworth, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN. “It’s the most significant build up this century. In fact, you have to go back to 1989, the US invasion of Panama, for anything remotely similar.”\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela, in turn, has said  it is launching  a “massive mobilization” of military personnel, weapons and equipment.\n \n\n   \n    Potential risks and rewards\n \n\n   \n  Regime change in Venezuela would require serious commitment by the US and carries high risk, but ousting Maduro could give Trump and his team credit for something that has proved elusive to multiple US administrations, including his own.\n \n\n   \n  During  his first term in office , Trump officially recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader, but a failed coup attempt in 2019 meant Guaidó never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump ousted Maduro, the US president could claim major wins: getting a strongman out and an elected leader in, the possibility of enhanced collaboration on flows of drugs and migration, and potential deals on oil.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have also warned that if Trump ordered strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, the US president could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency.\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Caracas on Friday, Maduro warned that US military intervention could lay the groundwork for what he described as “another Gaza,” a “new Afghanistan” or “Vietnam again.”\n \n\n   \n  Offering a direct message to the US, he said, “Stop the insane hand of those who order bombing, killing and bringing war to South America, to the Caribbean. Stop the war. No to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Extended US military involvement also runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars. Both Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth served in the military during the Iraq War and have since expressed skepticism about entangling the US in foreign conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/travel/thanksgiving-travel-government-shutdown-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:33:00-05:00","title":"What travelers need to know about Thanksgiving flights","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown ends on November 17, 2025, flight disruptions related to staffing shortages and emergency flight cuts are expected to resolve.

17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when 6 million Americans are expected to head to airports across the country, according to AAA figures.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history came to an end Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Mandatory cuts to flights at 40 major airports ended on Monday morning, when a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order was lifted.\n \n\n   \n  “The flight reduction emergency order will be terminated on Monday, November 17 at 6 a.m. This means normal operations can resume across the National Airspace System,” said a Sunday joint statement from US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. The staffing shortages triggered the FAA order to reduce flights incrementally. The flight cuts began on November 7 and were set to increase gradually up to 10%, but they stopped at 6% with the end of the shutdown. The cuts were reduced to 3% of flights over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy said last week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would “allow U.S. airlines to restore their operations ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday.”\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian feels optimistic about a swift recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” Bastian told  “CBS Mornings” on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Andy Rose, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:11:00-05:00","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 83","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted 21 strikes between September 2 and November 15, 2025, killing 83 people and destroying 22 boats in an operation described by the Trump administration as an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels.

Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:11 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 83 people in 21 strikes that have destroyed 22 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean.

However, Sinner had to step up and save set point at 5-6 with a booming 117 miles-per-hour second serve, going on to force the tiebreak.\n \n\n   \n  From there, the Italian took firm control after several backhand errors from Alcaraz – who had to receive treatment on his right thigh during the match – opened the door for Sinner to take the first set.\n \n\n   \n  The start of the second set went awry for the defending champion as he served two double faults to give the Spaniard an early break, but Sinner got his own break in the sixth game to bring it back to serve.\n \n\n   \n  With the loud Italian crowd behind him, Sinner proceeded to save another break point in the seventh game before going on to break Alcaraz in the decider, dropping to the court in celebration after confirming the victory.\n \n\n   \n  With the win, Sinner has now lifted the trophy at the last two ATP Finals without dropping a set all tournament and became just the fourth man to defend the year-end title since 2001, joining Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Lleyton Hewitt.\n \n\n   \n  After the final, Sinner gave credit to his team and to his partner in the “Sincaraz” rivalry: “We are individual athletes, but without my team, this is not possible. Celebrating this trophy at the end of the year after such an intense last couple of months, there is no better ending.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very, very close match. I saved a set point in the first set and I am extremely happy with how I handled the situation and it means the world to me.\n \n\n   \n  “It was tough today. Playing against Carlos, you have to play at your best. I was serving very well at times, but he is one of the best returners in the game. … I am very happy. It was a tough match, but it means a lot to me ending the season like this. It is amazing.”\n \n\n   \n  Alcaraz, who will remain the year-end world No. 1 despite the loss, praised Sinner after the match but also lobbed a friendly warning ahead of the 2026 season: “It is a great year for Jannik and now time to rest.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope you are going to be ready for next year because I will be ready.

\nUpdated: \n        8:45 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukraine will purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France, the Elysee Palace confirmed, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Paris on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We will have the greatest air defense system, one of the greatest in the world,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after signing the letter of intent with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Villacoublay Air Force Base southwest of Paris on Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference, Zelensky told reporters that the deal would include eight air defense systems and six launchers in what he described as an “historic agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  Macron said that some of the deliveries of drones, interceptor drones and guided bombs, would come in the “very short term” with manufacturing commitments made for the coming three years. The Elysee Palace said that the purchases covered by the letter of intent would span the next 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  Macron said that Ukraine will receive a “new generation” of the SAMP/T missile interceptor – largely comparable to the US-made Patriot system – which will be available in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Questioned over the financing of the deal, Zelensky said Ukraine was examining the possible co-production of the French-made jets.\n \n\n   \n    Good friends\n \n\n   \n  This was Zelensky’s ninth visit to Paris since the 2022 Russian invasion, as France has become a central pillar of Western support for Ukraine, particularly given the unpredictability of US weapons supplies.\n \n\n   \n  In a powerful show of Franco-Ukrainian military cooperation, the leaders inked the agreement in front of a Rafale jet loaded up with guided AASM bombs and beside a SCALP cruise missile that Paris has already supplied to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders were flanked by a SAMP/T missile interceptor system and a GF300 radar system that France has also sent to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The Rafale is a multi-role fourth generation fighter jet, similar in role to the American F-16, capable of carrying out long-range bombing and dogfighting tasks in the same mission, according to the French military.\n \n\n   \n  France has previously provided Kyiv with Mirage jets, which form the backbone of France’s aerial bomber force.\n \n\n   \n  France has seen broad success exporting the Rafale, including to India.\n \n\n   \n  In what has been described as the largest aerial battle of the modern era, India lost one of its Rafale jets in combat with Pakistani forces in May, according to a  French intelligence source . However, the French jets’ performance in the India Air Force has been widely praised by  expert reviews  in the Indian press.\n \n\n   \n  The French aviation firm behind the Rafale, Dassault, is looking to boost its production output to four fighter jets per month and the company said it has 233 jets still on order, as of October 7.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement signed Monday is merely a letter of intent, still a way off a concrete purchase, spurring questions as to how Ukraine will pay for the French jets when Ukraine signed a letter of understanding  for 100-150 Swedish-made Grippen jets in October.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to European Union members on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested that Ukraine had three options – independently or in combination – to meet its financing needs. She said these were grants from EU allies, a loan funded by EU borrowing or loan linked to the cash balance of frozen Russian assets, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The Elysee Palace also said that European financing could be used for the purchases as well as financing from frozen Russian assets.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/saudi-execution-rate-human-rights-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"08:26:00-05:00","title":"Saudi Arabia Executes Hundreds, Including Fishermen Accused of Drug Smuggling, Amid Economic Diplomacy","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohamed Saad, an Egyptian fisherman, vanished in 2017 after a fishing trip off Sharm el-Sheikh and was later detained in Saudi Arabia on drug-smuggling charges.

The Saudis say he smuggled drugs. He was one of hundreds executed this year \n       \n  By Muhammad Darwish, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:26 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For a year, Mohamed Saad’s family had no idea whether he was alive or dead. The 28-year-old Egyptian fisherman had gone out on a routine trip off the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and never returned. Relatives searched for months with no word from authorities. When they finally heard his voice, it was from a prison in Tabuk, northern  Saudi Arabia,  where Saad said he was being held on drug-smuggling charges.\n \n\n   \n  On October 21 the  Saudi state killed him,  eight years after being detained. The family learned of his death through a cellmate. The official Saudi news agency said a court had judged him guilty of  smuggling amphetamine pills . As of now, Saudi officials still have not notified Saad’s family of his killing, nor told them where he is buried, a person close to the family told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Saad was one of hundreds of people executed this year in  Saudi Arabia,  most accused of non-lethal drug crimes, according to a database compiled by the Berlin-based European Saudi Organization for Human Rights (ESOHR) and Reprieve, which monitors Saudi media and speaks to families.\n \n\n   \n  Many were foreigners: Egyptian, Somali or Ethiopian migrant workers drawn by the kingdom’s economic allure and later trapped in its justice system. In 2024 the kingdom executed 345 people, rights groups say, double the rate of the past few years.\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming its de facto leader in 2017, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known by his initials, MBS, has sought to modernize the kingdom at a breath-taking rate. Seasoned visitors describe the country as almost unrecognizable. He has neutralized the religious police, abolished flogging, allowed women to drive, and will host soccer’s 2034 FIFA World Cup. His country has flown in musicians and sports stars from across the globe and launched world-famous festivals.\n \n\n   \n  It’s all in a bid to attract Western tourists and capital as he embarks on an ambitious economic transformation plan, dubbed Vision 2030.\n \n\n   \n  That plan will be high on his agenda when he travels to Washington DC this week, his first visit in seven years. He will be seeking American commitments to the kingdom’s economy and defense, and a high-profile US-Saudi investment summit is set to take place on November 19.\n \n\n   \n  Few expect human rights to feature prominently when the two meet. But campaigners warn that the PR drive is masking a dark reality back home – and the crown prince’s closeness to Trump is giving him free rein.\n \n\n   \n  Despite MBS saying back in 2018 that the kingdom was  working on minimizing executions , Saudi Arabia continues to execute more people than almost any other country on earth, with the exception of Iran and China, observers and rights groups say.\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke with four sources close to the families of people who have either been executed or are on death row, facilitated by the international nonprofit Reprieve, and the ESOHR, to bring their stories to light. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retribution against the families.\n \n\n   \n  Some cases belie the images of a modern nation – in one, a Saudi woman and a Yemeni man were executed after being accused of kidnapping babies to  practice sorcery .\n \n\n   \n  Rights groups have been sounding the alarm. At the current pace of executions, they say, Saudi Arabia is on track to break its record again this year.\n \n\n   \n  Several foreign nationals remain in the same Tabuk prison where Saad was held. Among them is Essam al-Shazly, a 27-year-old Egyptian fisherman on death row for smuggling amphetamines and 1.8g of a substance “thought to be heroin,” according to legal documents seen by CNN. A person close to the family says he wasn’t aware of what was on the boat when boarding.\n \n\n   \n  “The family had been searching for two months for him. It wasn’t until they received a phone call from him in prison they knew what happened,” the person said.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to UN special rapporteurs dated in January,  the Saudi government rejected allegations  of secret executions, unfair trials and the mistreatment of foreign prisoners. It called the claims inaccurate, saying that bodies of those executed are returned to embassies and that official notices are published by the Saudi Press Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia also said all capital cases pass through three levels of judicial review: trial, appeal and Supreme Court, before being approved by royal decree. It denied allegations of discrimination or torture, saying all prisoners are treated equally and that foreign nationals have consular access and that the death penalty is reserved “for the most serious crimes and in extremely limited circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Kingdom’s Ministry of Media for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Human rights groups and sources close to the defendants say prisoners are not always given legal representation and when they are, it rarely changes the outcome of the case.\n \n\n   \n  Accounts from Tabuk prison, relayed to CNN by people close to those incarcerated, describe prisoners on death row waiting each morning to hear if their name will be called, signaling their execution that day.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Saudi Arabia thinks it has carte blanche’\n \n\n   \n  Further east, in Dammam, two young Shiite men are on death row: Hassan Zaki al-Faraj and Jawad and  Abdullah  Qureiris, now in their twenties. Both were arrested and sentenced to death for crimes committed as teenagers during the Arab Spring, rights groups and people close to their families said.\n \n\n   \n  Sources close to al-Faraj’s family say police raided his home in 2017, beat the men inside and detained them. He and his father remain in custody.\n \n\n   \n  The ESOHR says Qureiris was accused of attending a funeral that officials classified as an illegal protest and spent 270 days in solitary confinement upon detention.  CNN previously reported that his younger  brother, Murtaja, was on death row aged 13 on similar charges and  later released .\n \n\n   \n  Critics say the Trump administration has chosen to prioritize trade and weapons sales over human rights. In May, Riyadh and Washington announced a  $142 billion arms deal , part of a wider $600 billion commitment for energy, infrastructure and technology development.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also chose Riyadh for the first foreign visit of his first and second terms as president, which preceded the more than  $2 trillion in wider Gulf investment pledges to the United States .\n \n\n   \n  Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi scholar based in London, told CNN: “Saudi society has been silenced, especially with Trump’s return… Saudi Arabia thinks it has carte blanche.”\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince is “a ruler who believes he can do whatever he wants,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the US-based rights group DAWN. “He enjoys (a) complete lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “(The executions) are meant to instil fear and show that the consequences for behavior deemed unacceptable by the Saudi government are severe and harsh,” Whitson said.\n \n\n   \n  For prisoners like Hassan al-Faraj, Jawad Qureiris, and Essam al-Shazly, and their families, the painful wait continues.  They count the weeks between short phone calls, the months between updates. All dread hearing the worst.\n \n\n   \n  “It is hard to overstate how cruel and how cynical this regime is. It’s a system of lies and brutality,” said Jeed Basyouni, head of Reprieve’s death penalty team for the Middle East and North Africa. “The lies start at the top, with Mohammed bin Salman telling journalists he plans to reduce the use of capital punishment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/business/trump-prices-affordability","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-05:30","title":"Trump is right: He lowered some of your costs.

some of your costs. But he also made many prices higher \n       \n  By David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump keeps  downplaying America’s affordability crisis , and he continues to falsely claim that inflation and overall prices have fallen during his second term.\n \n\n   \n  “Our prices are coming down very substantially on groceries and things,” Trump told reporters in Florida Sunday evening. “They’re already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”\n \n\n   \n  The truth is annual  inflation stood at 3%  in September. Grocery prices have  gained 1.4%  between January and September, and US consumer prices have  risen 1.7%  on average during Trump’s second term, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s just an average. Look a little more closely, and Trump really can claim credit for  some  falling prices. But he is also to blame for some  rising  prices.\n \n\n   \n  A complex mix of factors determines the price of any particular item.   As anyone who took Econ 101 remembers, supply and demand remain the primary influences over consumer prices. But commodity costs, wholesale prices, transportation and fuel concerns, regulations, labor and a whole host of other considerations can weigh on what people ultimately pay at the store.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s policies, perhaps more than any president’s in recent memory, have directly influenced the prices on thousands of consumer goods – both lower and higher.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump has done to lower prices\n \n\n   \n   Drugs:  Pharmaceuticals remain the the most prominent example of Trump directly influencing prices lower. Trump has put significant pressure on drugmakers to lower prices, and many have followed suit.\n \n\n   \n  Most recently, Trump and his administration announced that certain  blockbuster obesity drugs  will be available for as little as $149 per month, significantly lower than the list prices, which can top $1,000. Trump has also announced deals with  Pfizer ,  AstraZeneca  and others to set prices of new medications at  “Most Favored Nation”  levels, the lowest price made available in peer countries.\n \n\n   \n   Eggs:  When Trump took office, egg prices had been surging because a deadly avian flu epidemic devastated the egg-laying hen population. Egg prices peaked above  $8 a dozen in late February  after rising steadily over the previous year.\n \n\n   \n  A couple weeks into Trump’s term, his  USDA announced an initiative  to lower prices by increasing biosecurity on egg-laying farms, providing aid to farmers who lost flocks and temporarily lifting restrictions on egg imports. The plan worked: Egg prices have since fallen to just over $2 a dozen.\n \n\n   \n   Oil:  Trump dismantled many oil drilling regulations that he claimed would expand US oil production – but, so far at least, that hasn’t made any meaningful difference. Trump, however, publicly pressured OPEC+ on prices, and though the group of oil-producing nations denied Trump had anything to do with its decision, OPEC+ boosted production several times this year, and US oil fell below $60 a barrel – down from $75 when Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  Industry experts have  partially attributed  OPEC’s decision to Trump’s influence, although they also say OPEC’s hand may have been forced by nations that acted independently of the group. And oil prices have ebbed and flowed with sinking demand and on-and-off Middle East conflicts throughout the year, as well.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also announced some policies that could have long-term benefits for consumers but whose effects remain to be seen.\n \n\n   \n   Beef and fruit:  Last week, Trump signed executive orders that  lowered tariffs  on imported beef and other produce that mostly grows overseas. That could lower some of those prices, but the tariff cuts largely just  restore import prices to where they were  before Trump launched his sweeping trade war.\n \n\n   \n   Cars:  Trump’s domestic policy and tax bill  did away with a number of financial penalties  on automakers that fail to meet fuel efficiency rules. That is saving some US automakers billions of dollars a year and could cut the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%, according to Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. But that may not translate to lower consumer prices because Trump also raised tariff costs on automakers.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump has done to raise prices\n \n\n   \n   Tariffs:  By far the largest price increase on consumers that Trump has imposed came in the form of his sweeping tariffs on virtually every foreign country’s goods. That has raised the effective US tariff rate to 13.6%, up from 1.2% in 2024 – a gigantic tax increase that has raised the average American household’s costs this year by $1,200, according to the conservative-leaning  Tax Foundation .\n \n\n   \n  The calculation is tricky, because tariffs are paid by US importers who typically pass those costs onto wholesalers, retailers and eventually consumers. JPMorgan this month estimated that consumers are currently paying about 20% of tariffs’ costs, but many businesses have announced they can no longer afford to eat those expenses and will soon be forced to raise consumer prices. That’s why the Tax Foundation estimates the average household’s annual costs will rise by $1,600 because of Trump’s tariffs next year.\n \n\n   \n   Benefits cuts:  Historic  cuts to America’s safety net programs , including Medicaid and food stamps, will raise out-of-pocket expenses for the country’s neediest: Those earning less than $18,000 a year will have to spend more than 1% more going forward because of Trump’s tax and spending policy bill, according to  Penn Wharton \n \n\n   \n  The bill also cut some popular tax credits, including the  $7,500  that the government chipped in when customers bought electric vehicles.\n \n\n   \n   America’s debt:  Trump’s massive tax cut and spending bill will add nearly $4 trillion to America’s $36 trillion in debt, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. That briefly sent the bond market into a tizzy in May, leading US Treasury yields ﻿ , which trade in opposite direction to prices, significantly higher. Investors had effectively sent a warning that they may be unwilling to keep funding the government’s coffers unless they get paid more for it.\n \n\n   \n  Yields have since come down – but not by a ton. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage, credit card and auto loan rates, remains above 4.1%.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s spending and economic policies have also hurt the dollar, which has fallen more than 8% this year. That can boost the appeal of US-made goods abroad, but it also makes foreign goods more expensive for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Trump has effectively tried to will lower prices into existence,  recently calling  America’s affordability crisis a “lie” and a “complete con job.” The White House, while casting blame elsewhere, acknowledged it has some work to do.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in,” the White House said in a statement Friday. “We’re making progress — and the best is yet to come.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/economy/powell-fed-consensus","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Jerome Powell’s era of consensus at the Fed is over","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve is experiencing a significant shift from the long-standing consensus under Chair Jerome Powell to a fractured policy division, with two dissenting votes in late October marking the first such occurrence in over five years.

of consensus at the Fed is over \n       \n  Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal Reserve policymakers are split over whether they should continue cutting interest rates, ending a period of consensus that has defined Chair Jerome Powell’s leadership of the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s  latest decision  to lower interest rates by a quarter point in late October was opposed by two policymakers: one official who preferred to hold rates steady, and another who wanted a larger rate cut instead. A pair of opposing dissents had not been seen since 2019. Earlier this year, more than one Fed governor cast a dissenting vote for the first time in more than three decades.\n \n\n   \n  The growing  divide among Fed officials   has spilled out into public speeches in recent days, presenting a challenge for Powell as he works to retain consensus among colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  That division is a direct result of the uncertainty in the US economy and questions around the impacts of President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policy. The murky economic outlook has divided the rate-setting committee, which is tasked by Congress to keep the labor market intact and to tame inflation. Some Fed officials want to continue to focus on reining in higher prices, believing that tariffs could jack up inflation. Other policymakers say it’s time to prioritize a weakening labor market.\n \n\n   \n  Economists say the potential implications of a divided Fed are a mixed bag, but nonetheless represent an extraordinary shift in the politics of the world’s most powerful central bank.\n \n\n   \n  “If these intellectual disagreements aren’t able to be reconciled, then that could affect the Fed’s effectiveness and credibility,” said Derek Tang, an economist at LHMeyer, a monetary policy analytics firm.\n \n\n   \n  “In the next decade or so, the Fed could become like the Supreme Court, with people voting along party lines,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed chair’s tough job\n \n\n   \n  As leader of America’s central bank — and chair of its influential rate-setting committee — Powell now has his work cut out for him, but the outcome may be beyond his control.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few decades, the Fed chair has increasingly played a key part in shepherding the central bank’s policy decisions through careful consensus-building efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed chair’s role of seeking unanimous agreement notably began under former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, according to Jon Hilsenrath, a long-time Fed watcher and senior adviser at brokerage firm StoneX Group. It involves regular meetings with members of the Fed’s seven-person Board of Governors and the 12 regional Fed bank presidents.\n \n\n   \n  “Powell built on what Bernanke and (former Fed Chair Janet) Yellen did,” Hilsenrath said. “But this kind of breakdown in consensus is beyond Jay Powell or his leadership.”\n \n\n   \n  In a post-meeting news conference after the Fed announced its October decision, Powell said there were  “strongly differing views”  among officials on how to move forward. He had previously characterized the division as merely a “healthy debate.”\n \n\n   \n  Dissents from Fed officials are expected to persist through the final meetings of Powell’s term as chair, which ends in May. That could make it difficult for Wall Street to know what to expect from the Fed: The chances of a December rate cut are currently a coin toss, according to futures.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s policymaking these days has indeed gotten much more complex: During the pandemic-fueled recession in 2020, it was clear the Fed needed to lower borrowing costs aggressively — and keep rates at ultra-low levels — to shore up a battered economy. Similarly in 2022, it was obvious the Fed needed to hike rates aggressively to tamp down the fastest inflation in four decades.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, a more divided Fed could bode well for its credibility.\n \n\n   \n  “The market might also come to a conclusion that they’re not going to make extreme choices or lock themselves in to decisions that could lead the economy and the financial system in the wrong direction,” Hilsenrath said. “If there’s more disagreement, then that kind of moderates the Fed’s behavior.”\n \n\n   \n    To cut or not to cut\n \n\n   \n  Assessing the economy became even harder during the government shutdown, which was the longest in American history and suspended the release of weeks of economic data. At their October meeting, Fed officials were left without key readings on inflation and employment, metrics that are vital for policymakers when considering how to address their dual mandate.\n \n\n   \n  With the government now reopened,  an upcoming deluge of data  could easily tilt the scales in either direction.\n \n\n   \n  On the side of holding rates steady to tame inflation are three of the four regional presidents who vote on policy this year. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who dissented in October and preferred no rate cut, explained in a statement that his decision came about partly because people in his district have voiced “widespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  His colleague Alberto Musalem, president of the St. Louis Fed and also a voter this year, said this week: “We need to proceed and tread with caution, because I think there’s limited room for further easing without monetary policy becoming overly accommodative,” at a Thursday event in Evansville, Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she would be “hesitant to ease policy further,” and that it would “likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the opposing camp includes officials who believe the Fed should continue to lower rates, primarily because they don’t see tariffs as likely having a persistent impact on inflation. They also believe the labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff if rates aren’t lowered quickly enough.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who has taken leave from his role as head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers in order to fill a temporarily vacant seat on the central bank’s Board of Governors, dissented on the Fed’s decision last month to lower rates by a quarter point, instead backing a larger, half-point cut. In his latest remarks, he argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that inflation is bound to slow “substantially” regardless.\n \n\n   \n  Miran is joined by Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, also Trump appointees, who have called for rate cuts starting in July. They believe that with inflation close enough to the Fed’s target rate of 2%, the primary concern should be the softening labor market.\n \n\n   \n  “If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” Miran told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/venezuela-cartel-state-department","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:51:00.000-04:00","title":"US ramps up pressure campaign on Venezuela, set to designate cartel as a foreign terrorist organization","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has designated Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), effective November 24, 2025, alleging it is led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and other high-ranking officials and responsible for drug trafficking and violent acts across the hemisphere.

     \n  By Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:51 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States increased pressure on Venezuela over the weekend, saying it will designate Cartel de los Soles as  a foreign terrorist organization  — a move President Donald Trump suggested could allow the US to target certain assets and infrastructure in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The US alleges the cartel is led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and other high-ranking officials, and the announcement was yet another sign of tensions between the countries as Trump weighs  potential military options .\n \n\n   \n  “Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela’s legitimate government,” the  State Department  said in a press release. “Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  The designation, which will be effective November 24, comes as the United States has  ramped up its military presence  in the Caribbean, including with the arrival of the world’s largest aircraft carrier on Sunday. Tensions have risen between President Donald Trump and Maduro as US forces target alleged drug-trafficking operations, with the US conducting its  21st known strike  against an alleged drug boat over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested Sunday that designating Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization allows the US military the ability to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “It allows us to do that, but we haven’t said we’re going to do that,” Trump told reporters. “We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out.”\n \n\n   \n  “They would like to talk,” he said, without elaborating further.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump signaled on Friday that he had made a decision on military actions regarding Venezuela, he was noncommittal on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also said Sunday he doesn’t believe the administration needs congressional authorization for potential military actions inside Venezuela. Rather, the president said he would like to keep lawmakers informed without a say.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to keep Congress involved. I mean, we’re stopping drug dealers and drugs from coming into our country. … We don’t have to get their approval. But I think letting them know is good,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported  skepticism from some experts  on the legality of the boat strikes, as the United States has not declared war against Venezuela. The terrorist organization designation authorizes a US president to impose sanctions but doesn’t explicitly authorize the use of lethal force.\n \n\n   \n  However, the foreign terrorist organization designation is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism designations. It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US.\n \n\n   \n  Congress has  seven days  to review the foreign terrorist organization designation after being notified, and “in the absence of Congressional action to block the designation,” it then takes effect, according to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Rubio  said  the foreign terrorist organization designation gave the United States the right to “target these groups.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug-dealing organizations. Drug dealing is the kind of terrorism they’re doing, and it’s not the only,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department’s announcement comes after the US Treasury Department sanctioned Cartel de los Soles in July, deeming it a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” organization and alleging it “provided material support to Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the Treasury, “The cartel’s name is derived from the sun insignias often portrayed on the uniforms of Venezuelan military officials.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi put out a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro  to face US drug charges . She has  not presented conclusive evidence  of the Venezuelan leader’s alleged role in international drug trafficking. Caracas has flatly rejected the claims.\n \n\n   \n  “Cartel de los Soles, per se, doesn’t exist. It’s a journalistic expression created to refer to the involvement of Venezuelan authorities in drug trafficking,” Phil Gunson, a researcher with the International Crisis Group based in Caracas, previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But this doesn’t mean there aren’t military personnel or government officials involved in drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  “The cartels are here, the Colombians and the Mexicans, too. There are drug shipments via the Orinoco River and by air through clandestine airstrips, flights from Apure to Central America, and so on. All of this wouldn’t be possible without direct involvement from above,” Gunson said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon, Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood, Katie Bo Lillis, Natasha Bertrand and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/equity-stakes-government-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Uncle Sam is outperforming the S&P 500","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is directly investing in public companies such as Intel, MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals to secure critical supply chains for national security, especially in rare earths and semiconductor production.

Critics, meanwhile, say it’s a heavy-handed use of government influence that is un-American and exposes taxpayers to unnecessary risk.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government’s portfolio is outperforming the S&P 500. Intel shares are up 77% this year. MP Materials shares have soared 276%. Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals shares are up 50% and 204%, respectively. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 14.5% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets seem to be understanding these deals as the federal government signaling it will continue to support these companies,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n \n\n   \n    Which companies is the US investing in?\n \n\n   \n  MP Materials is a rare-earths mining company. The company on July 10 announced the Department of Defense (now the Department of War) would purchase $400 million of the company’s stock, giving it a 15% equity stake and making it the company’s largest shareholder.\n \n\n   \n  Intel, the  beleaguered chipmaker , announced on August 22 that the US government would invest $8.9 billion in the company, resulting in a 9.9% equity stake. On October 1, the Energy Department announced it would take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas, a lithium production company.\n \n\n   \n  Trilogy Metals, a mining company that is developing an  enormous mining project in Alaska , announced on October 6 that the US government would invest in the company. The Department of War took a  10% equity stake  in Trilogy Metals.\n \n\n   \n  The Commerce Department announced on November 3 that it would take a $50 million stake in Vulcan Elements, a private rare earths start-up. The government also has a  “golden share”  in US Steel as part of a national security agreement with Nippon Steel, which acquired the company in June.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the government doing this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s actions are meant to address trade tensions with China, including bolstering supply chains of critical materials like chips and rare-earth minerals.\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths in particular have become a sticking point in the US-China trade war. The minerals are used in everyday items like mobile phones as well as highly sensitive industries like defense, aerospace and the military.\n \n\n   \n  China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare-earth elements mining output, 90% of rare earths refining output and over 90% of rare-earth magnet production, according to ING, a Dutch bank.\n \n\n   \n  ‘Self-sufficiency, allied resilience and national industrial champions are no longer optional,” James Litinsky, chief executive at MP Materials, said on the company’s earnings call on November 6. “They are the front lines of security.”\n \n\n   \n  White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that “the Trump administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to safeguard America’s national and economic security.”\n \n\n   \n  There is precedent for the government to take stakes in companies to bail them out during a crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the government took stakes in companies including General Motors, Chrysler and AIG, then turned a small total profit when it exited those stakes by 2015.\n \n\n   \n  But the government taking stock in companies outside of emergency situations is rare. Experts say it falls within a legal gray area.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a real break from past attitudes toward government ownership, particularly for Republicans,” Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    What are some of the concerns?\n \n\n   \n  Skeptics say this kind of government intervention goes against free market values — and raises the risks of big losses for taxpayers. It’s also uncertain that an equity stake can produce stronger supply chains.\n \n\n   \n  “There is the risk of failure. Not all investments work out,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “You’re going to find people who are questioning, ‘Why are we doing this? We don’t need to risk our tax dollars.’”\n \n\n   \n  Scott Ladner, CIO at Horizon Investments, said he was skeptical about the decision to take stakes in companies. The government historically has been poor at picking winners, he said, and it could divert money away from other, more compelling companies that are not in the government’s purview.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t like the precedent that it sets going forward,” Ladner said. “These individual ones might end up working fine, but the precedent and the power that it gives to the government 10, 15, 20 years from now — I don’t love that precedent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"13:34:00-05:00","title":"A death sentence for my son: Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities plan to deport sick Palestinian patients from East Jerusalem hospitals back to Gaza, despite the fact that Gaza’s healthcare system is severely damaged—94% of its hospitals are destroyed—and patients, including a 16-year-old boy with a rare bleeding disorder and a man with kidney failure, face imminent death due to lack of medical treatment.

\nUpdated: \n        1:34 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Yamen Al-Najjar recalls his past life – the days when he went to school and laughed regularly. Today, the 16-year-old lives with his mother in a cramped 6-square-meter room, just large enough to hold a hospital bed he seldom leaves.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is hard. I am sick and in pain all the time… I feel alone, and I miss home,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen, who has a bleeding disorder, was medically evacuated from Gaza City with his mother to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem just two days before the October 7 attack in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  His condition is rare, according to his mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, and his doctors, who have struggled to manage his symptoms and been unable to get him the treatment he needs, even in East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Najjar has been working to get her son medically evacuated to a third country for the last two years. She managed to get World Health Organization (WHO) approval for a medical transfer but has been looking for 14 months for a host country to accept her son for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, she got news that she said made her heart stop. Doctors at Makassed Hospital told her that Israeli authorities had decided to send all Gazan patients back home the next week, even those who are currently undergoing treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “All my hard work will vanish before my eyes. I can’t comprehend how a sick child is going to be sent back to a disaster-stricken area… This is a death sentence for my son,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The family was informed on Sunday evening that Yamen’s name had been dropped from the list of patients to be deported on Monday morning, and that he would be allowed to stay for treatment for his chronic condition.\n \n\n   \n  But around 100 Gazan patients and their companions were still due for deportation, according to medical teams at Makassed Hospital and Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem and the Sheba-Tal Hasmomer hospital in Israel. They told CNN that while most patients have agreed to return to Gaza, some are being sent against their will as there is no treatment for them in the battered enclave. The WHO said last month that 94% of hospitals there have been  damaged or destroyed .\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of those being deported are babies born to women who were brought to Jerusalem for treatment, while the oldest is 85 years old, hospital authorities said. Most have been in the city since before the war.\n \n\n   \n  Salwa Massad, a research manager at WHO, told CNN that the organization had been asked by the Israeli military’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate the transfer of the patients.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out COGAT but has yet to receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen’s father, brother and two sisters are in Gaza, displaced in a tent camp in Al-Mawasi in the south after their home in Gaza City was bombed. He hasn’t seen them in two years.\n \n\n   \n  His mother said Yamen’s condition is so poor, he wouldn’t be able to survive in a tent even for a few hours without medical treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “His blood pressure fluctuates, his temperature is always low, he bleeds all the time, and he suffers from body aches… I categorically refuse to return to Gaza,” she said, tearful.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli non-profit Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) called the attempt to return patients to Gaza “unacceptable from moral, medical, and legal standpoints,”, pointing to Gaza’s “nonfunctional” healthcare system.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure that patients in need of medical care continue to receive it in the hospitals where they are currently admitted, or in any other hospital in Israel or abroad,” Aseel Aburass, director of the Occupied Territories Department at PHRI told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Aburass stressed the importance of this obligation, saying it was Israel itself that destroyed Gaza’s health care system and so “cannot now shirk its responsibility for the lives and health of these patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel’s parliament echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Yamen’s welfare is Israel’s responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending them back under the current conditions will be a death blow; instead of dying from an airstrike, he will die from being deprived of medical treatment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I will die there in two days’\n \n\n   \n  Nafez Al Qahwaji, from Khan Younis in Gaza, told CNN that he has kidney failure and needs dialysis three times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “The hospital informed us yesterday that we will all be deported back to Gaza, I was shocked to hear this after knowing the inhuman conditions that patients live in in Gaza,” he said at Makassed Hospital. “Why do they want to throw me to hell, I will die there in two days.” On Sunday evening, he was told his name was dropped from the deportation list and that he could remain at the hospital for his treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Nael Ezzeddine, from Jabalya, has not objected to returning. He has a heart condition and has been at Makassed Hospital for 25 months. He said his home in Gaza was struck by the Israeli military and that he lost everything, but his loved ones are waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my family. I have 10 children and my wife – they are all displaced in a tent in Deir el-Balah. I want to go and be with them. I know how they suffer, but what will I do here?” he said. “They want to force us to leave, and they are threatening to send us back all the time… I’m tired of this. I just want to go to my family, even if I end up dying.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that sick patients from Gaza have faced this threat.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, Israeli authorities were preparing to send back 22 Palestinians from East Jerusalem to Gaza, including newborns and cancer patients. Israel’s Supreme Court then temporarily halted those plans following a petition by PHRI and a  CNN report  on the hospital patients.\n \n\n   \n  Most of Yamen’s paintings are colorful illustrations of nature, landscapes and Palestinian culture. He said his passion for art comes from his desire to “bring color back to a world that has turned gray.”\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my house, my siblings’ voices, my school, colors and the sea. I miss my toys that I gathered throughout my childhood, and every moment when Gaza was safe,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have suffered a lot and I just want to rest… I hope every child in Gaza lives like any child in the world… I don’t want any child to get sick or be afraid like me.”\n \n\n   \n   Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that most of the patients have agreed to return to Gaza. \n \n\n   \n   This story has also been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/charlotte-north-carolina-immigration-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Charlotte Becomes Latest Target in DHS Immigration Blitz, Sparking Political and Community Outcry","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Charlotte, North Carolina, became the latest city targeted by a Department of Homeland Security immigration enforcement operation known as 'Charlotte’s Web,' resulting in 81 arrests by Border Patrol agents.

Locals say it’s political \n       \n  By Zoe Sottile, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With dozens of people arrested in North Carolina’s largest city during the Department of Homeland Security’s  latest targeted immigration blitz , one question has emerged for many of its residents and leaders: Why Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  The city hadn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like  Chicago  and  Los Angeles . It’s a Democrat-led city, but it’s hundreds of miles away from either the northern or southern border. And crime has dropped 8% from last year, with violent crimes down 20%,  according to data  released by the city in October.\n \n\n   \n  Before it even started, the announcement that an immigration enforcement operation would arrive in Charlotte – right off the heels of a weekslong operation that led to  hundreds of arrests  and  fierce protests  in Chicago – provoked fear and anxiety in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders in Charlotte have largely framed the operation – which came as a surprise to local officials – as a political distraction ahead of next year’s  midterm elections .\n \n\n   \n  “This administration ran on rhetoric that is anti-immigrant to score political points,” said City Council member Dimple Ajmera, a Democrat. “We have a very important US Senate race in 2026 coming up. And they want to score political points and use fear to divide our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are hoping to flip one of North Carolina’s Senate seats after Republican incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis  pulled out of the race  following criticism from the president who threatened to back a primary challenger to Tillis’ seat. Former North Carolina Gov.  Roy Cooper , who is widely popular across the state,  launched  his campaign in July.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, state Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat, characterized the operation as a Republican political stunt. “The truth is, this move from the federal government, and the silence from GOP state leaders enabling it, are part of the same political distraction,” he said in a statement to CNN. “They’re trying to shift attention away from their own failures, because they have no plan to lower costs, make housing affordable, or expand real opportunity for working people.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement the surge would “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency claimed “nearly 1,400 detainers across North Carolina have not been honored – releasing criminal illegal aliens into North Carolina’s neighborhoods.” Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” but it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration into the city has increased in recent years. Around 18.2% of the city’s population was foreign-born in 2023, according to  US Census data , around double that of North Carolina at large. And there have been disagreements in the city in the past about immigration enforcement. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ended the county’s decadelong  287(g) partnership  with ICE in 2018, to the chagrin of Republican officials.\n \n\n   \n  The city became a lightning rod for debates about policing and public safety in Democrat-led cities in September, after  a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee  was stabbed to death on Charlotte public transit by a man with a lengthy history of arrests and mental health problems.\n \n\n   \n  Though the suspect arrested in that case is a US citizen, President Donald Trump seized on the killing as an example of what he framed as out-of-control crime, and he pledged to send the National Guard to blue cities across the country. Three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation, who represent districts around Charlotte,  asked the governor  earlier this month to deploy the Guard to fight crime.\n \n\n   \n  Top Border Patrol official  Gregory Bovino , who is from North Carolina, has his own answer. In  an Instagram post  with a photo of a man he claimed was an “illegal alien with a violent criminal history,” he wrote, “This is why border security matters. This is why we’re in Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n    Weekend of turmoil\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents arrested 81 people in Charlotte on Saturday, Bovino  said Sunday , in an operation DHS dubbed “Charlotte’s Web.” He didn’t specify the reasons for the arrests or the names of those arrested but said many had “significant criminal and immigration history.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino – who was criticized by a federal judge over  his and his agents’ use of force  in Chicago – was spotted on video during the detainment of a person outside a grocery store in Pineville, around 10 miles south of Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  A man with  a REAL ID  who says he became a US citizen in 2019 was caught in the fray. Federal agents smashed the car window of Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, a Honduran immigrant who lives in Charlotte, and then detained him before letting him go a little while later. Medina said he pleaded with federal agents to look at his ID after the arrest.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, a Customs and Border Patrol agent said that officers had “approached an individual who acted increasingly erratic. The individual escalated the situation and refused to comply to lawful commands by officers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson, in a Saturday interview with CNN, said there’s “fear and anxiety rampant” across the city.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a legal advocacy nonprofit, said it had seen federal agents in “camouflage and tactical gear operating out of unmarked vehicles” – a sight that has  become characteristic  of DHS’ operations across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “We have also witnessed an escalation in hostile actions, including the arrest of U.S. citizens, physical assaults on community members, and the disruption of places of worship, businesses, and restaurants where people have been questioned about their immigration status,” said the group in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to questions about the nonprofit’s claims but sent CNN a statement including the photos and names of people it said were immigrants with criminal histories released in North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters decrying the operation filled a Charlotte park Saturday, then marched through the streets of uptown.\n \n\n   \n    Businesses close as Border Patrol agents arrive\n \n\n   \n  Several businesses closed temporarily in the wake of the announced operation, among them a popular Colombian bakery that had closed its doors only once in the past 28 years.\n \n\n   \n  Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed his family bakery Saturday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the shop, he told CNN. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  The officers emerged from unmarked SUVs Saturday morning, “jumping and taking people down in the street, just people that look like me,” Betancur said. He is a naturalized US citizen and said he’s started carrying his passport with him everywhere he goes, “because I don’t want to go through the trouble. I promised my wife and my kids I’m going to be back home tonight.”\n \n\n   \n  Betancur said he doesn’t want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents – not when they’re just trying to buy cakes or pastries.\n \n\n   \n  A company that manages several bars and restaurants in Charlotte said it closed its properties Saturday night after DHS’s announcement. Dubai Nightlife Charlotte cited the “safety, peace of mind and protection of those who visit us” in making the “preventative” decision, according to a Facebook post in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  The Colombian American Chamber of Commerce of the Carolinas also  announced  it was postponing an event scheduled for Saturday “due to recent action to bolster immigration operations in several cities across the country.”\n \n\n   \n    Deployment surprised local officials\n \n\n   \n  The announcement that Charlotte would be the next city targeted by federal immigration officials  was unexpected  – including for local government.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of the plan.\n \n\n   \n  City Council member Malcolm Graham, who said he was unaware of the planned operation before CNN called him, said, “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans. McFadden said Thursday afternoon two federal officials contacted him about the arrival of Border Patrol agents but said details on the federal operation had not been shared with the sheriff’s office and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  Even the operation’s name has attracted controversy: Martha White, the granddaughter of “Charlotte’s Web” author E.B. White and his literary executor, decried it as an attempt to ride the beloved children book’s “coattails without permission” in a statement to CNN. Her grandfather, she said, “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein noted  in a statement on social media  that Border Patrol has detained many people without criminal histories in Chicago. He urged residents to use their phones to record “if you see something bad happening.”\n \n\n   \n  “Local law enforcement will be here protecting the people of this state long after these federal agents go on to the next place,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, suggested Charlotte’s growing immigrant population as a possible reason the city is being targeted. The city is home to Charlotte Immigration Court and a large ICE field office, she said. The move could also be seen as “retaliation” for the sheriff’s decision to end collaboration with ICE, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a level of, ‘let’s add another city to a roster, create some havoc, and move on’ as well,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans welcome surge\n \n\n   \n  Some of the state and city’s Republicans, meanwhile, have welcomed the surge.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re grateful to see these brave men and women in federal law enforcement following through on President Trump’s promise to remove violent criminal illegals from our country and those stoking fear about these targeted operations must stop at once,” NCGOP Communications Director Matt Mercer said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Kyle Kirby, the chair of Mecklenburg County’s GOP, told CNN he believed Charlotte was targeted because of its large immigration court and the sheriff’s refusal to work with ICE. “When local leaders release individuals flagged for federal pickup back into the community, it simply forces federal agencies to step in,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At least one Republican had more mixed feelings. Ed Driggs, who, after Democrats flipped a seat in this month’s election, will be the lone Republican on Charlotte’s City Council next year, said early in the week he was surprised to learn it was Border Patrol being sent to Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m conflicted. I have a hard line on identifying and deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes, but I’m not sure this is the way to do it,” said Driggs. “That’s the right thing to do, deport violent criminals. But they are running over local government and it’s causing concern from legal people, legal Americans and legal immigrants.”\n \n\n   \n  Driggs said if there were more local coordination ahead of time – instead of finding out through “anonymous media sources” – the Border Patrol operation may not have been met with such initial fear and confusion from the city’s residents.\n \n\n   \n  “The involvement of people who are elected locally gives residents, legal residents, comfort. Otherwise this could feel like an invasion.”\n \n\n   \n    New Orleans is next, sources say\n \n\n   \n  Bovino’s crackdown on immigration is expected to continue apace in other Democrat-led cities after Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  The next stop: New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  The president has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans, a Democrat-led city in a Republican-led state,  as far back as September . He said the city has a “crime problem.” But the National Guard plan hasn’t materialized, as efforts to deploy the National Guard in  Chicago  and  Portland  have largely been stymied by the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Neither have the president’s ideas to send troops to  Baltimore  and  New York .\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to Fox News on Thursday from West Virginia – before the Charlotte operation was officially announced – Bovino floated a few cities that Border Patrol could head to next.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re going to see us redeploy to – it could be New York, it could be Chicago, it could be Charlotte.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-epstein-analysis","dateOfPublication":"1227-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:37:00-05:00","title":"What Marjorie Taylor Greene’s political revolt may say about Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent Republican Congresswoman known for her aggressive MAGA rhetoric, has publicly apologized for her role in toxic political discourse, marking a rare and significant break from her past.

Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:37 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Marjorie Taylor Greene did something politicians almost never do: She said she was sorry.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia representative on Sunday  repudiated her role  in inflaming the country’s poisoned politics in her latest  sharp break  with President Donald Trump and his provocative rhetoric, furthering her own intriguing political reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics; it’s very bad for our country,” Greene told CNN’s Dana Bash in a frank interview on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been working on this a lot lately — to put down the knives in politics. I really just want to see people be kind to one another. And we need to figure out a new path forward that is focused on the American people, because, as Americans, no matter what side of the aisle we’re on, we have far more in common than we have differences,” Greene said.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, one of the highest-profile MAGA voices, explained that she’d been reflecting on her past political antics following the horrific assassination of conservative icon Charlie Kirk in September. And she fears her own safety is now in question. She wrote on X later on Sunday that “unwarranted and vicious attacks against” her by Trump “were a dog whistle to dangerous radicals” and that she was receiving multiple threats.\n \n\n   \n  Trump dismissed her concerns, telling reporters Sunday, “I don’t think her life is in danger. … Frankly, I don’t think anybody cares about her,” and referring to the Georgia lawmaker as “Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Greene.”\n \n\n   \n  The breakup between Trump and Greene, one of his most enthusiastic supporters in the 2024 election, was worsened by her decision to sign on to a push in the House to release investigative files about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has furiously resisted the move. But on Sunday evening, he reversed his position, saying Republicans should call for the files’ release in a House vote this week. He  wrote on Truth Social , “we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s remarks earlier Sunday were notable for many reasons. First, the sight of a politician answering a question directly and expressing contrition was unusual. Bash asked Greene, who once heckled President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address, why she criticized toxic politics only when it was directed at her. “I think that’s fair criticism,”  Greene replied .\n \n\n   \n  Her reversal was also significant because she was once one of the most enthusiastic proponents of the stunts and stinging rhetoric that are central to MAGA politics and to Trump’s public statements. When she came to Washington after she was first elected in 2020, Greene was known for  promoting conspiracy theories , including over school shootings and the beliefs of the far-right QAnon movement.\n \n\n   \n  She later got into heated verbal confrontations with colleagues and even suggested a “national divorce” between red and blue states because of Democrats’ “traitorous America Last policies.” Critics have also warned that some of her rhetoric was  antisemitic .\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s comments Sunday were striking, too, because they deepened her split with Trump, in a rare example of a Republican lawmaker willing to publicly criticize the president, who has kept an iron grip on his party for nearly a decade and caused Republicans on Capitol Hill to abdicate their constitutional oversight role.\n \n\n   \n    Greene’s critiques extend beyond Epstein\n \n\n   \n  But Greene has not just criticized Trump over Epstein. In recent weeks, she’s raised alarms about the cost of living and slammed her party for not doing more to alleviate the rising cost of  health insurance , after she said premiums for her adult children were set to double.\n \n\n   \n  And in another dramatic break with the president, she has even argued that he’s not being faithful to the “America First” principles of the political movement that he created, criticizing his foreign tours and meetings with foreign leaders like Syria’s president, who visited last week. “I would love to see Air Force One be parked and stay home and there be nothing but a constant focus in the White House on a domestic agenda that helps the American people once and for all,” Greene said on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s evolution has revealed her as a politician who is more subtle than she first appeared, and who is increasingly adept at wielding her own power. And it has played into a deepening sense that Trump, surrounded by obsequious officials and billionaires, and who seems obsessed with physical manifestations of his legacy — including  a new White House ballroom  — is out of touch with American public opinion and even the voters who sent him back to the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s calls for the release of the Epstein files fanned Trump’s public rage and sharpened questions about why he had been so unwilling to allow the release of material that sex trafficking victims want made public. Trump was once a friend of Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019, but there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of the president.\n \n\n   \n  All of this has raised questions in Washington about whether there are ulterior motives behind Greene’s conversion. After all, it is rare for a leading political figure to confound their own caricature and to disown their own past behavior. Trump, for instance, has lived by a mantra of never apologizing for anything and never leaving an attack unanswered.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s explanation that she reconsidered her own behavior after the Kirk assassination sounds genuine and could serve as an example at a time of fraught national tensions. The killing of the Turning Point USA activist was a traumatic experience for the MAGA movement and for all Americans, and came a year after two assassination attempts against Trump. It ought to lead to political reflection.\n \n\n   \n    Greene denies her political change was motivated by thwarted ambition\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s warnings about the cost of living also ring true and suggest she is living in the real world rather than the rarified community of wealth that the president inhabits.\n \n\n   \n  But might she also be making a shrewd political move at a time when Trump is becoming increasingly unpopular? Her strategy is not without political risk, with the president saying he’d support a primary challenge against her. But Greene presumably has a strong read on opinions within the 14th Congressional District in northwest Georgia that she represents. She also, thanks to her visibility, has an independent power base.\n \n\n   \n  Her willingness to separate herself from Trump is a threat to the cohesion of the GOP in the House and an indicator of the party’s fragile majority, which numbers just a few votes.\n \n\n   \n  Such a slim margin gives individual lawmakers great power — as has been shown by Greene’s signing on to a discharge position with three other GOP members to force a vote on the Epstein files led by dissident conservative  Rep. Thomas Massie  of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and other Greene critics have argued that thwarted ambition is behind her criticism of him. The president said in a Truth Social post in which he withdrew his support for “‘Wacky’ Marjorie” that he had told her not to run for governor of Georgia or for a Senate seat.\n \n\n   \n  One of Greene’s Democratic adversaries, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has made similar claims about the Senate. But Greene said Sunday she didn’t want to serve anywhere but the House. “I don’t want to have anything to do with the Senate,” Greene said. She cited the chamber’s role in the government shutdown and said she’d also decided she didn’t want to run for governor. But if Greene changes her position on seeking a statewide office in future, or even launches a presidential run, a more moderate political profile might help her win over a wider swath of voters.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Greene’s critics might argue that while she has changed her public persona — by seeking out audiences outside conservative media, for instance, on ABC’s “The View” — her politics remain hardline and her MAGA views are undiluted. She said on CNN on Sunday that she still supports Trump, his administration and his campaign promises. Greene’s views are shared by millions of Americans. But perhaps a more civil dialogue is possible between MAGA conservatives and progressives after years of a national estrangement that only seems to be getting more extreme.\n \n\n   \n  Cynics will watch to see whether Greene’s less volcanic brand of dialogue lasts in Washington’s bitter cauldron. Others might suspect her fracture with Trump will be temporary. The president has had plenty of feuds with people who later reemerge in his orbit. And Greene wore a red MAGA hat with the slogan “Trump was Right About Everything” to his speech to a joint session of Congress earlier this year. “I certainly hope that we can make up,” she told Bash.\n \n\n   \n  But if the fracture is permanent, it will point to an emerging political theme. Greene’s most radical criticism of the president is that he’s no longer embodying “America First” values. This implicitly suggests the movement is distinct from the president himself, something he disagrees with.\n \n\n   \n  “Considering that I’m the one that developed ‘America First,’ and considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides that,” Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump doesn’t take kindly to criticism and views any perceived disloyalty as treachery. These traits have become even more pronounced in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  But Greene’s rupture with him is just the latest hint that members of his party are beginning to assess his behavior and how it might weigh on their fortunes when he no longer controls the GOP. Massie has been arguing to Republicans that they will have to account for votes not to release the Epstein files in future campaign debates. “I would remind my colleagues that this vote is going to be on your record for longer than Trump is going to be president,” he told CNN last week.\n \n\n   \n  And Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy pointed out in a conversation with CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Thursday that while he didn’t consider Trump a lame duck, “In this instance, I think the Constitution is pretty clear that a president, whomever it might be, can only serve two terms.” His comment followed speculation from Trump supporters that the president would try to run again.\n \n\n   \n  The shift in perspective about Trump is still barely perceptible. He’s only in the first year of his second term, and most Republicans still don’t dare to defy him. But amid some of the worst approval ratings of his presidency, there are growing signs some Republicans are beginning to contemplate how to prepare for a political future without him.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/arctic-frost-provision-funding-bill","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Controversial 'Arctic Frost' Provision Divides GOP Lawmakers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A controversial provision included in a stopgap government funding bill requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify senators when their personal information is subpoenaed or they are under criminal investigation.

lawmakers \n       \n  By Morgan Rimmer, Ted  Barrett, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The bill that ended the government shutdown included a provision requiring the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers can also sue the DOJ under the provision, and can be awarded $500,000 or more in damages for each violation by the government if their cases are successful.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called “Arctic Frost,” which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Donald Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register Electoral College votes for Trump from states that former President Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  The provision sparked bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill as critics called it a self-serving measure that would enrich senators at taxpayers’ expense.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans ultimately voted for the funding bill to bring an end to the historic 43-day shutdown. Now, they say they’ll introduce a standalone bill to repeal it.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the controversy on Capitol Hill:\n \n\n   \n    What’s in this provision?\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans accuse former special counsel Jack Smith and FBI leaders of having political motives for obtaining phone records of nine GOP lawmakers with grand jury subpoenas.\n \n\n   \n  The records contain data from four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The records do not include the content of calls. Smith has said the subpoenas were part of routine investigations.\n \n\n   \n  The language that Trump  signed into law  as part of the stopgap funding bill explicitly lays out the various situations and parameters by which federal investigators are required to notify Congress, including when personal electronic records of senators are subpoenaed, when a senator is a target in a criminal investigation, and when data from a Senate office is needed.\n \n\n   \n  It also says that any senator who is not notified about their data being used in an investigation or that they are the target of an investigation may file a lawsuit saying that investigators did not comply with federal law.\n \n\n   \n  “Any Senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any Federal department or agency,” the legislation says.\n \n\n   \n  The law applies retroactively to 2022.\n \n\n   \n    What are House Republicans saying about it?\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that he had been blindsided by the measure added to the bill by Senate Republicans and that the House GOP would draft a separate bill to strike the language, which would come to the floor at a future date.\n \n\n   \n  The issue first drew attention at a House Rules Committee meeting, when the panel was weighing the funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole said he was “surprised” to see the provision. Meanwhile, the top Democrat on the committee, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, slammed it, saying it would provide millions of dollars to the senators investigated in a probe around the fake elector scheme from the 2020 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Reps. Austin Scott, Chip Roy and Morgan Griffith said during the meeting that they are concerned with a provision. “I’ve been asking questions on this since last night, and I’ll tell you, I don’t think that Senate leadership shared with the leadership of the House what they were doing,” Scott said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Scott later told CNN: “I think it’s poorly worded, but I’m glad that other people were paying attention and read the legislation and was able to explain to the American citizens what’s in it.”\n \n\n   \n  A number of House Republicans already support stripping the language.\n \n\n   \n  “That was stupid, quite honestly, to put that language in this bill,” GOP Rep. Troy Nehls said.\n \n\n   \n    How are the ‘Arctic Frost’ senators reacting?\n \n\n   \n  Some of the Republican senators whose phone records were seized as part of Arctic Frost say they won’t seek monetary damages, amid fierce backlash to the provision that allows them to sue.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Sen. Dan Sullivan, one of the senators whose phone records were seized in Smith’s probe, told CNN on Friday “he does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House bill to repeal the provision.” The aide noted the senator first learned of it while reviewing the funding deal.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Bill Hagerty said in an X  post  on Thursday that he was “for accountability for Jack Smith and everyone complicit in this abuse of power,” then added, “I do not want and I am not seeking damages for myself paid for with taxpayer dollars.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Josh Hawley also called for accountability but referred to the measure as “a bad idea.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think the Senate provision is a bad idea. There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ’s outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s office told  WBIR  this week she intended to sue. In a statement to CNN on Friday, her office said, “Senator Blackburn’s plan has always been to seek a declaratory judgment—not monetary damages—to prevent leftists from violating the constitutional rights of conservatives.”\n \n\n   \n  Blackburn, who is running for Tennessee governor in 2026, is also facing pressure from GOP Rep. John Rose, who is making a bid as well. He decried the provision this week as a “poison pill.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Johnson told CNN in a statement he has “no plans at this time” to sue, adding, “If I did sue, it would only be for the purpose of using the courts to expose the corrupt weaponization of federal law enforcement by the Biden and Obama administrations. With the full cooperation in our congressional investigations from the Trump DOJ and FBI, that shouldn’t be necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  He has previously said that he supports the provision “as a deterrent to prevent future misuse of federal agencies.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tommy Tuberville said in an X  post  on Thursday he would sue if a federal judge involved in the probe didn’t face impeachment and Smith wasn’t disbarred and jailed. He wrote, “If they aren’t, I will sue the living hell out of every Biden official involved in this to make sure this NEVER happens to a conservative again.”\n \n\n   \n  He did not say what kind of relief he would seek.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone is forswearing monetary compensation.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lindsey Graham embraced the provision while speaking with reporters in South Carolina  on Wednesday, telling them he is “very much for the idea that if you’ve been wronged there should be a remedy.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he would file a lawsuit, he responded, “Oh, definitely. And if you think I’m going to settle this thing for a million dollars? No. I want to make it so painful, no one ever does this again.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to his office on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reached out to the office of Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Where does the Senate stand?\n \n\n   \n  Following a backlash from House Republicans about the inclusion in the government spending of a provision that would allow senators to sue the Department of Justice if their phone records are obtained without their knowledge, a GOP Senate source familiar defended the legislation as appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  The person, granted anonymity to talk freely about the thinking behind the provision, pointed to a carveout if a senator is under criminal investigation and other rationale for the move. The source declined to comment on the political fallout and what the Senate might do with legislation House Republicans plan to move to undo the policy.\n \n\n   \n  They detailed:\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  Eyes are on the House, which is expected to bring a bill that would nullify the provision.\n \n\n   \n  If that bill passes the House, it remains to be seen if and when Senate GOP Leader John Thune would bring it to the floor for a vote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/americas/chile-election-presidential-runoff-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:45:00.000Z","title":"Chile’s presidential race headed to tense runoff between communist and hard-right candidates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chile’s presidential race has advanced to a tense runoff between Jeannette Jara, a communist former labor minister representing progressive and social safety-oriented policies, and José Antonio Kast, a hard-right candidate advocating for border walls, mass deportations of undocumented migrants, and drastic government spending cuts.

\nUpdated: \n        12:45 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Chile is headed to a tense presidential runoff after a  closely fought first-round  vote Sunday set up a showdown between a member of the Communist Party and an ultraconservative veteran politician, sharply polarizing the country between the political left and right.\n \n\n   \n  Jeannette Jara, 51, the communist former labor minister and candidate of Chile’s center-left governing coalition, claimed 26.7% of valid ballots with over 90% of the vote counted, failing to pass the 50% threshold to secure victory in the first round.\n \n\n   \n  José Antonio Kast, 59, a hard-right former lawmaker and devout Catholic opposed to same-sex marriage and abortion, captured more than 24.1% of the vote, underscoring the resilience of his law-and-order platform as a surge in organized crime rattles one of Latin America’s safest nations and foments anti-migrant sentiment among Chileans.\n \n\n   \n  After learning he would advance to the next round, Kast urged the fractured right-wing to unite behind him, framing the runoff as an existential struggle for Chile’s future.\n \n\n   \n  “It will be the most important election of our generation, a true referendum between two models of society — the current one that has led Chile to destruction, stagnation, violence,” he told fans, interrupted by cheers every few seconds. “And our model, which promotes freedom, hope and progress.”\n \n\n   \n  Jara had a very different message. “This is a great country,” she told supporters in downtown Santiago, the capital. “Don’t let fear freeze your hearts.”\n \n\n   \n    Crime, immigration boost the right\n \n\n   \n  An admirer of US President Donald Trump and Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro, Kast has vowed to deport tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and construct hundreds of kilometers of ditches and walls along Chile’s northern border with Bolivia to prevent people from crossing, particularly from crisis-stricken Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “We want change, and that change today is about security,” José Hernández, the 60-year-old owner of an agricultural company said after casting his ballot for Kast.\n \n\n   \n  Although voters gave Jara a slight edge on Sunday, Kast will benefit in the second round from a large share of votes that went to three eliminated right-wing challengers who campaigned aggressively on the need to tackle illegal immigration.\n \n\n   \n  The third- and fourth-placed candidates were Franco Parisi, a right-leaning populist economist with a large social media following, and Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian and former YouTube provocateur elected as lawmaker in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Chile’s constitution does not allow reelection to consecutive terms, so left-wing  President Gabriel Boric,  whose presidency ends in March, is not standing.\n \n\n   \n  Like her opponents, Jara has called insecurity a top priority, promoting plans to deport foreigners convicted of drug trafficking, boost security along Chile’s borders and tackle money laundering.\n \n\n   \n  “On the question of more jails, more punishments, more imprisonment, closing borders, restricting migrants, there is no debate anymore between the right and left,” said Lucía Dammert, a political scientist and Boric’s first chief of staff.\n \n\n   \n   “But it’s an issue that always enhances the right, everywhere in Latin America.”\n \n\n   \n    Winning over wary voters\n \n\n   \n  The race now goes to a second round on December 14. Analysts believe the starkly opposed Jara and Kast will tack to the middle ground in order to broaden their appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “We will definitely see Jara and Kast after today being even more moderate, talking about things that voters care about and trying to compete for the center,” said Rodolfo Disi, a political scientist at Chile’s Adolfo Ibáñez University.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next month, Jara faces the challenge of winning over voters concerned about her lifelong membership in Chile’s Communist party, which supports authoritarian governments in Cuba and Venezuela. Jara came under fire early on in her campaign for referring to Cuba as a democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “We liked her at first, but that moment was when our opinion shifted, it seemed like a really closed-minded view,” Camila Roure, 29, said outside a polling station. But as a woman, Roure said, she wouldn’t vote for Kast — given his history of opposition to divorce and abortion, even in cases of rape.\n \n\n   \n  Although Kast has more recently sought to deflect attention from what he calls traditional family values and his  German-born father’s  Nazi past – which mobilized progressive voters against him during his last two failed presidential bids – he has made clear his views remain the same.\n \n\n   \n  “A Kast government wouldn’t just be a political shift, it would be a huge step backward,” said Macarena Breke, 27, an English teacher voting for Jara.\n \n\n   \n    Jara promises a social safety net\n \n\n   \n  President Boric, the young, tattooed ex-student protest leader who came to power in 2021 vowing to “bury neoliberalism” on the  heels of mass unrest over inequality , has faced criticism from allies and rivals alike that his government failed to fulfill its sweeping promises of social change.\n \n\n   \n  Economic discontent is simmering in one of Latin America’s most prosperous nations, with growth sluggish and unemployment up over 8.5%. The country retains its dictatorship-era constitution after voters rejected a government-backed charter that would have transformed Chile into one of the world’s most progressive societies.\n \n\n   \n  But Boric’s government has several landmark welfare measures to show for itself — many of them thanks to Jara.\n \n\n   \n  As labor minister, she raised the minimum wage, boosted pensions and shortened the workweek to 40 from 45 hours.\n \n\n   \n  “The right is trying to sell this idea that the country is collapsing.

HudspethBlackburn, Aileen Graef, Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:56 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Sunday night encouraged House Republicans to vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files and move on from what he calls a “Democrat Hoax,” marking a  stark reversal  from his efforts to discredit the effort.\n \n\n   \n  “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown,’” Trump posted on  Truth Social .\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s reversal comes as expectations of mass GOP defections grew ahead of a House vote this week on an attempt to force the Justice Department to release all of the Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n   GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California last week  gathered enough signatures  on a discharge petition to force such a vote.\n \n\n   \n  Massie and Khanna appeared optimistic earlier Sunday about their bill’s chances of passing, insisting there was growing support among the GOP in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Massie said he thought 100 or more Republicans in the House could break with Trump, who last week  appealed  to a handful of Republicans who signed on to the Kentucky lawmaker’s discharge petition effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we could have a deluge of Republicans. There could be 100 or more. I’m hoping to get a veto-proof majority on this legislation when it comes up for a vote,” Massie said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  reported  last week that GOP leaders were bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from Trump and support the bill.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation, which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate. On Sunday, Johnson appeared to preview Trump’s message to House Republicans, telling “Fox News Sunday,” “We’ll just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote, which is expected on Tuesday, came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the oversight panel last week.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said late last week that he would  ask the Justice Department  to investigate Epstein’s ties to a slew of high-profile figures linked to the Democratic Party, representing the president’s most significant effort to discredit the push to release all of the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday she would launch the investigation, assigning the US attorney in New York’s Southern District, to lead it. The move raised fears among critics that the president was seeking to use the Justice Department to politicize any investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Massie said earlier Sunday he thought Trump was “trying to protect a bunch of rich and powerful friends, billionaires, donors to his campaign, friends in his social circles” and told his fellow GOP lawmakers that the “record of this vote will last longer” than Trump’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, who said he’s hoping around 40 Republican lawmakers will vote to release all the Epstein files this week, insisted earlier Sunday that Trump had been “sowing the seeds for his own lame-duck presidency” by going after Republicans who support the release of the files, such as Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s out of touch with his own base,” Khanna said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” before Trump urged Republicans to vote for the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, once a staunch Trump ally, has fallen  out of favor with the president  over her support for the release of files. Trump said Friday that he would no longer support and endorse Greene, who is running for reelection in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, for her part, lamented the fracture, insisting on Sunday that the rift “has all come down to the Epstein files.” She told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that she didn’t understand why the president was fighting the files’ release, as she doesn’t believe he has been implicated in anything illegal.\n \n\n   \n  “That is the question everyone is asking, is, ‘Why fight this so hard?’” Greene said.\n \n\n   \n  While the House bill to release the files is expected to pass, it awaits an uncertain fate in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Sunday whether he thinks the Senate would take up the effort, Massie said he hopes Thune will “do the right thing,” insisting that “pressure is going to be there if we get a big vote in the House.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Annie Grayer and Manu Raju contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/us-gaza-israel-un-vote-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"A US plan for Gaza with big ambition and scant detail faces crucial UN vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A US-backed plan to establish a Board of Peace (BoP) in Gaza for a two-year transitional period, supported by an international force, is facing a crucial vote in the UN Security Council.

to take  Gaza  beyond the fragile truce that took effect last month to a more sustainable peace and reconstruction.\n \n\n   \n  Its central features are a Board of Peace to run  Gaza  for a two-year period, supported by international forces and Palestinian police trained by Egypt. The Board would oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other factions – a key Israeli demand - and the reconstruction of Gaza, according to a draft of the resolution seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution builds on US President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan unveiled in September but is already running into opposition from some in the Israeli government and may face a veto by either Russia or China – or both - when it comes to the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has put forward an alternative plan. And a veto from one of the permanent members of the Security Council would leave the plan in limbo, if not virtually dead in the water.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution is also vague on sequencing and detail.  Western diplomatic sources told CNN that the lack of detail in the resolution will make it hard to put into effect and are pessimistic that even if it passes, the current ceasefire will hold.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of its essential proposals, according to the draft.\n \n\n   \n    Governance in Gaza\n \n\n   \n  The resolution calls for “the establishment of the Board of Peace (BoP) as a transitional administration with international legal personality.”\n \n\n   \n  This is Trump’s idea for interim governance in Gaza. The resolution says it will coordinate the redevelopment of Gaza in accordance with what’s called the Comprehensive Plan – Trump’s 20-point blueprint.\n \n\n   \n  It’s as yet unclear who would serve on the BoP and just what its powers would be, according to diplomats familiar with the process.\n \n\n   \n  Former British Prime Minister  Tony Blair  was at one point being suggested as leading the board under Trump’s chairmanship, despite his damaged standing among some Arab states over his support for the Iraq war, and the feeling among many Palestinians that he is pro-Israel.\n \n\n   \n  According to Israeli officials last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Board would have no representatives of the Palestinian Authority, a rival to Hamas that runs parts of the occupied West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel and the US are the ones who decide if it will meet the conditions, and there’s an entire wall of conditions,” he was  quoted  as saying.\n \n\n   \n    Foreign troops\n \n\n   \n  The BoP along with member states would stand up a “temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza to deploy under unified command,” according to the draft, in close consultation with Israel and Egypt.\n \n\n   \n  It would ensure “the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” according to the draft.\n \n\n   \n  As the ISF “establishes control and stability,” the Israeli military would withdraw from Gaza “based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.”\n \n\n   \n  This is – in short – a hornet’s nest. The sequencing will be hard to manage, and the ISF will have to carry out the complex task of disarming Hamas and other factions, which still retain an array of rockets and heavy weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Some Hamas officials continue to rule out disarmament of the group’s military wing. Hamas fighters would be reluctant to give up light weapons to protect themselves from other groups in Gaza seeking retribution.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu has said that the BoP must take charge of Hamas’ disarmament and on Sunday reiterated that “Gaza will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed — either the easy way or the hard way.”\n \n\n   \n  Several countries have been tipped as likely contributors to an ISF in Gaza, including Indonesia, Turkey and Egypt. But none has committed a contingent, and there has been little public discussion about a command structure, nor about the ISF’s relationship with a Palestinian police force being trained in Egypt.\n \n\n   \n  Israel would very likely reject a Turkish role.\n \n\n   \n  The Americans themselves won’t contribute boots on the ground and are struggling to assemble an international force willing to enter Gaza to demilitarize the strip, according to an Israeli official. The US is now considering skipping over the demilitarization stage and moving straight to reconstruction, the official told CNN. Such a move would infuriate Israel because it would leave Hamas with its weaponry.\n \n\n   \n  That would undermine Washington’s own UN resolution and is unacceptable to Israel, the official said. The US was “moving toward interim solutions that Israel cannot accept.”\n \n\n   \n    The Palestinian role in Gaza\n \n\n   \n  According to the draft resolution, the BoP would at some point hand over to the Palestinian Authority (PA), when it “has satisfactorily completed its reform program.”\n \n\n   \n  The draft does not expand on what those reforms should be but refers to a joint  French-Saudi plan  that includes a commitment by the PA “to hold democratic and transparent general and presidential elections within a year” of the ceasefire in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, President Emmanuel Macron said France would help the Palestinian Authority draft a constitution for a future Palestinian state, part of a broader effort to promote a two-state solution.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli government wants a civilian administration in Gaza that is led by neither the PA nor Hamas. But it would be hard to find enough qualified Palestinians without allegiance to either group to lead the reconstruction of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n    A Palestinian State?\n \n\n   \n  The elephant in the room.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution says that depending on the PA’s progress “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.  The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.”\n \n\n   \n  There are plenty of caveats in the phrasing but the pathway remains a possibility, something the Trump administration discounted in its early days.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli government has made it clear it will not accept a Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of a cabinet meeting Sunday, Netanyahu repeated that “Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory west of the Jordan River exists, remains in force, and has not changed in the slightest.”\n \n\n   \n  Some far-right ministers have gone further. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Sunday: “There is no such thing as a ‘Palestinian people.’ It is an invention with no historical, archaeological, or factual basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia, which is expected to have a major role in financing the reconstruction of Gaza, takes the opposite view. Its powerful crown prince meets Trump this week.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi minister Manal Radwan told a conference in Bahrain two weeks ago: “A Palestinian state is a prerequisite for regional integration. We have said it many times.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/europe/ukraine-wine-winemakers-tradition-war-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-05:00","title":"Wine has long been made in Ukraine.

Now its winemakers are preserving tradition in the face of war \n       \n  By Charlotte Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Sergiy Klimov speaks about wine, his excitement is infectious, even to those with a less than sophisticated palate.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2014, Klimov has championed Ukrainian-made wine in numerous ways.\n \n\n   \n  He runs a chain of wine bars in the capital city, Kyiv, stocking only Ukrainian-produced wine. He is an ambassador for Ukrainian wine, promoting it overseas. And now he has his own vineyard in the village of Zarichanka in western Ukraine, where he experiments with grape cultivation and the winemaking process.\n \n\n   \n  Through sharing Ukrainian-made wine, Klimov feels he is  preserving and building on a tradition  connected to his ancestral land for thousands of years.\n \n\n   \n  “It became my mission,” he said. “I want to bring revolution to the industry.”\n \n\n   \n  Alongside its neighbors Moldova and Romania, and the wider region’s Georgia and Azerbaijan, Ukraine has been fertile winemaking ground for millennia. Archaeological digs have unearthed ancient Greek winemaking vessels, while fossilized remains of grape species found during other excavations date back to the 11th to 9th centuries BC.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most famously, Crimea was home to vineyards which sat at the foot of the southern peninsula’s mountains. After Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 many of the vineyards were lost and, in some cases, were mined and destroyed by Russian forces, said Anna Eugenia Yanchenko, a Ukrainian cultural scientist, sommelier, and wine researcher specializing in the history of her country’s wine.\n \n\n   \n  Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, its forces have destroyed more wineries, including Château Kurin in the south and ARTWINERY in the eastern city of Donetsk, Yanchenko said. Others, like the southern vineyard Prince Trubetskoy Winery and the Kyiv region’s Wineidea, experienced periods of occupation.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s winemaking capacity was significantly reduced as a result – but Klimov and others are determined to keep the industry not just alive but thriving.\n \n\n   \n  Their efforts are motivated in part by a desire to strengthen  Ukrainian national identity  in the face of Russia’s efforts to deny their country’s sovereignty.\n \n\n   \n  Now based in Warsaw, Poland, Yanchenko says little is known about who originally planted grapes millennia ago in what is now Ukraine, but that what matters is that it happened and that production continues.\n \n\n   \n  “Since winemaking appeared, the process of cultivating grapes and wine consumption has never ended here,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Another champion for the industry is Tania Olevska, who left Ukraine for London in July 2022, five months after Russia’s full-scale invasion. Having worked in the wine industry for some years in her native Ukraine, she decided to establish Ukrainian Wines Company UK, focused on importing Ukrainian wines to Britain. She attends wine fairs and exhibitions that winemakers who remain in Ukraine now struggle to get to.\n \n\n   \n  “Initially, the wines were rejected,” Olevska said of trying to rally interest. But after one Ukrainian winemaker sent two cases to be sampled at events, that all changed. “In 2023, we had an opportunity to showcase our wines at the London Wine Fair. Several winemakers came and there was a huge interest from the trade side. They liked the wines,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Wine enthusiast Klimov is not surprised by that. “Our territory is super-unique,” he said, explaining how the diversity of Ukraine’s landscape lends itself to complex and interesting flavors, “We have black soils, limestone, volcanic soil and more than 400 grape varieties,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Victoria Daskal, a wine writer and educator based in London, said she believes the rise in Ukrainian wine imports to the UK is in part due to awareness of the war, but also because of the diversity of the British wine market. “Many wine consumers are generally surprised to even learn that Ukraine is a wine-producing country, but they are interested in exploring new regions,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Ukrainian winemakers have some way to go to raise the profile of their vintages both globally and at home.\n \n\n   \n  Both Klimov and Yanchenko explained how the Soviet era limited the wine industry, when they said quantity was prioritized over quality.\n \n\n   \n  Before that, the Russian Empire’s ineffective tackling of grape phylloxera – an aphid-like pest which feeds on grapevine roots – caused great loss in Ukraine, as elsewhere in 19th-century Europe. The wine industry had also long been affected by uncertainty, as portions of the country came under the rule of invading nations including Lithuania, Poland and Russia between the 14 th  and 18 th  centuries before it fell entirely to Russian rule.\n \n\n   \n  In the 20 th  century, the Soviets brought everything into government ownership. Wine was still produced, but privately owned wineries were destroyed and replaced with mass manufacturing with no concern for quality. Ukraine’s winemaking reputation was quickly ruined, Yanchenko said.\n \n\n   \n  Now in the grips of another war, Ukraine is committed to defending its identity as a sovereign nation – an identity Russia is seeking to erase in the regions it has occupied,  rights groups say. \n \n\n   \n  That erasure is also reminiscent of the Soviet era, when the regime in Moscow controlled the historical narrative. “My parents didn’t learn much about the history of our land in school,” Yanchenko said. “We know so little about who we are. But through discoveries like the true history of winemaking we are slowly piecing together the bigger picture of ‘Who are Ukrainians?’”\n \n\n   \n  Which might be why when Klimov saw an opportunity to get his neighbors involved in winemaking, he seized it.\n \n\n   \n  “Kyiv is the capital of vertical vineyards,” he said, describing how grapevines, many of them planted in the early 20th century, still grow through the city’s buildings in certain areas.\n \n\n   \n  In late 2023, he called upon his neighbors to join him in collecting and contributing grapes grown on Kyiv’s streets and soon they’d gathered 200 kilograms (about 440 pounds) of the fruit.\n \n\n   \n  The result was 100 bottles of natural wine with low intervention, bottled and sold with a label designed by Ukrainian artist Waone. “It’s like a piece of art that never existed before,” Klimov said.\n \n\n   \n  All proceeds from the sales are donated to funds supporting Ukraine’s armed forces, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to show that Ukraine is a wine country. It has old roots, with wine on our streets,” Klimov said, adding that he hopes to make this communal effort a tradition.\n \n\n   \n  Yanchenko hopes the work she, and Klimov, now do to advocate for Ukrainian wines at home and overseas will re-shape the country’s image.\n \n\n   \n  “It serves as a bridge, connecting us to other nations by offering a taste of our history, traditions, and the uniqueness of our land,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a way to reconnect with our roots and proudly share what makes Ukraine truly special.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite some people’s doubts, Klimov says some Ukrainians are now starting to choose Ukraine-made products over international imports.\n \n\n   \n  Having attended wine fairs in Dusseldorf, London and other European cities, Klimov also says he has seen a shift in the tastes of non-Ukrainians, with more becoming interested in learning about Ukraine’s wine regions.\n \n\n   \n  According to Olevska, “People should try Ukrainian wines, not just because of the war, not just because of this grief, but just because it’s a good wine of a great quality, and it’s worth being on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Klimov feels that investing his time and expertise in this industry will support his nation’s wider war effort.\n \n\n   \n  “When you support Ukraine’s economy, you support Ukraine’s culture, and this is a very small step that everyone in this world can do for Ukraine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/americas/lecuadors-los-lobos-drug-trafficking-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:01:00-05:00","title":"Alleged Leader of Ecuadorian Drug Trafficking Gang Los Lobos Arrested in Spain","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The alleged leader of Ecuador’s most violent drug trafficking gang, Los Lobos—known as 'Pipo' Wilmer Geovanny Chavarría Barré—has been arrested in Spain as part of a coordinated operation involving Ecuador’s National Police and Spanish authorities.

White highlighted in the beloved book, in a statement Martha White shared with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandfather “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons,” said White, who is also her grandfather’s literary executor, in the statement. “He didn’t condone fearmongering.”\n \n\n   \n  And even as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who is from North Carolina, leaned into the “Charlotte’s Web” messaging  Sunday in an X post , Martha White slammed the agency for riding on the book’s coattails with a message antithetical to the story her grandfather told.\n \n\n   \n  “He believed in the rule of law and due process,” Martha White said of her grandfather.\n \n\n   \n  The move into North Carolina comes as agents have arrested thousands across the nation, including dozens in Charlotte, in immigration raids and deported nearly 200,000 people as of late August. The controversy highlights   the tension between the Trump administration efforts to arrest and deport immigrants it deems criminals and the work of civic and community groups highlighting residents’ rights.   \n \n\n   \n  The operation in Charlotte seeks to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,”  according to DHS .\n \n\n   \n  The crackdowns have led to sharp criticism from politicians and community organizations alike.\n \n\n   \n  “In Charlotte, we’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots, and off of our sidewalks,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein   said in a  social media message .\n \n\n   \n  Bovino cited Charlotte’s Web in his X post that gave a nod to agents involved in the operation: “Wherever the wind takes us. High, low. Near, far. East, west. North, south. We take to the breeze, we go as we please.” In the book, that’s when Charlotte’s babies hatch and fly off, leaving Wilbur to cry himself to sleep, only to find out the next morning that three spiders stayed to keep him company.\n \n\n   \n  White highlighted the message of generosity and inclusion that permeates the children’s tale: ‘“By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a little,” Charlotte says in the book. “Heaven knows anyone’s life can stand a little of that.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on Martha White’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    “Operation Charlotte’s Web” kicks off with 81 arrests\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte is the latest city in the Trump adminstration’s crosshairs to face an immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents on Saturday arrested 81 people in the city during a surge of immigration enforcement,  Bovino said Sunday .\n \n\n   \n  The arrests took place during a span of about five hours on Saturday, according to Bovino, who has been tasked with helping lead the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in multiple US cities.\n \n\n   \n  Many of those who were arrested over the weekend “had significant criminal and immigration history, are off the streets,”  Bovino said on X .\n \n\n   \n  Several businesses closed temporarily after the operation was announced, including a popular Colombian bakery that had shuttered its doors only once in the past 28 years.\n \n\n   \n  “I need to protect my customers. I need to protect my people. I need to protect myself and my family,” said Manuel “Manolo” Betancur, who closed his family bakery Saturday after seeing men in green uniforms chase and tackle people outside the shop. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.\n \n\n   \n    Mom criticized use of daughter’s story for “Operation Midway Blitz”\n \n\n   \n   It’s not the first time Trump administration has been criticized for basing the name for an immigration operation on  someone’s story.\n \n\n   \n  The mother of the woman who became the face of Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago said  last month  her daughter would not have wanted to be associated with the crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security  said  it launched the enforcement push in honor of Katie Abraham, an Illinois woman who authorities say was killed in a drunken-driving hit-and-run crash by a man who was in the US illegally.\n \n\n   \n  Her mother, Denise Lorence, decided to speak out after realizing the operation’s association with her daughter wasn’t going away, she wrote in an  op-ed for the Chicago Tribune .\n \n\n   \n  “Losing a child unlocked a pain I never knew existed. Losing a child to a crime adds to the depths of despair,” she wrote. “Having my child’s legacy be associated with a politically charged and controversial operation instead of the positivity and light she contributed to those within her community is simply unbearable.”\n \n\n   \n  Her daughter would not want to be associated with the immigration crackdown in a city she loved and felt safe in, Lorence wrote in the op-ed titled “My daughter is the face of Operation Midway Blitz. I am reclaiming her legacy.”\n \n\n   \n  She said Abraham wasn’t political, she avoided confrontation and “was the person people wanted to be around,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Lorence acknowledged that Abraham’s father, Joe Abraham, and his wife agreed that Katie’s name could be used for the operation. Joe Abraham previously  told CNN  the federal government failed to”miserably” in protecting his daughter and that state politicians ignored her death, and by extension, “let it happen.”\n \n\n   \n  “Whether or not you agree with Operation Midway Blitz is not the story I am here to write,” Lorence wrote, but “she did not choose to be thrust into this political spotlight to advance an operation she knew nothing about.”\n \n\n   \n  Martha White also emphasized the distance between her grandfather’s work and those trying to appropriate it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to know when to speak up,” she said in her statement, “to expose the lies or misperceptions (the rule of law still applies in Sanctuary Cities, by the way), and when to deny the limelight that feeds the cruelty.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-interview-apologizes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"21:39:00-05:00","title":"Humbly, I’m sorry: Marjorie Taylor Greene says she’s turning a new leaf after years of divisive comments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly apologized for her past use of toxic and divisive political rhetoric, including support for violent posts and Holocaust-related comparisons, and has committed to a new path of political kindness and unity.

Marjorie Taylor Greene said Sunday she will stop using “toxic” rhetoric, marking what would be a dramatic shift in a political brand hallmarked by derogatory comments.\n \n\n   \n  The commitment comes amid a rift with Donald Trump that has spilled into  public view , with the president attacking the Georgia Republican personally. Greene, meanwhile, has pivoted away from the Republican Party more broadly recently, criticizing the GOP on a number of fronts, including the party’s handling of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, Greene said she worried Trump’s rhetoric toward her could lead to violence against her.\n \n\n   \n  “The most hurtful thing (Trump) said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor, and that is so extremely wrong,” Greene said, “and those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed by Bash on why she didn’t speak out against Trump using such rhetoric until it was directed at her, Greene conceded that it was “fair criticism.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics; it’s very bad for our country,” Greene said. “It’s been something I’ve thought about a lot, especially since Charlie Kirk was assassinated.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene said she realized that she has participated in or supported heated rhetoric that has resulted in threats toward others, a point of reflection for her.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m only responsible for myself and my own words and actions … and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” Greene said. “I really want to just see people be kind to one another.”\n \n\n   \n    A long history of flagrant remarks\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s pivot represents a sharp departure from her typical conservative firebrand persona. She has previously spread offensive rhetoric about the Holocaust, lobbed personal insults during congressional proceedings and fought with fellow Republicans to the point her own caucus has pushed for  repercussions  for her acting out.\n \n\n   \n  Greene repeatedly indicated support for Facebook posts calling for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019, before she was elected to Congress, a CNN KFile  report revealed  in 2021. After CNN reached out to Greene at the time, her personal Twitter account posted a statement that did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments, but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page. The report  resulted in  her being removed from House committee assignments  until 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Also in 2021,  Greene compared  then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to continue to require House lawmakers to wear masks on the chamber floor to steps the Nazis took to control the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Greene  issued  a rare apology after that incident.\n \n\n   \n  She  was also ejected  from the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2023 in part because of fights she had with its members. She later brushed off her ouster, saying she didn’t “have time for the drama club.”\n \n\n   \n  In one of her more notorious incidents, Greene got into a fight during a committee markup in 2024, during which  she insulted   Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s personal appearance and verbally sparred with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n \n\n   \n  Greene refused to apologize when given the opportunity by the committee’s chair. The majority of Republicans on the panel eventually voted to allow Greene to continue speaking during the markup, though Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado joined Democrats in voting to have Greene silenced for the rest of the period.\n \n\n   \n  That was not the only time Boebert and Greene had a public disagreement. During an argument on the House floor in 2023, Greene  called Boebert  “a little b*tch.”\n \n\n   \n  Beyond her colleagues, Greene also  snapped  at a British journalist to “go back to your country” after the reporter asked about the Signal chat controversy involving Trump administration officials earlier this year\n \n\n   \n  Greene said Sunday she’s done participating in politics in that way, adding that America needs to find “a new path forward,” and calling on people “to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/gluesenkamp-perez-garcia-retirement","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:43:00-05:00","title":"Lawmaker Calls for Accountability Over Timing of Fellow House Democrat’s Retirement: ‘Election Subversion Is Wrong’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has called for accountability within the Democratic Party over the timing of fellow Representative Chuy García’s retirement announcement, which occurred on November 4, 2025.

Almost all the 23,000 donated items went to the National Museum of Korea and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, whose curators collaborated with the Smithsonian for this exhibition. After the gift was announced, South Korea’s government unveiled plans for an entire  new museum  in Seoul to display the collection, which it hopes will “strengthen Korea’s brand identity as a cultural powerhouse.”\n \n\n   \n  The Washington, DC exhibition includes several sections dedicated to Korea’s last royal kingdom, the Joseon dynasty, which lasted from 1392 to 1910. Curators showcase the tastes and morals of the scholarly elite through court art and ceremonial objects, offering a look at the ideals, aesthetics and patronage systems that shaped Korean culture. The show also considers Buddhism and its legacy on the Korean peninsula, as well as modern artists’ attempts to grapple with the  Korean War  and monumental changes happening in the country and globally.\n \n\n   \n    An identity formed\n \n\n   \n  Some items from the Washington, DC exhibition will also be displayed in Chicago and London next year amid growing global fascination with all things Korean, from  K-beauty  to K-pop.\n \n\n   \n  “It is fantastic that Korea is making this global contribution to popular culture the way it is, but you know, Korean culture didn’t start 10 or 15 years ago, right?” said Chase F. Robinson, director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art, over a video call. “There are deep, deep reservoirs or veins of, especially, Korean visual culture. This is an opportunity to see that in play.”\n \n\n   \n  The exhibition, Robinson added, will “play an important role in filling out that understanding, and (in) seeing some of those pre-modern traditions that feed into these millennia of creative dynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  The theme is particularly relevant given the growing size, influence and cultural power of Asian American communities in the United States, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the objects are being exhibited outside of Korea for the first time, organizers said.\n \n\n   \n  “That there is this heritage that is so multi-dimensional and so rich — to bring it all together and show the significance — I think is what is notable, remarkable,” said Carol Huh, the museum’s associate curator of contemporary Asian art, over a video call.\n \n\n   \n  Huh’s interest and specialty is the work of 20th- and 21st-century artists who addressed modernization and a rapidly changing political landscape. It is a period in which Korea, having had very little contact with the wider world for centuries, suddenly found itself being influenced by forces and trends far beyond its immediate neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  Within 100 years, the country went from being an imperial dynasty to a Japanese colony, to two independent states after the peninsula was divided into a Russian-controlled north and US-administered south after World War II. South Korea is now a liberal democracy, while the North is a totalitarian state run by Kim Jong Un.\n \n\n   \n  “They were very much at the core of this complicated history of trying to understand what it is to be an artist in Korea,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Huh said the Lees’ bequest fills a gap in the history of contemporary Korean art with work by nearly 300 20th-century artists included. It was, she added, a period of identifying and asserting distinctly Korean cultural forms.\n \n\n   \n  Among the Smithsonian’s selection is work by artists like Kim Whanki, a well-known figure in the monochrome Dansaekhwa movement, whose members — having lived through Korea’s liberation from Japan, a civil war and the military dictatorship — used abstraction to avoid explicit meaning in their images, partly out of fear of strict government censorship. Also featured is Lee Ungno and Park Saengkwang, part of the antithetical Minjung art (or “the people’s” art) movement, which sought to advance democracy and social justice in the 1970s and 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  The Lee family “presciently sought out modern paintings at a time when only a few paid attention to them,” reads the exhibition catalog.\n \n\n   \n    A legacy collected\n \n\n   \n  Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul was partly motivated by the desire to repatriate art from Korean history. Many of the artifacts he acquired had, over the centuries, been sent abroad, lost or actively erased by the colonial Japanese government, which had even sought to outlaw the Korean language.\n \n\n   \n  “The cultural heritage of our nation should no longer be scattered or lost abroad,” he wrote in his autobiography.\n \n\n   \n  The Lees have made various gifts to museums across South Korea in recent decades. And even after its vast 2021 donation, the family retains a sizeable private collection, some of which is on display at the Samsung-run Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, where the family continues its collecting legacy.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Kun-hee’s art acquisitions were not without controversy: In 2007, he was accused by Kim Yong-chul, a former Samsung lawyer, of buying expensive artworks using company slush funds. That accusation, which Lee denied, set off an investigation into the former chairman that saw him convicted of tax evasion in 2008 (though prosecutors never brought bribery charges relating to the alleged slush funds).\n \n\n   \n  Like some of the artists in its collection, the Lee family also appeared to grapple with what it means to be Korean in a globalized era, and the collection gives glimpses into what the Lees, and their advisors, saw as part of Korean identity — and what they sought to project to the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Kun-hee is quoted in the exhibition catalog as saying: “When Korean identity permeates our daily lives, we will gain cultural competitiveness on the world stage.”\n \n\n   \n  His father, meanwhile, was known to write about how artworks excited him when he needed a spiritual lift, or would calm him down when he was excited or upset, said J. Keith Wilson, the Smithsonian’s curator of ancient Chinese art.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly, he had a very personal connection with Korean art of the past and was able to communicate with it in what seems to be like a spiritual way,” Wilson added.\n \n\n   \n   “ Korean Treasures: Collected, Cherished, Shared ” is showing at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC through February 1, 2026.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/china/china-japan-taiwan-takaichi-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-05:00","title":"China warns citizens against Japan travel as Taiwan spat escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has issued a travel advisory warning its citizens against visiting Japan, in response to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s controversial remarks suggesting that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival.

November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has warned its citizens against traveling to Japan as it escalates a backlash over comments by the country’s prime minister about the island of Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The dictum is Beijing’s most substantive retaliation yet to Sanae Takaichi’s remarks. Even as it may be more symbolic than anything, the move suggests Beijing is willing to wield its economic heft to press geopolitical points, a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  Recent “blatantly provocative remarks on Taiwan” have “further damaged the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges… creating additional risks to the safety and security of Chinese citizens in Japan,” a statement published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The ministry and its missions “remind Chinese citizens to refrain from visiting Japan for the time being,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Following the announcement, a number of Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern on Saturday published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Education also  advised its citizens  to exercise caution when making plans to study in Japan, citing a “worsening public security situation” in the country and claiming there had been a “surge in crimes targeting Chinese nationals.”\n \n\n   \n  The moves by Beijing are its latest displays of outrage in a  roughly week-long row  after Takaichi, in response to a question in Japan’s parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  China’s Ministry of Defense on Friday separately warned that Japan would “suffer a crushing defeat” if it dared to intervene militarily in the Taiwan Strait.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s travel warning was mirrored on Saturday by authorities in the financial hub Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, with residents there  urged  to exercise caution in visiting Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  The travel advisory follows official protest from both sides related to the incident – with each country summoning the other’s ambassador – and a surge of vitriolic backlash against Takaichi from within China, where nationalist, anti-Japanese sentiment has been on the rise in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The falling-out comes less than two weeks after Takaichi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for the first time on the sidelines of an international summit and agreed to pursue constructive, stable ties.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A heavy price’\n \n\n   \n  The backlash was kicked off by China’s Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian, who last Saturday shared a news article about Takaichi’s remarks and commented “the dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  State media has since published a barrage of scathing commentaries and editorials, while rampant social media discussion has disparaged Takaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  A commentary from the People’s Liberation Army Daily published Saturday attacked Takaichi and said if Japan intervened militarily in the Taiwan Strait, China would give it a “head-on blow.” A PLA-affiliated X account also circulated comments translated into Japanese warning Japan would “pay a heavy price” in such a case.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo on Friday summoned China’s ambassador to Japan to protest Xue’s “highly inappropriate remarks” and demand Beijing take “appropriate actions,” its foreign ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing had a day prior summoned Japan’s ambassador to China, in a meeting where Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong said Takaichi’s comments had “seriously damaged the political foundation of China-Japan relations,” and slammed Japan for not retracting them.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Friday said there was no need to retract Takaichi’s comments, stressing that they were made within the context of a discussion on an “existential crisis situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Separately on Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important not only for Japan’s security but also for the stability of the international community.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Takaichi said her remarks were “hypothetical” and that she would refrain from making similar comments in parliament again.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, which is widely seen as aiming to establish itself as the dominant power in the region, looks warily at the American alliance with Japan when it comes to its own regional security and ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has called for closer security ties with the US and last month moved to accelerate the country’s defense build-up, but like previous Japanese prime ministers she must balance the country’s close economic ties to China.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/trump-sued-over-plans-to-paint-eisenhower-building-in-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"08:59:00-05:00","title":"Preservationists sue over Trump’s latest plans to refashion a federal building to match his aesthetic","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preservationists, including the DC Preservation League and Cultural Heritage Partners, have filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, demanding that any changes to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building — including painting it white — go through a mandatory federal historic preservation review process.

match his aesthetic \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:59 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Historic preservationists sued President Donald Trump over his plans to paint an ornate office building housing his staff next to the White House, warning the structure could be “irreversibly damaged.”\n \n\n   \n  The suit, filed Friday by the DC Preservation League and Cultural Heritage Partners, asks the US District Court for the District of Columbia to stop Trump and federal officials from making any changes to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building unless they go through a standard review process.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in an interview last week that he was putting the wheels in motion to paint the Eisenhower building, a sprawling, Gilded Age structure next door to the White House, a bright white.\n \n\n   \n  “Gray is for funerals,” he said, referring to the building’s granite exterior, noting that he didn’t know whether he would go through with it, but that he was getting costs and bids from painters.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll see. It’d be a great addition to Washington,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plans to paint the building signaled yet another effort to stamp his aesthetic tastes on structures on federal grounds. As part of those efforts, Trump has paved over the White House Rose Garden to create a Mar-a-Lago-esque patio, demolished the East Wing to  create a massive ballroom , and ordered the golden pillars of the Kennedy Center painted white. He has also touted plans to  install a triumphal arch  to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States’ founding.\n \n\n   \n  The suit argues the Trump administration cannot move forward with the president’s plans without going through “the environmental and historic preservation review that federal law requires.”\n \n\n   \n  Going around those reviews could result in irreversible damage, the groups argue. Painting stone “can trap moisture within the wall system” and accelerate deterioration, the suit says. It adds that if the building was painted, “removing paint from the natural granite and slate would require immense expense” and potentially result in the loss of the original material.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed plans of a white Eisenhower building “looked like a giant marshmallow,” said Greg Werkheiser, founding partner of Cultural Heritage Partners, the law firm that filed the suit.\n \n\n   \n  “But our complaint isn’t about the president’s taste,” Werkheiser said. “You can have really bad taste. You can have really good taste. What we’re asking for is you comply with the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Completed in 1888, the Eisenhower building originally housed the State, War and Navy departments, but now serves as ancillary office space for the president’s staff, including the Office of the Vice President, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget. The building’s interior includes 553 ornately gilded rooms, bronze stair balusters, hand-painted tiles, carved wooden fixtures, stained glass rotundas and intricate cast iron.\n \n\n   \n  But the building’s unique French Second Empire style has been controversial since its inception. It took roughly 17 years to build, and by the time it was done, “the Second Empire style had fallen from favor, and (architect Alfred) Mullett’s masterpiece was perceived by capricious Victorians as only an embarrassing reminder of past whims in architectural preference,”  according to  the Biden White House.\n \n\n   \n  Guides leading tourists around the White House complex are often heard quoting from the author Mark Twain, who reportedly described it as “the ugliest building in America.”\n \n\n   \n  And President Harry Truman called it a “monstrosity.”\n \n\n   \n  Werkheiser’s firm will ask for a preliminary injunction Monday on an emergency basis — but it will also ask the judge to issue a restraining order to prevent Trump from ordering alterations to the building until the court evaluates the case.\n \n\n   \n  Werkheiser’s team will seek to make the case that the Constitution “says the president is obligated to take care, to follow the laws,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “After the East Wing debacle, no reasonable person could say, ‘Well the president wasn’t on notice that these laws apply or that he needed to take additional care,’” he said. “The extensiveness of the outrage of that incident eliminates any excuse he has to pretend he can go quickly and avoid this process.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/world/iran-drought-cloud-seeding-dry-fall-climate-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"Iran turns to cloud-seeding as historic drought causes driest fall in 50 years","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing its worst drought in 50 years, with rainfall down 89% compared to the long-term average, leading to a severe water crisis.

Jesse Jackson remains hospitalized and has been receiving care to manage his blood pressure, sources close to Jackson’s family told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released late Sunday afternoon, the family said he is breathing on his own without the assistance of machines and not on life support. A separate source added that earlier he had been receiving medication to raise his blood pressure, which is a form of life support.\n \n\n   \n  In the last 24 hours, Jackson’s condition has improved and he has been able to maintain a stable blood pressure without the assistance of medication.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson, 84, a protégé of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., has been under observation for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), the Rainbow PUSH Coalition said Wednesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  Further details about his condition have not been released.\n \n\n   \n  The family source says Jackson has had brief moments of energy due to a medication he has been on for two days. Jackson had a significant drop in blood pressure Saturday night, but a medical team responded to him immediately, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Even while under treatment, he has shown brief but meaningful signs of responsiveness, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  In the Sunday afternoon statement, his son Yusef said: “In fact, today he called for 2,000 churches to prepare 2,000 baskets of food to prevent malnutrition during the holiday season.”\n \n\n   \n  Last week, there had been “significant improvement” in the civil rights leader’s condition under medical care, his son Jesse Jackson Jr. said Thursday in a segment during his weekday radio show.\n \n\n   \n  PSP is “a rare neurological disorder that affects body movements, walking and balance, and eye movements,” according to the  US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .\n \n\n   \n  The disease typically begins in a person’s 60s and has some symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease, it adds. Most people with PSP develop severe disability within three to five years.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson “has been managing this neurodegenerative condition for more than a decade,” the organization previously said in a statement. “He was originally diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease ;  however, last April his PSP condition was confirmed.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson rose to national prominence in the 1960s as a close aide to King. After King’s assassination in 1968, Jackson became one of the most transformative civil rights leaders in America.\n \n\n   \n  In 1971, he founded Operation PUSH as a way to improve Black communities’ economic conditions across the US. Jackson later launched the National Rainbow Coalition, in 1984, with the goal of obtaining equal rights for all Americans, according to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Twelve years later, the two organizations merged to form Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  One of Jackson’s signature phrases has been “Keep hope alive,” and was a force for social justice over three eras: the Jim Crow period, the civil rights era and the post-civil rights era, culminating with the election of Barack Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Amanda Musa contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/world/democratic-republic-of-congo-bridge-mine-collapse-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00-05:00","title":"At least 32 killed in southeastern DRC after bridge at mine collapsed, authorities say","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bridge at the Kalando mine in Mulondo, Lualaba province of the Democratic Republic of Congo collapsed on Saturday, killing at least 32 people and possibly as many as 40.

Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:34 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has said he believes Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s days are numbered, and that land strikes inside Venezuela are possible.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that the US doesn’t currently have the military assets in place to launch a largescale operation to remove Maduro from power, though Trump has approved covert action within Venezuela,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n  But if Trump did order strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, he could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency, according to experts, as well as political backlash at home for a president who promised to avoid costly entanglements overseas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Trump received a briefing earlier this week to review updated options for military action inside Venezuela, a concept the White House has been  weighing . The administration had not made a decision on whether to launch strikes, CNN reported, though the US military has moved more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded Operation Southern Spear in an announcement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The concentration of military assets and threats of further attacks beyond the  ongoing drug boat campaign  have served to increase pressure on Maduro, with administration officials saying he needs to leave office while arguing that he’s closely tied to the Tren de Aragua gang and leading drug trafficking efforts.\n \n\n   \n  But if Maduro does flee Venezuela or is killed out in a targeted strike, experts worry about a military takeover of the country or the boosting of another dictator similar to Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  There are other members of the Venezuelan Chavismo, the leftist political ideology of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez that Maduro has championed, who could take the reins and subject the country to even harsher rule, experts and former officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Maduro has said something to the effect of, ‘You want to get rid of me? You think things will get better?’ It is something to consider because Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo, and someone else could usurp power instead of the opposition with the backing of the military,” said Juan Gonzalez, a resident fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute who was a former Biden administration official focused on the region.\n \n\n   \n  Another possibility would be a military takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “If the military is still cohesive, and I don’t think we see any evidence it is not, they will not collapse because there is a challenge to or an ouster of Maduro,” said John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser in his first term. “They will follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, whose inner circle is made up of both civilians and military officers who are often in competition with each other, is known to have tight control over his administration and has helped stabilize competing factions. External forces, like Colombian insurgent groups who regularly operate from Venezuela or criminal syndicates linked to cocaine, gold and mineral trafficking further complicate the picture.\n \n\n   \n  Were Maduro to disappear, these pulls could tear the nation apart – descending into a potential civil war, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium,” said a Western diplomat who has spent years in Venezuela, asking to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss with the press. “Everyone knows he’s been politically dead since last year’s election, but if he leaves there’s nobody who can maintain the status quo … so they all close ranks around him.”\n \n\n   \n    Opposition Figures\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration may hope that Venezuelan opposition figures would be able to step into a power vacuum created by the removal of Maduro, something that the first Trump administration considered as it propped up Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. That first Trump administration officially recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela in 2019, but a failed coup attempt that year meant he never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  One current Venezuelan opposition group led by Edmundo Gonzalez, who ran for president last year in an election that  the US said Maduro lost , says it has a 100-hour plan to transition the power of Venezuela’s government from Maduro to Gonzalez. But experts say that they would be unable to succeed in the short-term or in the long-term without sustained US support – and potentially US boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible. There is no way to guarantee their safety or ability to govern without the US providing security,”  Juan Gonzalez said. “Everyone is viewing removing Maduro as the end but it’s really just the beginning of what would be a long, drawn-out process.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have also said that Edmuondo Gonzalez, who is currently residing in Spain, is the rightful leader of Venezuela, based on the results of last year’s election. The US has provided limited support to another Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who went into hiding in the country after the election. The assistance includes support, like gaining access to secure communication capabilities, former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  But in order to keep any of the potential opposition leaders in power the type of support needed from the US would go beyond providing a secure device – there would need to be assistance in reconstructing the army, unfreezing Venezuelan government funds and training their police force, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition’s enemies inside Venezuela are not limited to Maduro himself, which is why such sustained outside support is seen as a necessity, experts said. The opposition would face hostilities from the Venezuelan military; pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos; the National Liberation Army (known as the ELN), which is a Colombian guerilla group that currently has safe haven in the country; and other active criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how much support Trump would be willing to give any opposition leader who seeks to take the presidency from Maduro. But that support would need to be sustained, officials said, to fend off a failed state.\n \n\n   \n  Such an extended US military involvement runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump backs away from a potential opportunity to oust Maduro now, some believe it could be viewed as a lost opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump is calling Maduro a narcoterrorist and a drug trafficker, and has assembled a huge armada. If he backs down now and Maduro survives, there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine’ talk and the idea of being supreme in our own hemisphere.” said Elliott Abrams, a former senior State Department official in Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n    Entanglements\n \n\n   \n  Even while some say that displacing Maduro could be done without US troops on the ground for an extended period, they say that the US commitment following any kinetic strikes needs to be long-lasting or else the effort could easily fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “If the force is decisive it can disband a full army. But whatever is done cannot be done with a short-term perspective. The use of force needs to create a result and be connected to a political solution with US support, and planning for that support for 5-10 years,” said a regional diplomat.\n \n\n   \n  The Maduro regime is propped up in different ways by Russia, China and Cuba. Experts worry that if US strikes hit assets of those nations the conflict could quickly escalate. While it is unlikely that any of those nations would send their troops to the region to defend against US strikes, it is possible that the effect of US strikes inside Venezuela could be blunted by the support those countries provide to the regime.\n \n\n   \n  All three nations have invested in the Venezuelan regime and have instruments that they could bring to bear to prevent Maduro’s ouster, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  This is something that has happened in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2019, the opposition thought that the Cubans had uncovered what they were trying to do with their coup attempt and believe that they made moves to undermine their efforts,” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  Further expanding the problem could be a move by Maduro to hit US assets in the region – before the US makes any move to directly oust him.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a chance that if Maduro thinks he is going down he might make a move to hit something the US cares about, such as oil platforms in the Caribbean Sea. It could be a gamble he may be willing to take that would harm US interests in the region,” said Henry Ziemer, a regional expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Publicly the Trump administration continues to point to its buildup of military assets in Latin America as supremely focused on counter-drug operations – not an ouster of Maduro. Experts have also  previously told CNN  that the assembled hardware and troops aren’t enough for a full-scale invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Still, when asked earlier this month if the US might get into a war with Venezuela, Trump gave an ambiguous answer, saying: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/us-military-drug-boat-strike-21","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"15:57:00Z","title":"US military carried out 21st strike on alleged drug boat, killing 3","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military conducted its 21st strike on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel in the Eastern Pacific, killing three individuals identified as narco-terrorists.

late singer \n       \n  By Sofía Hanalei Sanchez\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  First, there was the 1997 Gregory Nava biopic starring Jennifer Lopez. Then, there was the  scripted Netflix series  that came out in 2020. Now, the late Queen of Tejano music,  Selena Quintanilla Perez , is having her story told directly by her family and bandmates.\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, we have her sister Suzette Quintanilla to thank for “Selena y Los Dinos,” the Netflix documentary debuting Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the annoying one with the camera, like, back in the day,” Quintanilla told CNN in a recent interview. “I have so much footage of all the guys giving me that look like, ‘Ugh, not again.’”\n \n\n   \n  In the ‘80s and ‘90s, Quintanilla, now the CEO of her family’s entertainment company Q Productions, was the drummer in her family’s up-and-coming band, which serves as the inspiration for the documentary’s title. She had a camera and a desire to document her family and bandmates’ silly moments on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “(I) wasn’t even thinking about creating (or) capturing these moments for what’s being showcased. It was just about documenting our life,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Those smile-stealing, off-the-cuff camcorder moments make what could have been a stale documentary into a much more personal portrait of the singer, who was  killed in 1995 . “Selena y Los Dinos” – inspired by the name of the band her father was in when he was a young musician – is packed with intimate glimpses of treasures from the family’s personal trove of video, photos and other never-before-seen footage.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a part in the documentary where I’m reading a letter that she wrote to me,” the late singer’s bandmate and eventual husband Chris Perez told CNN. “I was just happy to be a part of it and have the crew come over here and talk to me in that kind of respect.”\n \n\n   \n  Between home videos, deep-cut interviews, love letters – and even looks at Quintanilla Perez’s handwritten study notes from when she was learning Spanish to better connect with her Mexican audience – the documentary reminds viewers of the person behind the star’s story, which ended too soon.\n \n\n   \n  The documentary details the Texas-born singer’s triumphs and struggles in equal measure – like how she broke through sexism, racism and poverty in the male-dominated Tejano music scene in the late 1980s to become one of the first American musicians of Latino descent to cross over from the Spanish to English market. Her fifth studio album – featuring her two widely known English hits, “Dreaming of You” and “I Could Fall in Love” – was released after her death.\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, at the age of 23 and already a Grammy winner, Quintanilla Perez was shot and killed by her fan club president  Yolanda Saldívar, who was denied parole  earlier this year. Still, in her short life, she refracted light, relatability and charisma that continues to capture millions today.\n \n\n   \n  To put it all into context, before there was  Bad Bunny -mania, there was Ricky Martin’s Latin Explosion. And before that, there was Selena Quintanilla Perez.\n \n\n   \n  While all the fame, glory and tragedy is implicit in Selena’s story, the director of the new documentary was going for something more.\n \n\n   \n  “(The documentary is) not the ‘Hollywoodification’ of their story, it’s them telling their stories to you directly,” director Isabel Castro told CNN’s host of “First of All,” Victor Blackwell. “ It was really important to us that we make something that felt different from things that have been made in the past.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of those differences include a more complete picture of Quintanilla Perez as an empowered and empowering female artist in the early ’90s. In one archival snippet, an older, male host asks the young singer – wearing a scarlet red bustier and matching leggings – to do “a turn” for the audience. After doing a quick, elegant twirl, she requests the same of him, even encouraging the audience to egg him on. He does not spin, but her point was made.\n \n\n   \n  There are also candid moments from her childhood, including interviews in which she speaks honestly about the pressure on her and her siblings to financially deliver for the family.\n \n\n   \n  Directed by Castro and executive produced by siblings Suzette and AB Quintanilla III, the project captures Quintanilla Perez and her band’s rise and her ultimate triumph: a global legacy beyond her lifespan.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘real’ Selena\n \n\n   \n  Quintanilla Perez is not at risk of being forgotten any time soon, of course. Her name seemingly still carries the crowd-gathering power it did at the height of her popularity.\n \n\n   \n  When MAC Cosmetics launched a makeup collection inspired by the star, it  sold out within a day . The ceremony revealing her pink star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame attracted a  record-breaking attendance . And when Texas grocery store chain H-E-B released a limited quantity of special-edition reusable bags lines honoring the singer, the  website crashed and stores were sold out  for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  For Quintanilla, though, honoring her sister in the documentary was about highlighting the human more than the hype.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, the lasting interest in Quintanilla Perez has collided with more advanced tools, like  artificial intelligence,  in tributes that may give her a voice again in some ways, but still miss the resonant mark, according to Quintanilla.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I do see the AI stuff,” she said. “Some of the stuff is just incredible, but the beauty of what she brings as a person and as an artist, AI can never replicate that. They can emulate her physical look, but there ain’t nothing better than the real thing.”\n \n\n   \n  In true Mexican tradition, the “Amor Prohibido” singer’s story is being told – and retold – to new generations in hopes of her life never being forgotten.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s basically taking this time capsule and bringing it to 2025. I do understand the significance of the younger fan base that’s searching Selena and wanting to know more about her,” said Suzette Quintanilla. “And throughout the years, things have been blurred.”\n \n\n   \n  She added: “ I think that’s one of the reasons why this documentary is extremely important because if anybody is new that’s discovering Selena, they’re not discovering an AI version. Clearly, this is the real Selena.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/indian-americans-racism-maga-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00-05:00","title":"Racists Are Now Openly Targeting Indian Americans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A surge of racist and xenophobic attacks against Indian Americans has emerged on the U.S. political right, fueled by public Diwali posts from high-profile figures such as FBI Director Kash Patel, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and Vice President JD Vance.

openly targeting Indian Americans \n       \n  By Harmeet Kaur, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:05 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Last month, FBI Director Kash Patel wished his followers on  X  a happy Diwali. It did not go over well.\n \n\n   \n  Far-right Christian nationalist and white nationalist accounts flooded his post with bigoted memes and rhetoric. “Go back home and worship your sand demons,” a far-right pastor wrote. “Get the f**k out of my country,” read another reply. Said another, “This is America. We don’t do this.” These responses, some of which were seen millions of times, were on the tamer end of the spectrum.\n \n\n   \n  Similar hostility followed Diwali greetings on X from former UN ambassador  Nikki Haley , former presidential candidate  Vivek Ramaswamy  and Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights  Harmeet Dhillon , as well as posts about the holiday from the  White House , the  State Department , Texas Gov.  Greg Abbott  and Arkansas Gov.  Sarah Huckabee Sanders .\n \n\n   \n  Some Indian American conservatives seem shocked that segments of the political right are now taking aim at them. When Democrats won big on election night, Ramaswamy  advised  Republicans to “cut out the identity politics,” saying “we don’t care about the color of your skin or your religion. We care about the content of your character.” After one X user said that the existence of Indians disgusted them, Dinesh D’Souza, the right-wing commentator who has peddled  racism  against  Black Americans  for decades,  mused : “In a career spanning 40 years, I have never encountered this type of rhetoric. The Right never used to talk like this. So who on our side has legitimized this type of vile degradation?”\n \n\n   \n  This type of degrading rhetoric is  not   new , but it’s increasingly prominent from the  political right . With the rise of  once-fringe figures , and with President Donald Trump aggressively cracking down on  nearly   every type of immigration , some members of the MAGA coalition are openly suggesting that only white Christians belong in America.\n \n\n   \n  “The call is coming from inside the house,” said Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan, an editorial manager and analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue who has examined anti-Indian hate speech and the far right online.\n \n\n   \n  Indian immigrants and Indian Americans — or anyone perceived as Indian — are the latest target of a growing anti-migrant movement in the US and  around   the world . Over the past year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Organized Hate have documented a  surge  of  anti-Indian sentiment  on X that is showing no signs of abating. Raqib Naik, the center’s founder and executive director, said that his team recorded nearly 2,700 posts promoting racism and xenophobia against Indians and Indian Americans in October alone. At least some of that might be explained by Elon Musk’s transformation of the platform: Since he took over, racist content that would previously have been policed by content moderators is now amplified and encouraged. (X did not respond to a request for comment.)\n \n\n   \n  As with the Diwali outrage, these attitudes flare up at times when India or Indians are in the news: Trump’s appointment of  Sriram Krishnan  as senior adviser on artificial intelligence, Ramaswamy criticizing American culture as mediocre in a  social media post , escalations in the  US-India trade war  and a  fatal accident  in Florida involving a Sikh truck driver.\n \n\n   \n  But the most consistent anti-Indian bigotry online focuses on the H-1B visa program, of which Indian nationals are the  biggest beneficiaries , Naik and other researchers said. The program, which admits highly skilled foreigners into the US to work in specialized fields, has sparked  infighting among Trump supporters , with visa opponents such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller  accusing  India of “a lot of cheating on immigration policies.” While the president’s stance on the issue has fluctuated, he recently restricted access to H-1B visas by imposing a  $100,000 application fee .\n \n\n   \n  Far-right accounts and actors now routinely frame Indian immigrants as scammers who are depriving Americans of high-paying jobs and call to deport them. They accuse Indians of hiring only within their caste or ethnicity, invoke stereotypes about Indians being dirty or smelly, and highlight behaviors like eating with one’s hands as cultural backwardness. It isn’t just far-right trolls who invoke these tropes — during the recent New York City mayoral race, the independent campaign of former Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo released (then quickly deleted) an  AI-generated attack ad  depicting Zohran Mamdani sloppily eating rice with his hands.\n \n\n   \n   Slurs directed at South Asians,  some of which originated on the largely unmoderated online forum 4chan, are  surging  and entering the lexicon, both online and offline. Photos and videos selectively showing Indian-origin people in public places are held up as evidence of an “invasion,” another iteration of white “ replacement theory .” These attitudes didn’t emerge in a vacuum. Even before Trump was first elected, powerful figures in his movement including Steve Bannon and Miller were referencing the 1970s novel “ The Camp of the Saints ” as a cautionary tale — in the book, a favorite of white supremacists, a fleet of Indian migrants led by a feces-eating farmer invades France and overthrows the Western world.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop of racist and  economic grievance , the success and prominence of Indian Americans make them an easy target, said Rohit Chopra, a professor at Santa Clara University who studies far-right online communities and who co-authored the reports for the Center for the Study of Organized Hate with Naik. Indian immigrants and Indian Americans are among the  highest-earning  ethnic groups in the US, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of census data. They’ve ascended to top government posts and are CEOs of billion-dollar companies. They’re represented at the highest levels of media, entertainment, technology, business, medicine and academia.\n \n\n   \n  “The public image of the Indian community has been that of these basically successful tech professionals and CEOs,” Chopra said. “And the Indian community and Indian American community significantly plays up that image too.”\n \n\n   \n  This image certainly doesn’t reflect all Indian Americans, a religiously and ethnically diverse group that includes US citizens, legally authorized visa workers, international students and undocumented migrants. But as long-simmering resentment against affluent Indian Americans metastasizes into a demonization of the entire community, Chopra said there’s a danger that this could inspire real-world violence.\n \n\n   \n    Indian Americans are feeling the hostility offline\n \n\n   \n  Already, anti-Indian attitudes online are spilling over into everyday life.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, a city councilmember in  Palm Bay, Florida,  repeatedly denigrated Indians and called for their mass deportation on social media, leading to censure and calls for his removal. In Irving, Texas, a Dallas suburb home to thousands of Indian tech professionals, three masked men staged a  roadside protest  carrying signs that read “Don’t India My Texas,” “Deport H-1B Visa Scammers” and “Reject Foreign Demons.”\n \n\n   \n  Stephanie Chan, Stop AAPI Hate’s director of data and research, recounted a recent conversation with a South Asian community leader in Texas who told her white supremacist groups were harassing people outside Hindu temples. Stop AAPI Hate co-founder Manjusha Kulkarni said she overheard people at a Diwali party talking about readying their OCI cards — which allow foreign citizens of Indian origin to live and work in India indefinitely — just in case.\n \n\n   \n  Racist incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate this year and shared with CNN also suggest that anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump and parts of his coalition is inspiring hostility. One woman in Georgia shared that a fellow customer at a fast food restaurant threatened to call ICE to get her deported back to India. Another woman in Texas reported that a man who came into her workplace yelled profanities at her and a coworker, saying “I am glad Trump is deporting you b*tches. I hope you have a green card.”\n \n\n   \n  Salil Maniktahla, an Indian American who lives in Springfield, Virginia, said he was similarly accosted while dining at a restaurant with a friend earlier this year. A man hurled slurs at him, said Trump was president and told him to “go home” and “do Bharatanatyam,” referring to a South Indian classical dance. The man also threatened them with violence and waited for them outside, resulting in Maniktahla’s friend calling the police.\n \n\n   \n  “What I see now is that a lot of people are mouthing off in ways that they felt they were prevented from doing prior to 2016,” Maniktahla said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about backlash to officials’ Diwali posts online, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “The President is a fierce defender of religious liberty and cherishes his deep and longstanding relationship with this patriotic community.” As racist, nativist and anti-immigrant rhetoric continues to proliferate on the right, Trump and Vice President JD Vance have done little to quell it.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, whose wife Usha Vance is Indian American,  dismissed  remarks from a government staffer such as “normalize Indian hate” as  youthful indiscretion .\n \n\n   \n  Vance has also furthered ideas underlying such bigotry, though with more delicate language. In a  speech  at the Claremont Institute in July, he ruminated on what it meant to be an American. Merely embracing the nation’s foundational principles was not enough, he said, because it would potentially open the country to millions of foreigners and exclude some on the right who reject those same ideals. A better criterion might be  one’s heritage , he added: “I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong.”\n \n\n   \n  In the speech, Vance conceded that there was room in the US for some immigrants, so long as they demonstrated sufficient gratitude. Too many, though, would threaten the fabric of the nation, he argued. “And what we’re doing is recognizing that if you stop importing millions of foreigners into the country, you allow that social cohesion to form naturally,” he said. “It’s hard to become neighbors with your fellow citizens when your own government keeps on importing new neighbors every single year at a record number.”\n \n\n   \n  At this year’s White House Diwali celebration, Kash Patel used a conspicuous turn of phrase — one seemingly meant to distinguish himself from another kind of immigrant.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an honor to be a first-generation Indian American whose parents lawfully immigrated to this country,”  he said .\n \n\n   \n  To some Trump supporters responding online to his remarks, it didn’t seem to matter that Patel’s parents entered the US legally or that he was a dutiful member of the Trump administration. “Go celebrate your foreign gods back home in India. America is a Christian nation,” one user wrote. Said another, “Hard to think of something less American. This is an abomination.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that sections of the Indian American community have been living in this fool’s paradise,” Chopra said.\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “This should serve as a kind of wake-up call — that racism that’s directed at people of color and minority groups, you are not exempt from. And maybe that should spark some kind of reflection about questions of solidarity with other vulnerable groups.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/americas/genz-protests-mexico-sheinbaum-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:25:00-05:00","title":"Thousands protest crime and corruption in Mexico City as 'Gen Z' protests gain momentum","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of protesters, primarily from Generation Z but including older citizens, gathered in Mexico City to protest crime, corruption, and impunity.

Supreme Court weighs Trump’s tariffs \n       \n  By Auzinea Bacon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:40 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s proposal to issue  $2,000 tariff rebate checks  to most Americans   would require Congress’ approval.\n \n\n   \n  “We will see. We need legislation for that,” Bessent said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” when asked about rebate checks, adding that “Those could go out.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly suggested using tariffs to fund rebate checks in recent months, including in a  Truth Social  post last weekend. “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! … A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” he wrote. Trump first floated the idea of Americans potentially  receiving a portion of the tariff revenue  in July.\n \n\n   \n  The payments would be “for working families” and would have an income limit, Bessent said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  But  the Supreme Court  could strike down a large chunk of Trump’s tariffs when it decides on the president’s use of an emergency law. The court appeared deeply concerned earlier this month with Trump’s reliance on the law, with several conservative justices picking apart the administration’s position.\n \n\n   \n  The tariffs have faced scrutiny for contributing to higher inflation on consumer goods, though Bessent and others in Trump’s economic team have denied that  tariffs are essentially a tax on American consumers .\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think this ruling is going to go against us, but if it does, what’s (the Supreme Court’s) plan for refunds? Because how is this going to get to consumers? Are they just going to hand some of these importers big windfalls?” Bessent said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think the Supreme Court wants to wade into a mess like that,” Bessent added.\n \n\n   \n    A trade agreement with China\n \n\n   \n  The United States has yet to sign a trade deal with China on rare-earth minerals, which are   essential to making consumer electronics and military equipment, after months of trade tensions between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent said a deal will “hopefully” be done by Thanksgiving after a framework agreement was  announced in October . That agreement averted additional 100% tariffs that the US threatened on Chinese goods, but only if Beijing ends current and proposed export controls on critical rare earths.   \n \n\n   \n  Bessent said Sunday that the agreement would allow rare earths to “flow freely as they did before April 4,” when the trade war kicked off due to Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs.\n \n\n   \n    Bessent says shutdown set back economy\n \n\n   \n  The longest government shutdown in US history  came to an end  Wednesday after Congress narrowly passed a spending package.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course the government shutdown set us back,” Bessent said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent did not say whether he expected a weak GDP for the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  The first two quarters of 2026, though, will see inflation down and the real income curve “substantially accelerate,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n  “When those two lines cross, Americans are going to feel it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    More expensive groceries leading into the holidays\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration on Friday announced that many agricultural imports would be  exempt from “reciprocal” tariffs  instead of rates as high as 50% on imports from Brazil or the lowest 10% duty imposed on many other countries, potentially providing a solution to rising grocery costs.\n \n\n   \n  Average grocery prices in the US were  2.7% higher in September  compared with last year. Coffee prices, for instance, were up nearly  21% year-over-year  in August, and bananas were about  6.6% more expensive in August  than they were a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “The prices will go down, of course … because the supply of goods into the US is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  The  consumer sentiment index fell  to 50.3 this month from 53.6 in October, according to the University of Michigan — a sobering sign leading into the holiday season.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/media/pbs-ken-burns-american-revolution-paula-kerger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-05:00","title":"PBS, defunded by Trump, says ‘we’re still here’ with big new Ken Burns documentary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of President Donald Trump’s successful effort to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), PBS has launched a major new documentary by Ken Burns, 'The American Revolution,' as a bold statement of endurance.

 \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:29 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sunday’s premiere of Ken Burns’ new PBS series “The American Revolution” doubles as an attention-grabbing statement, months after President Donald Trump succeeded in stripping away all federal funding for public broadcasting in the US.\n \n\n   \n  The message is clear: “We are still here.”\n \n\n   \n  The documentary, which airs over six consecutive nights, is “a really big moment” for PBS, said Paula Kerger, the organization’s CEO.\n \n\n   \n  There has been some marketplace confusion as a result of Trump’s campaign to defund public media.\n \n\n   \n  Since the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is winding down as a consequence of the funding cut, “people thought that meant that we were gone,” Kerger said.\n \n\n   \n  However, the big and loud marketing campaign for “The American Revolution” is proving otherwise.\n \n\n   \n  Despite painful layoffs and other cost-cutting measures, the public broadcasting system remains intact and is still capable of HBO- and Netflix-sized moments, such as the latest from Burns.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Water under the American bridge’\n \n\n   \n  “The American Revolution,” pegged to America’s 250th anniversary celebration in 2026, has been in the works for 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  “We began this in December of 2015 when Barack Obama had 13 months to go in his presidency,” Burns told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “There’s been a lot of water under the American bridge during this time.”\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term in office, he repeatedly proposed eliminating funding for the CPB, but congressional Republicans preserved the funds, in part to protect the local stations serving their constituents.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was much more aggressive this year, however. Driven by his disdain for PBS and NPR news coverage, Trump pushed GOP lawmakers to rescind already-allocated funds for the CPB, which is the private entity that disburses taxpayer funds to local NPR and PBS stations across the country.\n \n\n   \n  That rescission passed in July, and the federal funds dried up in October, marking an end to nearly 60 years of federal government support for public media.\n \n\n   \n  Some local stations are more affected than others. Those in bigger markets generally have more donors and other sources of revenue; those in smaller markets have fewer such resources. Public media officials have warned that stations in rural and hard-to-reach areas are at particular risk of going off the airwaves in the months and years ahead.\n \n\n   \n  In the short term, however, emergency grants and loans from the Knight Foundation and other philanthropies are helping replace some of the lost funds.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on stage at the Texas Tribune Festival, Kerger said that fundraising “has actually gone pretty well,” emphasizing that PBS is still pushing Congress to restore funding in the future.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe we can get some of that money back,” Kerger said. “And I’m going to certainly fight like crazy” for it.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Where’d you come from?’\n \n\n   \n  The rescission took effect as Burns was beginning his nationwide tour for “The American Revolution.”\n \n\n   \n  The six-part, twelve-hour series is the highest-profile PBS premiere in years, garnering multiple weeks of publicity, including advance screenings across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the kind of work that public broadcasting is built to do,” Kerger said. She recounted a recent screening in Washington, where conservative lawmakers stood alongside progressives wanting to meet Burns.\n \n\n   \n  “It bugged me a little bit that some of them voted against us and they were still waiting to shake Ken’s hand,” Kerger remarked, “but the point is they recognize that what he’s doing is important.”\n \n\n   \n  A sweeping production like “The American Revolution” involves a long list of private donors, as well as support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n \n\n   \n  During the congressional debate over the summer, Burns personally called some Republican lawmakers to try to salvage the funding.\n \n\n   \n  “I couldn’t do any of the films I’ve done without them being on PBS,” he told CBS at the time.\n \n\n   \n  James Poniewozik,  reviewing the series  for The New York Times, wrote that “it is dedicated to a belief that seems increasingly old-fashioned: that we share a common story and that people are willing to hear it, both the good and the bad.”\n \n\n   \n  Burns told Cooper that reflecting on your roots, as the series does, can be a source of strength and power.\n \n\n   \n  “When you feel like we’re challenged, as we do now, that we’re divided, you go back, as a person would, to a therapist and ask, ‘Where’d you come from?’ And going back to our origin story gives us the opportunity to help repair, maybe revitalize what it was that we were originally involved in, to dispel some of the myths about it and to also help understand how extraordinary those people were.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/science/meteor-shower-leonids-november","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000Z","title":"The Leonid meteor shower is peaking early this week.

You may start glimpsing meteors at 11 p.m. Sunday local time, which is when the constellation Leo rises over the horizon. But it’s best to watch for them between 4 a.m. Monday and sunrise local time, said Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society.\n \n\n   \n  “Unlike a lot of (meteor) showers, the Leonids have a very sharp peak,” Lunsford said, adding there is only one good night for viewing.\n \n\n   \n  The Leonids’ parent comet,  55P/Tempel-Tuttle , is to thank for this  brief duration. The size of the comet’s debris trail is small, so Earth passes through it for a short amount of time.\n \n\n   \n  The meteors you’ll see around 11 p.m. Sunday will be Earth grazers, Lunsford said, which means they’ll last longer than normal and will shoot across a large portion of the sky. “But you won’t see as many because a lot of the Leonid activity will be shooting downward below the horizon,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Under clear weather conditions, you can expect to see 10 to 15 meteors per hour.\n \n\n   \n    Showers and storms\n \n\n   \n  While a meteor shower is expected this year, the Leonids are known for occasionally producing tremendous meteor storms, with at least 1,000 meteors per hour.\n \n\n   \n  The last  Leonid meteor storm  was in 2002. However, one of the most memorable storms occurred in 1966 when “we passed right through the center of one of the Leonid streams and rates were estimated at 40 meteors per second,” Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n  That storm had meteor activity so prevalent in the sky that meteors appeared to fall like rain.\n \n\n   \n  High meteor activity coincides with when the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle reaches perihelion — its closest approach in orbit to the sun. It takes the comet 33 years to orbit the sun, so the larger Leonid meteor showers — and sometimes storms — tend to occur about every 33 years.\n \n\n   \n  For a storm to happen, Earth has to pass through a dense part of the comet’s debris during perihelion, but sometimes our planet only skims the outskirts.\n \n\n   \n  The next shower that will coincide with the comet’s orbital cycle will take place in 2033, but it is not expected to be a storm, Lunsford said. “We may see rates of around 100 an hour, which is comparable to the Geminids,” he said, “but we certainly don’t expect any storms which are 1,000 meters an hour.”\n \n\n   \n    Upcoming meteor showers\n \n\n   \n  Here are the peak dates of the two remaining meteor showers anticipated this year, according to the  American Meteor Society  and  EarthSky. \n \n\n   \n    Upcoming supermoon\n \n\n   \n  Look out for  the last full supermoon  this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/new-orleans-clerk-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00-05:00","title":"A New Orleans Man Who Had His Murder Conviction Tossed Wins Election as City’s Chief Record Keeper","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Calvin Duncan, a New Orleans man wrongfully convicted of a 1981 murder, spent decades fighting to clear his name before having his conviction overturned in 2021.

An  early US intelligence assessment  suggested the three nuclear facilities had been badly damaged, but that Iran’s nuclear program may have only been set back by up to two years.\n \n\n   \n  While Khatibzadeh said that Israeli and US strikes had “ruined many of our infrastructure, machineries” and “buildings,” he noted that the nuclear program was “very much based on our indigenous knowledge, very much spread across our country, which is a huge country – 90 million people.”\n \n\n   \n  “And this country is not a country that you can bomb and then think that you are going to ruin everything,” the minister said.\n \n\n   \n  Khatibzadeh’s assessment comes as Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, said Sunday that no uranium enrichment was taking place “right now” because the country’s enrichment facilities had been “attacked.” The enrichment process produces fuel for nuclear power plants, which, at higher-enrichment levels, can also be used to make a nuclear bomb.\n \n\n   \n  Khatibzadeh did not comment on whether enrichment was taking place at Iran’s facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a confidential report Wednesday that checking Iran’s stock of highly enriched uranium was “long overdue,” with its inspectors still not allowed into the bombed nuclear sites, Reuters has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Khatibzadeh said Iran’s nuclear program was peaceful, repeating Tehran’s long-standing position that it exists solely for energy generation purposes.\n \n\n   \n  He also suggested that any future dialogue with the United States over Iran’s nuclear program would be contingent on an agreement that Iran could pursue uranium enrichment. “Delusions of zero enrichment inside Iran or trying to deprive Iran from its basic rights is not going to be an option for Iran,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Khatibzadeh said Iran has “legitimate military programs to defend our national interests and our national security.” Asked by CNN if Tehran is expanding its missile program, the minister said the program was going through “repair and recovery” after a US-brokered  ceasefire  between Israel and Iran came into effect in June.\n \n\n   \n  Last month,  CNN reported  on signs that Iran is stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the recent reintroduction of United Nations sanctions that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources said Chinese firms were helping Iran rebuild its ballistic missile program, with several shipments of sodium perchlorate – a missile propellant precursor – being delivered from China to Iran since the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  In his CNN interview, Khatibzadeh said Iran has “very close relations” with China, as well as Russia, which predate “anything that happened recently.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he had a message to the Trump administration regarding its relationship with Iran, the deputy minister said his country is the “oldest living, continuous civilization on earth… This country and this nation is (a) master of survival.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Melissa Bell and Gianluca Mezzofiore contributed to this report.

But it earned just $13 million this weekend, a worse-than-expected drop of 68% from its opening.\n \n\n   \n  The slate of movies in theaters this weekend is ultimately the “calm before the storm,” said Robbins, when Universal Pictures debuts “Wicked: For Good,” the sequel to last year’s highly acclaimed “Wicked,” which  opened  to $114 million.\n \n\n   \n  “Wicked: For Good” could rake in upwards of $140 million to as much as $180 million, according to Gross. That’s more than the combined success of “Wicked” and “Gladiator II” during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend last year, which combined to gross $169.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  Hollywood has seen sluggish box office sales this   fall, but industry analysts expect a rebound in the coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Disney’s “Zootopia 2” opens Thanksgiving weekend, which could end a “long drought” of animated movies that didn’t perform well at the box office,   Robbins said.\n \n\n   \n  And Universal Pictures is releasing “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” a sequel to the 2023 horror film based on the video game series.\n \n\n   \n  Other movies expected to see big audiences include “Avatar: Fire and Ice” (December 19), and “Marty Supreme,” “Anaconda” and “Song Sung Blue” on December 25.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna have a supercharged final six weeks of the year,” Dergarabedian said. “After a fairly slow post-Summer period, this is where we’re going to make up a lot of ground.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5554508","dateOfPublication":"2023-09-11","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"The Enduring Value of Cultural Traditions in a Changing World","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article discusses the enduring value of cultural traditions in contemporary society.

Today,  40% of all babies in the U.S.  are born to unmarried women,  a dramatic increase since 1960 , when they made up only 5% of births.  Increasingly, they are women over 30, like Rumley. This group has swelled in number by over 140% in the last three decades, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NPR spoke to over two dozen single mothers in this age group. Up and down the income spectrum, they paint a starkly different picture than the persistent  stereotypical image  of single mothers as  irresponsible  and incompetent. That's partly because in the 1980s and '90s, most of them were teenagers or in their early 20s. Today, that's less likely. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Women over 30 have more life experience under their belts and they're a lot more capable; they're more likely to  have full-time jobs ,  more education  and  earn more , all of which give them the power to choose. More importantly, they say, it has given them agency. \"I felt like I had a fire lit under me\" Danielle Townsend from Philadelphia, who is now 36 years old, remembers her 20s as a period of struggle after graduating from college. She was almost 30, working part time at Trader Joe's, when she found out she was pregnant. \"I felt like I had a fire lit under me. I was like, 'I have to figure my life out  yesterday ,'\" she says. Townsend was in love with the father of her child, an artist. But she says they disagreed on how to raise their child, and his temporary gigs didn't supply the stable income she felt their nascent family needed. \"He wasn't even willing to try to find a better job that had benefits,\" she says. Under that strain, their relationship fell apart. Townsend remembers being in survival mode after her son, Khalib, was born. She signed up for food benefits. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Determined to create a better life, she enrolled for a Master's degree in librarianship. Those days, she says, were a blur of studying, lugging Khalib between her own dad's home and her son's dad's for child care, and juggling part-time jobs — all in the middle of the pandemic. After graduating, she moved to Mississippi for a job, but being alone and far from home with a little child was hard. Even though she felt she was making the right decisions, she could feel \"this dark cloud moving in,\" she recalls, \"this heaviness.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Two years ago, she moved back to Philadelphia. She's now a librarian, a job she loves. Khalib, who just turned 7, is a budding environmentalist and wants to be a conservation scientist when he grows up.  His favorite thing to do is to go on \"trash walks\" with his mom, where they try to keep the city's parks and streets clean. They've even done that to celebrate his last birthday, when Townsend gifted him a trash picker with a claw to his utter delight. Today, Townsend dreams of buying a home. And she breathes a little easier. \"OK, Danielle,\" she tells herself. \"You're not really in survival mode anymore.\" Behind ﻿the new rise of single motherhood in America According to  Pew Research , the United States has the world's highest rate of children living in  single-parent households ; 23% compared to a worldwide average of 7%. One of the biggest reasons why more women have been choosing single motherhood is that they're financially better prepared to start families on their own.  The number of women entering the workforce  has skyrocketed in the last five decades. But those gains have come at a time when  men have been dropping out of the workforce . Today, more women than men are  enrolled in college , in  master's programs  and in  law  and  medical  schools. This disparity in work and education means that many women in their mid-30s are ready to start families, and support them, even if they haven't found male partners. IVF provides another path  Another imbalance is that compared to men, women's fertility declines faster with age. So unlike men, women who want children can feel their reproductive clock ticking louder in their 30s and 40s. Some women, like Susan Kufdakis, are choosing in vitro fertilization (IVF) to have babies on their own. Kufdakis, an attorney who works with Florida's Department of Children and Families, finished law school and passed the bar in her early 30s. But when she hadn't met a romantic partner by the time she turned 35, she froze her eggs as a backup plan. Then she turned 37 and could hear her biological clock ticking. Of Greek-Puerto Rican heritage, she'd dreamed of the perfect Greek Orthodox wedding, but she felt she needed to prioritize having a baby over waiting for that right person. \"I don't want to lower my standards just because I want a family,\" she says. So she chose IVF. The process is  invasive, expensive  and it can take several tries to conceive a baby. It wasn't easy on her, either. Her son, Yiannis, was born earlier this year after Kufdakis got pregnant on her second try. Each cycle cost her $38,000. She took on debt and, even though she wanted to live on her own, she currently lives with her parents, who help with child care. \"I don't think I could have done it without them,\" says Kufdakis, who is now 39. Single vs. married parents \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But not everyone has the option of moving in with their parents, and many  sociologists  and  economists  who study families say kids do better when there are two parents to raise them. Economist Melissa Kearney's book   The Two-Parent Privilege: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind  got a lot of attention from proponents of marriage when it was released two years ago. It argued that two married people together bring in more income and have more time to devote to their children. \"These resource advantages then set children up with more opportunities to get ahead in life,\" Kearney wrote in her book. It cited data that showed, compared to two-parent households, a third of children in single-parent households spend their lives in poverty, and many don't graduate from high school or go to college. But, Kearney's  research  has also showed that children of older moms have an advantage over younger ones. Kids born to unmarried mothers over 30 were almost three times more likely to have college degrees and earn higher incomes as adults, when compared to those raised by single moms who give birth in their early 20s or teens.  Much of the research was based on the world's longest-running  household survey , which followed 5,000 U.S. families with children born between 1960 and 1989 — when there were fewer single mothers in America, and they tended to be younger. That data, however, hasn't yet caught up with the current generation of children raised by older single moms. \"As single mothers are much less likely to be teen or young mothers as compared to previous generations of single mothers, they are increasingly likely to be able to provide financially for their children, especially when it comes to avoiding poverty,\" Kearney said recently via email. The American family Today's single moms still face structural disadvantages, including laws that provide overt legal or financial benefits to married couples. For instance, couples can save thousands of dollars by jointly filing taxes. They can also collect more Social Security. Those laws reflect a past centered on the institution of marriage and the nuclear family — a focus some political groups would like to bring back. The Trump administration is heavily influenced by  Project 2025 , a policy and staffing blueprint published by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. It starts with a promise to restore the family as the centerpiece of American life. Its first chapter opens with the argument that the American family is in crisis, partly because \"40% of all children are born to unmarried mothers\" and calls fatherlessness \"one of the principal sources of American poverty, crime, mental illness, teen suicide, substance abuse.\" Heritage Foundation research fellow Delano Squires points out that not only are people having fewer children, they're waiting longer to have them, marriage rates are declining and the number of children born to unmarried parents is increasing. \"Those are all troubling statistics,\" he says. To encourage marriage, Project 2025 recommends the use of government funding to provide a school curriculum on healthy relationships and sexual abstinence. \"You can't have strong communities without strong families,\" Squires says. \"You can't have strong families without strong, enduring marriages.\" But Jane Mattes, who in 1981 founded the support group  Single Mothers By Choice,  says that what's most important for children is having a loving, stable home — regardless of how many parents are in it. \"Being born into a marriage does not guarantee anything as far as your stability or your functioning,\" she says. Her group now counts 30,000 members, and she says that although she's observed that women in the group with lower incomes struggle more, \"Parenting is really the key, not your income.\" \"We're about to have one hell of a life together\" As for Rumley in Winchester, Va., she can't imagine her life without Lorelei: \"She is just fierce and wild and beautiful and caring, and my life would be so much darker without her in it.\" Rumley's own journey started out as a surprise pregnancy from a boyfriend she'd been dating for barely four months. When she told him about it, he offered to pay for an abortion. But she had always wanted to have a baby. And Rumley, at 35, felt she didn't have time to wait for a picture-perfect husband. She told him she was keeping her baby. He responded by hanging up on her and has been absent from their lives since. The years before that had been hard ones. Burned out during the pandemic, she had quit her job as an assistant at a veterinary clinic. Then she lost her apartment. She was working part time and living in a shed at the wildlife center that employed her. But the pregnancy changed the calculus of Rumley's life. She knew she needed a job with a steady income. She found work again as a vet's assistant. It got her health insurance, and $30,000 a year — which qualified her for food benefits. She swallowed her pride and moved in with her parents. It was hard, she says. \"I was afraid that I was just going to sit and waste away and I did not want to do that.\" And Rumley desperately wanted to chart a new course for her life. She started by naming her daughter Lorelei   after the iconic single mom of the 2000s show  Gilmore Girls . She went back to an old hobby, running. Soon she was running with Lorelei in the stroller, first a mile, then 5K and 10K. She recently moved up in her career, landing a new job as an assistant manager at a vet's clinic. She now earns $45,000, and she got her own apartment. She doesn't qualify for food benefits anymore. These days, Rumley is building a new community for herself and Lorelei. She joined a running club and is training for a marathon. She's made new friends at work and around town, other moms with whom she swaps playdates and babysitting duties in a pinch. She acknowledges that raising a child alone isn't easy. There isn't a second income to help pay the bills, or another pair of hands to pitch in with the housework. \"I have got her 100% every single day,\" she says of Lorelei. \"And there's very little wiggle room for that.\" She also worries about the questions that Lorelei will ask, or get from others, about her absent father. But more often than not, she's relieved that she gets to make all the decisions for the family. \"I kind of have more control of how Lorelei and I get to take this journey,\" she says. And on any given day, she often remembers the moment just after Lorelei was born, when they first locked eyes: \"That was the moment that I knew we were about to have one hell of a life together.\" If you are a single parent and would like to share your experience with NPR, please feel free to  fill out this form . \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Single motherhood in this country is changing. More mothers are over the age of 30, and many raise kids on their own because they chose that. NPR's Pallavi Gogoi set out to understand how single moms make it work. And she found some answers at 6 o'clock in the morning at a home in Winchester, Virginia. ADRIENNE RUMLEY: What would you like to eat? LORELEI: Banana. RUMLEY: Banana. Let's get a banana. PALLAVI GOGOI, BYLINE: It's still dark in Adrienne Rumley's two-bedroom apartment. She's been up for an hour already, had lots of coffee. And now it's time to get her daughter ready for day care. RUMLEY: May I see your toothbrush? Go, ah. LORELEI: Ah. (SOUNDBITE OF TOOTHBRUSH BRUSHING) RUMLEY: One, two. GOGOI: Two-year-old Lorelei is still sleepy. Her dark curls spill out from pigtails tied the previous day. It's 6:30 a.m., and there's a lot going on. Their frisky 4-month-old kitten darts around the apartment. Their big dog, Athena (ph), patters back and forth. There's another cat watching everything from behind an armchair. RUMLEY: Where are your socks and shoes? LORELEI: My socks and shoes right there. RUMLEY: Thanks. And thanks for finding them. GOGOI: The scene seems chaotic. But 37-year-old Adrienne Rumley's morning routine is working in clockwork precision. RUMLEY: Five minutes does not seem like it makes much of a difference. But there's a reason I leave at exactly 7:02. GOGOI: 7:02 a.m. It's how she avoids the school bus rush so she can drop off Lorelei and make it to her job on time. Rumley has structured her days in these precise nuggets. She has agency in almost everything she does. RUMLEY: I have chore charts. We all have our own duties as a family. And her chores are like, did we brush our teeth today? GOGOI: Rumley in her 30s is among the fastest growing group of single moms in America today. Yet this new reality isn't quite reflected in the narrative. RUMLEY: There's a ton, a ton of stigmatized things and a lot of misconceptions about single moms in general. GOGOI: Today's single moms are older. Compared to younger women, they tend to be more educated, have full-time jobs, earn more. They have more life experience. And all this gives confidence to women like Rumley. RUMLEY: This is not how I planned to be a mom. I kind of planned the whole picture-perfect husband and wife and house, let's plan a family. GOGOI: For her, it started with a boyfriend she'd been dating for barely four months. RUMLEY: Pregnancy test came back positive, so whoopsie-daisy. GOGOI: When she told him, he offered to pay for an abortion. RUMLEY: I said, oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't say I was getting an abortion. That's not what I wanted to do. GOGOI: So he hung up, blocked her and has been absent from their lives since. Rumley had always wanted to have a baby, and at 35, she felt that she didn't have that much time to wait for that picture-perfect husband or pursue other options to have a kid. Here was an opportunity to start her own family. She clearly remembers the day when Lorelei was born. RUMLEY: She locked eyes with me, and that was the moment that I knew we were about to have one hell of a life together. GOGOI: Rumley admits to being meek when she was younger, spending much of her 20s as a people pleaser. But the decision to have a baby in her mid-30s galvanized her. RUMLEY: Making sure I had a steady income, that's going to be the No. 1 thing when it comes to keeping a roof over our head, keeping food on the table. GOGOI: So she got a job as a vet's assistant. Her pay was $30,000 a year. Like many single mothers, her income was low, which qualified her for food benefits. At that time two years ago, Rumley swallowed her pride and moved in with her parents in North Carolina. But that wasn't where she saw herself. RUMLEY: I was afraid that I was just going to sit and waste away, and I did not want to do that. GOGOI: Rumley, who loves punk rock music and sci-fi fantasy novels, had to put aside some of those interests. But she reclaimed one of her old hobbies, running. LORELEI: My Lorelei. RUMLEY: Mommy has got my Lorelei? GOGOI: This time with Lorelei in the stroller. RUMLEY: It's time her and I are spending together. She just gets to watch the world as I run every single one of these miles. GOGOI: Rumley recently landed a new job in Winchester, Virginia, as an assistant manager at a vets clinic. She moved, got her own apartment. She got a pay raise. She now earns $45,000. But that doesn't solve everything. Raising a child alone isn't easy. RUMLEY: There is not that second person with you to maybe let you take a break if you just need five minutes to go take a shower to potentially earn a second income. GOGOI: It's no surprise that many sociologists and economists point to reams of studies which show that kids do better in households with two parents. Two parents with more time, money and resources set their children up for success. RUMLEY: Everyone says, well, two-parent households are better. You got to have a two-parent household. GOGOI: But the research is outdated and hasn't caught up with this new generation of children being raised by a growing number of older single moms. And Rumley pushes back. RUMLEY: Look at us. We're doing just fine. GOGOI: She says that maybe it's even easier getting to make all the decisions for the family. No arguments, no need for permissions from a second parent. RUMLEY: I kind of had more control of how Lorelei and I get to take this journey, so I was honestly a little relieved. GOGOI: And she isn't looking for a second parent even as she's slowly started dating. RUMLEY: It is not about, I want to find a dad for Lorelei. It's more of like, I deserve connection with someone, and I would like to try to go find that. GOGOI: Rumley consciously works on her community being her second set of hands. Her running club members help watch Lorelei when she runs a big race. A couple of her colleagues have children at the same day care, and they sometimes share babysitting in a pinch. Rumley says she has zero regrets. RUMLEY: She is just fierce and wild and beautiful and caring. And my life would be so much darker without her in it. GOGOI: And while she doesn't have the means to give herself big treats, she's constantly on the lookout for small moments that make her happy. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SHUTTING) GOGOI: So at 7:02 a.m., Rumley drives her kid to day care. RUMLEY: What if we listen to mommy music? LORELEI: I want my music. RUMLEY: You want Mickey Mouse? OK, we'll do Mickey Mouse. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"YOUR LIBRARY\") LUDWIG VON DRAKE: (Singing) If you need some answers, there's a way to find them by yourself. GOGOI: Lorelei comes first, of course. RUMLEY: See you later, baby. GOGOI: But after the drop-off, Adrienne Rumley gets back in the car. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOMETOWN\") TWENTY ONE PILOTS: (Singing) A shadow tilts its head at me. RUMLEY: So now we listen to mom music. GOGOI: Her workplace is literally right across the street. RUMLEY: And I purposely take a little longer drive to work so that I have a couple extra minutes to myself. GOGOI: That three minutes of \"Hometown\" by Twenty One Pilots is the me time she gives herself to power through her day. Pallavi Gogoi, NPR News, Winchester, Virginia. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOMETOWN\") TWENTY ONE PILOTS: (Singing) Be the one, be the one to take me home and show me the sun. I know, I know you can bring the fire. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/tech/internet-archive-wayback-machine","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:47:00-05:00","title":"Inside the old church where one trillion webpages are being saved","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Internet Archive, a non-profit digital library founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle, has preserved over one trillion webpages using its Wayback Machine.

where one trillion webpages are being saved \n       \n  By Hadas Gold, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:47 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Just blocks from the Presidio of San Francisco, the national park at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, stands a gleaming white building, its façade adorned with eight striking gothic columns.\n \n\n   \n  But what was once the home of a Christian Scientist church, is now the holy grail of Internet history — the Internet Archive, a non-profit library run by a group of software engineers and librarians, who for nearly 30 years have been saving the web one page at a time.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the stained-glass-adorned sanctuary, the sounds of church sermons have been replaced by the hum of servers, where the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine preserves web pages.\n \n\n   \n  The Wayback Machine, a tool used by millions every day, has proven critical for academics and journalists searching for historical information on what corporations, people and governments have published online in the past, long after their websites have been updated or changed.\n \n\n   \n  For many, the Wayback Machine is like a living history of the internet, and it just logged its trillionth page last month.\n \n\n   \n  Archiving the web is more important and more challenging than ever before. The White House in January ordered vast amounts of  government webpages to be taken down . Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is blurring the line between what’s real and what’s artificially generated — in some ways replacing the need to visit websites entirely. And more of the internet is now hidden behind paywalls or tucked in conversations with AI chatbots.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the Internet Archive’s job to figure out how to preserve it all.\n \n\n   \n  “We are here to try to provide a record of what happened, so that people can learn and build on that to build a better future, or to build new ideas that are worthy of being in the (Internet Archive’s) library,” said Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle.\n \n\n   \n    The internet’s library\n \n\n   \n  Kahle created the archive in 1996 when a year’s worth of saved pages could fit on about 2 terabytes worth of hard drives, the amount of storage you can get today in an iPhone. Now, the archive is saving closer to 150 terabytes, or hundreds of millions worth of web pages, per day.\n \n\n   \n  Kahle is the driving force and personality behind the archive, with the exuberance and energy of your favorite science teacher and like an evangelist whose religion is libraries and technology. Sitting for an interview on the original wooden pews of the church, Kahle said he was inspired to purchase the building because it resembles the group’s logo. But more importantly, he said it’s a symbol of permanence and a reference to the Library of Alexandria in Egypt.\n \n\n   \n  “That was the first time somebody tried to go and collect everything ever written by humans,” Kahle said. “Of course, now that place is the internet, and the Internet Archive serves the whole internet as a library.”\n \n\n   \n  The Wayback Machine tool does more than just screenshot the page. It also saves the technical architecture — the HTML, CSS, JavaScript codes and more — so that it can attempt to “replay the page as it existed” even if the server is no longer functioning, said Wayback Machine Director Mark Graham.\n \n\n   \n  The rise of artificial intelligence and AI chatbots means the Internet Archive is changing how it records the history of the internet. In addition to web pages, the Internet Archive now captures AI-generated content, like ChatGPT answers and those summaries that appear at the top of Google search results.\n \n\n   \n  The Internet Archive team, which is made up of librarians and software engineers, are experimenting with ways to preserve how people get their news from chatbots by coming up with hundreds of questions and prompts each day based on the news, and recording both the queries and outputs, Graham said.\n \n\n   \n  The group keeps copies of its archive in locations around the world in the event of a fire or flood that could damage its servers. But there are political considerations behind this approach, as well. The Trump administration has exerted pressure over content it disagrees with by filing  lawsuits against media companies  or by way of  the Federal Communications Commission.  \n \n\n   \n  “Libraries are always targeted. The new guys often don’t like the old stuff around. So let’s design for it,” Kahle said. “Let’s go and live up to the moment and make it so that there’s different points of view stored and made permanently accessible in different environments.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration implemented  a massive overhaul of government websites  that included taking down countless pages on everything from  health policies  to the achievements of minority members of the military. It was the archive, which has been saving webpages during the transition of presidential administration websites since 2004, which enabled journalists to understand what had been altered.\n \n\n   \n  “This change was huge. Whole sections of the web came down,” Kahle said. “(The administration) has a new point of view, and that’s why we have libraries to go and have the record.”\n \n\n   \n    The people preserving the web\n \n\n   \n  Most of the archive’s servers live in a large warehouse outside of San Francisco, although a set of servers have been symbolically placed in the main sanctuary of the former church. That placement is intentional, said Kahle.

Gloria Beltran announced at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  Police identified the suspect as 27-year-old Cedric Irving, Beltran said. The suspect was acquainted with Beam but did not have a close relationship with him, according to Oakland Assistant Chief of Police James Beere.\n \n\n   \n  For many, the news felt unthinkable.\n \n\n   \n  Piedmont Police Chief Frederick Shavies described Beam as a “father figure to thousands of not only men but young women,” someone who left an “indelible” imprint on Oakland and far beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds gathered for a vigil Thursday night, holding candles and hope as Beam fought for his life — the same way he had spent decades teaching young people to fight for their own, Shavies said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hearts are aching,” Shavies said, reflecting on the man he had known since eighth grade — the man who stepped in with support after Shavies’ father died.\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s family said in a statement read by police: “We are devastated that John — our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, coach, mentor and friend — has passed. Our hearts are full from the outpouring of love and support from all who cared about him. We are deeply grateful for your continued prayers and ask for privacy during this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, questions remain about what authorities described as a “very targeted incident,” as the suspect awaits formal charges. The case will be referred to the district attorney’s office for review.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about the suspect\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday at 11:53 a.m., Oakland Police officers responded to Laney College and found Beam suffering from gunshot wounds, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  Beam had been at the college’s fieldhouse, which houses the athletic training facilities, where he continued serving as athletic director after retiring as head football coach last year. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and listed in critical condition.\n \n\n   \n  Officials obtained photos of the suspect, who was later spotted at the San Leandro Bay Area Rapid Transit station. He was taken into custody and gave a statement to police regarding the shooting, Beltran said.\n \n\n   \n  “The ability to actually track the suspect after he left Laney College was a diligent effort and an amazing, heavy lift to go through hundreds of hours of surveillance footage so we could track that individual,” Beere, Oakland’s assistant chief of police, said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect played football at Skyline High School in Oakland, but not while Beam was employed there, authorities said. Although Irving was not a student at Laney College, he was often seen loitering on campus, Beere added.\n \n\n   \n  “Coach Beam, although (he and the suspect) did not have a close relationship, was open to helping everybody in our community, and this is not uncommon for him to have a relationship with someone that he would think needs help,” Beere said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said Irving was on campus for a specific purpose, though they did not specify what that was. While authorities described the encounter as targeted, Beere confirmed it was not connected to a robbery.\n \n\n   \n  Irving is scheduled to appear in court for his arraignment Tuesday morning at a courthouse in Oakland, according to online records for the inmate.\n \n\n   \n    A champion for second chances\n \n\n   \n  Beam’s impact on the game stretched across more than four decades. He began coaching in Oakland in 1982 as Skyline High School’s defensive coordinator before joining Laney College in 2004 as the running backs coach, later becoming offensive coordinator and eventually head coach in 2012. Under his leadership, Laney won two league titles.\n \n\n   \n  His influence reached far beyond the sidelines. More than 20 of Beam’s former players went on to the NFL, including seven who played in the Super Bowl, according to his  biography on the college’s website. \n \n\n   \n  His appearance in the 2020 season of “Last Chance U” introduced his tough-love mentorship style to a national audience and cemented his status as a champion for young athletes seeking a second chance.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Netflix for comment.\n \n\n   \n  To the Bay Area, Beam was more than a coach. He was a builder of people, a steady presence, a believer in potential.\n \n\n   \n  Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee reflected on the profound impact Beam had on the community, calling his legacy one “we all have to lift up, given the way he mentored young people, people who never would have had a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Beam coached the mayor’s nephew when he attended Skyline High School, she said, calling Beam “a phenomenal human being.” His influence transcended the football field, she added; he was a mentor, a friend, and a source of guidance for students, athletes and community members from all walks of life.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor described the city’s grief, noting the outpouring of support from people across Oakland as the community struggles with the loss.\n \n\n   \n  “He was friends with everyone and encouraged everyone. He never thought anyone was a lost cause,” Lee told CNN on Friday. “People feel the void already and are grieving this loss like you would not believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Athletes across the country took to social media to mourn Beam, sharing photos and memories that capture the stunning impact he had on their lives. Chicago Bears cornerback Nahshon Wright  posted a group photo with Beam , writing simply, “Will forever miss you dawg.” New Orleans Saints cornerback Rejzohn Wright shared a  heartfelt homage,  captioning a cheerful photo of a trio posing with Beam, “Crushed.”\n \n\n   \n  “I pray my prayers strong enough,” Wright wrote over a memorial video montage of Beam guiding and inspiring his athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Both athletes shared a video from April 2023, taken days before the NFL draft, showing Beam at football practice. Wearing his signature sunglasses and mustache, he jokes with the players while offering guidance — a fleeting, tender glimpse of the warmth, humor, and care that made him much more than a coach.\n \n\n   \n  Closing his remarks during the news conference, Shavies said, “I know that if Coach were here, he’d finish by saying, ‘Two claps — ready, ready.’”\n \n\n   \n    Another life ‘stolen’ by gun violence\n \n\n   \n  Laney College was  placed on lockdown  Thursday after reports of a shooting, as police secured the area and launched an investigation. The campus reopened Friday with mental health and counseling services available, the college said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Peralta community is devastated by his shooting,” Chancellor Tammeil Gilkerson said in a message to employees. “We are stunned and heartbroken that such violence has touched our campus and one of the most respected and beloved members of our Laney, Peralta, and Oakland community.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilkerson described Beam as “a renowned coach, teacher, mentor, and leader whose impact extends far beyond athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier statement, Lee condemned the killing, saying gun violence has “stolen” another life and warning that the city cannot allow firearms to continue flooding its streets and destroying the very people “who are trying to save our community.”\n \n\n   \n  “Coach’s Beam’s legacy isn’t measured in championships or statistics,” Lee said in the statement Friday. “It’s measured in the thousands of young people he believed in, mentored, and refused to abandon … He gave Oakland’s youth their best chance, and he never stopped fighting for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident is Oakland’s second school shooting in two days.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, one juvenile was shot and two were arrested at Skyline High School,  police said . The juvenile who was shot was taken to the hospital and was in stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “It is devastating,” Lee added. “Schools should be the safest spaces in our city. We need guns off our streets now.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/science/star-giant-explosion-cme","dateOfPublication":"1000-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:38:00-05:00","title":"First Detection of a Coronal Mass Ejection from a Star Beyond Our Solar System","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Astronomers have made the first confirmed detection of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from a star beyond our solar system — originating from the red dwarf star StKM 1-1262, located 130 light-years away.

In our solar system, this phenomenon is a large cloud of ionized gas, called plasma, and magnetic fields that erupts from the sun’s outer atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  When such outbursts are large enough to reach Earth, they can cause space weather, or major disturbances of our planet’s magnetic field. These powerful solar storms create auroras at Earth’s poles but can also disrupt communications, the power grid and satellite operations.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers have never been able to detect a coronal mass ejection releasing from another star — until now. Researchers described the groundbreaking finding in a study published Wednesday in the  journal Nature .\n \n\n   \n  The star, named StKM 1-1262, is a red dwarf star about 130 light-years from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  The stellar storm launched at a blazing 5.3 million miles per hour (2,400 kilometers per second). Such speed has only been clocked in about 1 in every 2,000 coronal mass ejections released from our sun, according to the study authors.\n \n\n   \n  “The star behaves like an extremely magnetized, boiling bucket of plasma. This burst is 10 to 100 thousand times more powerful than the strongest the sun can produce,” study coauthor Cyril Tasse, research associate at the Paris Observatory, said via email. “This opens a window of extrasolar space weather.”\n \n\n   \n  The dense, rapid burst of material hurled from the star was powerful enough that it could strip away the atmosphere of a closely orbiting planet.\n \n\n   \n  Understanding how the violent activity of stars affects exoplanets is crucial as astronomers seek to determine whether any planet beyond our solar system is potentially habitable for life.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking stellar explosions\n \n\n   \n  Once released into space by a star, coronal mass ejections create a burst of radio waves while passing through the outer stellar atmosphere, called the corona.\n \n\n   \n  “They are strong gusts of stellar wind that move faster than the speed of sound in the surrounding interplanetary space, creating a shock wave that is comparable to the sonic boom of a fighter jet,” said Mark Miesch, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Miesch did not participate in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers spotted the radio signal while using new analytic software to sift through a survey of the sky that was conducted by the Low Frequency Array radio telescope, or LOFAR, nearly 10 years ago. LOFAR is composed of thousands of antennae in the Netherlands and across Europe to create one large radio telescope.\n \n\n   \n  “This kind of radio signal just wouldn’t exist unless material had completely left the star’s bubble of powerful magnetism,” said lead study author Dr. Joe Callingham, associate professor at the University of Amsterdam’s Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy. “In other words, it’s caused by a CME.”\n \n\n   \n  Tasse and study coauthor Philippe Zarka, a senior researcher at the Paris Observatory, developed the new analysis technique, called Radio Interferometric Multiplexed Spectroscopy, or RIMS. It was based on wavelengths of light captured from thousands of stars to monitor them and determine how they changed over time, Tasse said.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea was to try to detect radio signals from stars and exoplanets,” Tasse said. “This is an ideal technique for CMEs that evolve on timescales of minutes so you need continuous, high-time-resolution monitoring.”\n \n\n   \n  The signal detected by RIMS was a type II radio burst, suggesting hot gas was sweeping away from the star into space. Unlike  fast radio bursts , which are millisecond-long flashes of light with dubious origins, a type II radio burst occurs over minutes, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  “The sweep encodes the density of material as the CME travels outwards,” Callingham said. “So not only from the radio burst can we tell mass has been lost from the star, we can also determine physical parameters like density.”\n \n\n   \n  The team used data from the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton mission, launched in 1999, to measure the star’s temperature, rotation and brightness through X-rays.\n \n\n   \n  “We needed the sensitivity and frequency of LOFAR to detect the radio waves,” said study coauthor David Konijn, a doctoral student at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, in a statement. “And without XMM-Newton, we wouldn’t have been able to determine the CME’s motion or put it in a solar context, both crucial for proving what we’d found. Neither telescope alone would have been enough — we needed both.”\n \n\n   \n  Spotting coronal mass ejections releasing from other stars has proven difficult because they’re just too far away to observe the phenomenon directly, Callingham said. While previous hints of coronal mass ejections from other stars have surfaced, they could often be explained by other activity such as strong flares, and there were no definitive detections, Tasse added.\n \n\n   \n  “Previous evidence for CMEs in other stars has mainly been concerned with the early stages of the event, when the plasma first lifts off from the star,” Miesch said.\n \n\n   \n  But using a sensitive telescope like LOFAR and searching for the telltale radio signal enabled a direct discovery, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  Miesch said the emission signature matches the known signatures of type II radio bursts from solar CMEs.\n \n\n   \n  The clear detection of a type II stellar radio burst has long been sought after as an indicator of coronal mass ejections from other stars, said Kevin France, associate professor and astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder. France has studied coronal mass ejections but did not participate in this research.\n \n\n   \n  “This detection provides what is likely the strongest evidence yet that this phenomenon occurs beyond the solar system,” he wrote in an email. “This observation, and hopefully more like it, will allow us to better understand the violent early lives of these low mass stars that make up over 70% of all the stars in our Milky Way.”\n \n\n   \n    The search for life\n \n\n   \n  Red dwarf stars can have magnetic fields that are more than 1,000 times stronger than that of our sun, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  StKM 1-1262 has half the mass of our star, but it rotates 20 times faster and boasts a magnetic field that is estimated to be 300 times more powerful, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists often find exoplanets orbiting these stars that are much fainter, cooler and smaller than our sun, and at a closer distance than planets in our solar system — sometimes completing one orbit in a matter of days.\n \n\n   \n  Because red dwarf stars are less luminous and cooler than our star, the habitable zone — the distance from a star where conditions on the planet are warm enough to potentially support liquid water on its surface — is much smaller, meaning planets are more tightly clustered around the diminutive stars.\n \n\n   \n  But astronomers have long questioned whether flares released from red dwarf stars could lash planets with harmful radiation. If a planet does have liquid water on its surface, which means it could potentially be habitable for life, then it also has a protective atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  Currently, it isn’t known whether any planets orbit StKM 1-1262, but based on previous research, almost every red dwarf star seems to host at least one planet, Callingham said.\n \n\n   \n  “The protective magnetic field we have on Earth would not be able to withstand the pressure of the CME, exposing its atmosphere directly to CME (causing it to be stripped),” Callingham wrote in an email. “So even if the planet is in the perfect region around the star, its atmosphere would be lost quickly, leaving a barren rock behind (kind of like Mars).”\n \n\n   \n  Next, the researchers want to try and determine how such small stars build and release such enormous energy, Tasse said — and figure out what impact repeated coronal mass ejections could have on nearby planets.\n \n\n   \n  Callingham is also the head of the Square Kilometre Array Science Group at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.\n \n\n   \n  The Square Kilometre Array, expected to be completed in 2028, will include thousands of dishes and up to 1 million low-frequency antennae to create the world’s largest radio telescope, which could search for coronal mass ejections releasing from other stars.\n \n\n   \n  “This is only the beginning, and hopefully a taste of what’s to come,” Miesch said. “Hopefully this will inspire follow-up studies to verify this is what we think it is and to further characterize how frequent such events are.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609166","dateOfPublication":"2023-09-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:45Z","title":"California Court Ruling Sets Precedent on Legal Ethics and Client Confidentiality","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent court decision in California has reignited discussions around legal ethics, particularly concerning client confidentiality and communication transparency.

Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba, sees a connection between her character's trajectory and her own.  \"There were so many sort of real parallels — the relationship with her father, the relationship to being in spaces that don't really include you,\" Erivo says. \"The feelings you see in the movie are very real feelings.\" Erivo grew up in London as the child of Nigerian immigrants. From an early age, it was evident that she had a powerful singing voice. She attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but felt like an outsider. \"It was a tough experience to be there. I just didn't think I fit,\" she says. \"And I think there was sort of a lack of wanting to understand where I was coming from or who I was as a person.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Erivo first broke through on Broadway in  The   Color Purple ,  winning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Celie. She went on to earn an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of  Harriet Tubman , and later played  Aretha Franklin  in   Genius Aretha .  In  Wicked: For Good , Erivo reprises her role as Elphaba, alongside  Ariana Grande  as Glinda, in this final chapter of the  Wicked  story. Both  Wicked  movies were filmed at the same time, which proved challenging at times. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There were days where, luckily, you would sort of know where the character was at this point [in the story],\" Erivo says. \"But there were some times where you're sort of guessing really, because you hadn't shot a certain scene, you're just sort of assuming that the scene is gonna feel this way.\" Erivo also has a new memoir,  Simply More: A Book for Anyone who Has Been Told They're Too Much , which details her childhood in South London and her path to the stage. Interview highlights On her physical training for  Wicked I'd [swim] laps, then sing and then I'd run. ... It's the idea that if I'm doing something that's strenuous and I can sing it whilst I'm doing the thing that's strenuous, when I'm standing still, it'll just be there. I won't actually have to work that hard for it to be there. ... Once your body has it in it, it just sort of lives with you. And so that's what I wanted for myself. On getting into character through perfume \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I started doing this years and years ago. The first time I did it, I think I did with Harriet [Tubman] and hers was, like, cedarwood and lavender, I think it was, but like essence with a base oil, not a perfume, because I wanted it to feel like something she could find, that she could discover, make, as opposed to something you could just buy in a store and spray on oneself. Because of the time, because of who she was, I wanted it to feel like it was of the Earth. And then I realized how powerful it was for me. And so I kept doing it with my characters. ... \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So Elphaba, who's younger, I sort of messed around with big florals, like really deep florals. So tuberose, rose, lilies and then I mixed it with a tobacco oud. It was a scent called Witchy Woo. When I found it, I thought, there's no way this is going to work. It will be way too on the nose. … I was staying at a Soho Farmhouse in the UK and they have this little sort of gift shop and in the back they have a few perfumes … I sprayed some on my hand and immediately I wasn't convinced, but you know how perfume changes? … My body is like, no, this is a really good scent. There was a reason it was there for you, go back for it. On her decision to cut, and then shave, her hair It started a long time ago, just as I was coming out of drama school. I just knew that I wanted something different. Around that time, everyone who was auditioning, girls who were auditioning wanted long hair and a particular kind of aesthetic, and I sort of repelled against the idea because I didn't want any distractions. I don't know what gave me the idea, what gave [me] the wherewithal to think, I want to lessen the distraction. I want them to just see my face. I want, when I walk in, for them to see a canvas that can transform. A vessel. That what you see is really me, and I can change into the character in front of your very eyes. After I left drama school, I cut my hair. I went to get a haircut and the hairdresser was very, very scared to cut it, because my hair was quite long. It came down past my shoulders. … If you're African, often you cut your hair if you lose someone. So there's an understanding of loss. You know that the old adage when a woman cuts her hair or changes her hairstyle, a life shift has happened. That is very true of the Nigerian tradition. And so, for me, I felt like I went for my own life shift. ... It was sort of leaving [drama school] behind and taking from it what I needed and letting go of whatever else I didn't. And when I cut my hair, I felt strangely like myself. I've felt like I've been steadily moving towards cutting it off completely, and  Wicked  was the moment when I took it off completely. On regretting a time she sang backstage, allowing another actor to lip-sync to her voice \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's one of those moments that I've started to learn to forgive myself for because ... previously I've felt so mad at myself. So I guess there's a part of me that's a little bit ashamed that I would sort of give up my voice in that way. But it's also why I'm vehemently protective of the way I use my voice. I do not say yes to everything at all. It has to mean something for me to sing, and it has to make sense. I will never give my voice to someone like that again, because it felt like someone removing a gift that was meant for me and giving it to someone else. It just felt, in the moment, really awful, and I remember feeling really wrong. It felt wrong. On not growing up with her father, and not having a relationship with him as an adult I think I'm in a real place of acceptance, and a strange apathy as well. I don't wish him harm, but it's not like I'm waiting for some grand resolution. I'm sort of OK with it being exactly what it is. I have no desire to start a relationship. I have no desire to mend a relationship. But it doesn't really occupy my thoughts. If the point of doing the things you love or the point of doing a thing that you're good at is to make someone care about you, is to prove that you are meant to be loved, is to prove that you are worthy of being loved, it doesn't sustain. Because really and truly, the most important love is that of yourself. It has to come from you first. Ann Marie Baldonado and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

There's a moment in the new movie \"Wicked: For Good\" when Elphaba, the so-called wicked witch, stops defending herself to a world that has misunderstood her and simply exists on her own power. My guest today, Cynthia Erivo, brings that moment to life with a depth that is also personal. In part two of \"Wicked,\" Erivo captures Elphaba's evolution from outcast to someone who claims her own story, a journey Erivo also explores in her new memoir \"Simply More.\" The book traces how she learned to shed other people's definitions of her as a woman, as a Black artist and as someone who was sometimes told she was too much. Erivo first broke through on Broadway in \"The Color Purple,\" winning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Celie. She went on to earn an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman and later portrayed Aretha Franklin in \"Genius: Aretha,\" for which she was nominated for several awards, including an Emmy. Erivo is also a recording artist, blending gospel, soul and cinematic pop. Last year's \"Wicked\" and the new film \"Wicked: For Good\" are adapted from the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical. The new film continues Elphaba and Glenda's story, exploring what happens after their fates diverge and the myth of the Wicked Witch takes hold. And, Cynthia Erivo, welcome back to FRESH AIR. CYNTHIA ERIVO: Hello. Thank you very much. MOSLEY: You know, there is something extraordinary about watching \"Wicked\" and then \"Wicked: For Good\"... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...And reading your memoir at the same time. There are so many parallels there. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: When did it click for you that your personal life and that connection to Elphaba were so close? ERIVO: I think I had an inkling that there was a connection soon after I started doing the music, singing the music, learning the music. But I think it really actually clicked when I was making the film, when I was playing the character, that I realized, oh, this is a lot closer to home than I had imagined. But I didn't realize that there were so many sort of real parallels - the relationship with her father, the relationship to being in spaces that don't really include you. All of that sort of dawned on me as it was happening. So the feelings you see in the movie are very real feelings because they're sort of immediate. Yeah. MOSLEY: Was there a particular moment during that time period where it hit you - you said, wait a minute, this is me? ERIVO: We were shooting - and this is going to sound so strange because it's such a small moment, but we were shooting the scene when Nessarose is about to be sent off to school, and their father asks Elphaba to take care of Nessa. And I remember he speaks to her quite harshly, and the feeling that I got in that moment sort of was a click moment for me. It was that moment that I realized, oh, this relationship is a complicated one. That's when I sort of thought, oh, I recognize that. MOSLEY: What's so interesting about that is that the story of \"Wicked\" had been living with you for years. ERIVO: Years. Years. MOSLEY: I mean, we're talking over a decade... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...Or so. ERIVO: The first time I discovered it was when I was 20 or 21. Yeah. MOSLEY: Director Jon Chu actually asked you during the audition... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...What does Elphaba mean to you? ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: And you told him the story of \"Defying Gravity,\" which was a song that you had learned several years before... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...When you were in school. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: You write about this in your memoir, \"Simply More.\" And I want you to read exactly what you said to Jon. Can I have you read it? ERIVO: (Reading) This was the exact piece of music I escaped into when I was in drama school. If I was having a really bad day or was miserably aware of how odd I felt there, an outsider who couldn't connect with the others, I would hide out in a music room with a friend, Michael (ph). We'd sing this together. We'd stay in that little room until the very last minute before we had to go back to class, belting our hearts out. This song gave me refuge. Singing it during a very vulnerable time in my life, these songs made me feel safe. MOSLEY: That was also the first time that you shared out loud how alienating... ERIVO: I felt. MOSLEY: ...School was for you. ERIVO: Very much so, yeah. MOSLEY: Yeah. What was it about that moment that it came to you to actually be vulnerable and tell - and also, that was a show of the connection between... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...You and Elphaba as well. ERIVO: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I felt really safe in that room. I felt like Jon would understand it. And I also knew that in order to really connect with this character, to really help people understand that I knew and understood who this character was, who this person was, that I had to be vulnerable, that I had to share the experience that I felt that this character had been through. And I felt like this character needed the vulnerability that I can sometimes be afraid of sharing or being. I'm better at it now. But in that moment, I just thought, if I'm not honest about what I feel or have felt or how this music has made me feel, then I think I'm leaving something on the table that is important. MOSLEY: That experience that you had at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, that was a very difficult time for you, maybe one of the most difficult times... ERIVO: It was. MOSLEY: ...In your entire career. ERIVO: Yeah. Yeah. I just felt like people really didn't understand me and at the same time, whilst not understanding, didn't really make very much room for me, either. It was sort of once a judgment was made, that judgment stayed. I think I was lucky enough to have one or two people during that time, who really looked out for me, who cared for me, but it was a tough experience to be there 'cause I really - I just didn't think I fit, and lots of strange, interesting microaggressions from people who now are not at the school. But it was an interesting, tough time. MOSLEY: What were they telling you about yourself, or how did you think they perceived you? ERIVO: I think they thought I was unfocused and troublesome. I think they thought I didn't care about my work. A lot of people - there was - sometimes - well, there's one person in particular who made a comment about my body. It was too muscular. I needed to stop going to the gym. And at that point, I just was like, well, I like the body I'm in. And so to have someone who was teaching, who was supposed to be, you know, mentoring me, say that was just - it was just horrifying. MOSLEY: You were a young girl. You had grown up in South London. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: You had to work. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...Your way through school. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: And that was part of the issue. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Was that you, unlike other students, had other jobs. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: You were working as a background singer. ERIVO: Background singer, in a bar, at a theater. MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: I was working at a shirt and tie shop, as well, over the weekend. And so I was like - I was working a lot. And that happened because when I first got there, I was given the opportunity to go and do backing vocals for a band that would have paid for my tuition in its entirety. And when I asked if I could take the time off, which was two weeks, I was given an ultimatum, either to stay and let the gig go or leave and take the gig, but I couldn't come back. MOSLEY: What an impossible position to be in. ERIVO: Yeah. And I didn't want to leave, so... MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: I stayed. MOSLEY: During your time there, you were given these bit roles. But there's this moment that you write about where you were asked to sing for another singer who had laryngitis. But you weren't asked to be on stage. ERIVO: No. It was backstage. MOSLEY: Backstage. And then they would lip-synch to you. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: And you did it. ERIVO: Yeah. It's one of those moments that I've started to learn to forgive myself for because I felt so - previously, I felt so mad at myself. So I guess there's a part of me that's a little bit ashamed that I would sort of give up my voice in that way. But it's also why I'm vehemently protective of the way I use my voice. I do not say yes to everything at all. It takes a lot for me. It has to mean something for me to sing, and it has to make sense. I will never give my voice to someone like that again because it felt like someone removing a gift that was meant for me and giving it to someone else. And it just felt, in the moment, really awful. And I remember feeling really wrong. It felt wrong. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. Our guest today is Grammy and Emmy Award-winning actor Cynthia Erivo. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WICKED ORCHESTRA AND WICKED MOVIE CAST'S \"DEFYING GRAVITY (SING-ALONG)\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR, and today we're talking to Cynthia Erivo, the award-winning actress and singer who stars as Elphaba in the \"Wicked\" films. She's also the author of a new memoir, \"Simply More: A Book For Anyone Who Has Been Told They're Too Much.\" I want to play a clip from the latest installment of \"Wicked,\" because we learned that The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a fraud. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: But in this film, you're standing up to Oz, who is oppressing the animals. And I want to play this clip to illustrate this. It's you as Elphaba, Ariana Grande as Glinda and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz played by Jeff Goldblum. And he's telling you why efforts are meaningless. ERIVO: Right. MOSLEY: Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"WICKED: FOR GOOD\") JEFF GOLDBLUM: (As The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) Elphaba, oh, I've missed you. Can't we start again? ARIANA GRANDE: (As Glinda) Yes. Please, just say yes. ERIVO: (As Elphaba) No. Don't you think I wish I could? I would give anything to go back to a time when I actually believed that you were wonderful, the wonderful wizard of Oz. No one believed in you more than I did. But there's no going back. And we can't move forward, not until everyone knows what I know. And once they know the truth... GOLDBLUM: (As The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) They're not going to believe it. ERIVO: (As Elphaba) How can you say that? GOLDBLUM: (As The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) Oh, I'm just being straight with you. I could tell them that I've been lying to them till I'm, forgive me, blue in the face. But it wouldn't make any difference. They're never going to stop believing in me. You know why? Because they don't want to. MOSLEY: That's my guest today, Cynthia Erivo, in scene with Jeff Goldblum and Ariana Grande in \"Wicked: For Good.\" You all shot this back-to-back. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good,\" right? ERIVO: Not back-to-back. At the same time. MOSLEY: At the same time? ERIVO: Simultaneously, yeah. MOSLEY: Did you have to hold anything back emotionally as you were moving through these two different storylines that one kind of evolves from the other? ERIVO: Yeah, it was really interesting because sometimes - I think we had shot quite a bit of the first movie, but not nearly enough to say we'd almost finished. No way. We were nowhere near. And then we were sort of all the way into the second. And we were sort of tandeming between the two movies. So there were days where luckily, you would sort of know where the character was at this point. And you'd have some sort of hindsight for where they had come from and what they had been through in order to move into the second movie. But there were some times where you're sort of guessing really. MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: Because you hadn't shot a certain scene. You're just sort of assuming that the scene is going to feel this way. MOSLEY: How did you navigate that? Did you just surrender to the idea? ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: You have to, you have to. And also, I think both of us actually, Ari and I, both of us sort of made really specific decisions about how we looked, what we walked in, the clothes we were wearing, even the scents that we were wearing, because I always find a scent for each character that I play. MOSLEY: What do you mean by scent? ERIVO: Perfume. I always find a scent for each person. But this time, I found a scent for each Elphaba. So Elphaba who's young wore a very different scent to Elphaba who's older. And so scent memory was a lot to do with how to sort of click back into where we are in time. MOSLEY: Oh, this is so interesting. ERIVO: Yeah (laughter). MOSLEY: Can you slow down for a moment? ERIVO: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. MOSLEY: First off, how did you come to that idea, and what scents did you choose? ERIVO: I started doing this years and years ago. The first time I did it, I think I did it with \"Harriet.\" And hers was like cedarwood and lavender, I think it was. But like essence, with a base oil, not a perfume because I wanted it to feel like something she could find, that she could, you know, discover, make. I wanted it to feel like it was of the earth. And then I realized how powerful it was for me, and so I kept doing it with my characters. So with Elphaba, I knew that they had to feel different. So Elphaba who's younger, I sort of messed around with, like, big florals, like, really deep florals. So tuberose, rose, lilies. And then I mixed it with, like, a tobacco oud. And sometimes I find a scent and it's not right. And I go back and I go - it's a real - something will say, this is the one. MOSLEY: Oh, this is so fascinating. So for Elphaba \"For Good,\" what was her scent? ERIVO: Hers, you'll never believe me, but it was a scent called witchy woo. MOSLEY: Oh. ERIVO: Which when I found it, I thought, there's no way this is going to work. It will be way too on the nose. MOSLEY: Where did you find it? ERIVO: I was staying at Soho Farmhouse in the U.K. And they have this little sort of gift shop. And in the back, they have a few perfumes. And I saw this scent. It said witchy woo. And I thought, I'm not I'm not going to like this. I'm not going to like it. It's too on the nose. There's no way. So I sprayed some on my hand, and immediately, I wasn't convinced. But you know how perfume changes? Your... MOSLEY: Your body, your scent. ERIVO: Your body, your scent, your own... MOSLEY: Natural oils and stuff. ERIVO: ...And Natural oils change the scent. So I go away, and I keep going back to it. My body is like, no, this is a really good scent. There was a reason it was there for you. Go back for it. MOSLEY: (Laughter). ERIVO: So I go back for this scent. So I'm wearing witchy woo and I'm wearing, in this time, like, a grown oud. MOSLEY: And this helped you keep your mind around the different emotional notes between the two... ERIVO: Yes, that's right. MOSLEY: ...Movies. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: Do you think that has something to do with because you have... ERIVO: Synesthesia, yeah. MOSLEY: Synesthesia. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: Which means you can see color when you sing. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: The music. ERIVO: Right, the music. MOSLEY: Do you feel like this might be connected? ERIVO: I'm sure. I think my senses are heightened, so I know I have a heightened sense of smell, and obviously, with music, there's a heightened sense there. So I think maybe, but I've never thought of it that way. I've always thought of it as just another access point to each of the characters. It's just sort of the characters' way of telling me another bit about who they are, you know, what calls to them, what is part of their DNA. And that is another thing that I think just I've sort of discovered along the way 'cause it isn't the same ever. I've never worn the same thing for any character. MOSLEY: There's some pretty intense training that goes... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...Into this role, both physical, emotional. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: I mean, when you were even training to audition... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Is it true that you would try to sing while you were swimming? ERIVO: Yes. I would sing and sort of - I'd do laps and sing, and then I'd run, and then I would sing. I just wanted it to be in my body. You know, it's the idea that if I'm doing something that's strenuous and I can sing it whilst I'm doing the thing that's strenuous, when I'm standing still, it'll just be there. I won't actually have to work that hard for it to be there. MOSLEY: Let's talk a little bit about where you grew up. You grew up in South London. ERIVO: South London. MOSLEY: Stockwell. ERIVO: Stockwell. MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: You grew up with your mom and your younger sister. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: Are their voices like yours? ERIVO: As in singing and speaking? MOSLEY: Yes. ERIVO: My sister can really sing. She'll hate me for saying it out loud. But I think she has a beautiful singing voice. My mom, I think my acting ability came from my mum, but she loves to sing, and she loves music. MOSLEY: Was there a lot of music in your home? ERIVO: All the time. All the time. MOSLEY: Were you guys singing together? ERIVO: Yeah. Me and my sister would harmonize together. My mom would sing in the car, and we would sing along. Christmas morning is really, really fun because it starts at, like, 6:00 a.m. in the morning and then just goes till the middle of the night. MOSLEY: When did you know that your voice could make people feel? ERIVO: I had an inkling that something was happening with my voice at about 5 because I was asked to sing \"Silent Night\" at - for a nativity. I think it was because I was just not shy that they asked me to sing it. I don't know that they knew I could sing, or maybe they did, but I had no idea. I was just happy to sing the song because of people's reaction. I knew that it made people happy. I know that much. You can - you know, it's basic. You see people smiling, people clap, people stand. They're happy. And I connected it with that. But I think it was when I was maybe about 12 when people kept asking me to sing. Like, I was on the school playground, and it would be lunchtime, and other kids would say, hey, can you sing? Can you sing this? MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: Then I would sing it, and they would get their other friends and they'd go, Cynthia's going to sing, you know, and then talent shows started coming up, and they would ask if I would sing. And that's when I knew that something - that I could do something with my voice. I think when I really understood that it could make people feel, I want to say it was about 18. I sang at a place called Troy Bar (ph) which is like an open mic little - it's like a little restaurant that had an open mic night every Tuesday or Thursday. And I, one day, decided to get up and sing, and you could hear a pin drop. MOSLEY: Do you remember what you sang? ERIVO: I sang \"Say Yes\" by a band called Floetry. MOSLEY: Oh, of course. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: Would you sing a little bit? Is that asking too much? ERIVO: No, no. (Singing) Loving you has taken time. Taken time. But I always knew you would be mine. I recognize the butterflies inside me. Oh, sense is going to be made tonight, tonight. All you got to do say yes. All you got to do is say yes. Don't deny what you feel. Let me undress you baby. Open up your mind. Just rest. I'm about to let you know. You make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so. You make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so. MOSLEY: Was it a cappella like that? ERIVO: It started that way, and then the pianist, I remember his name was Oscar, played for me. And every time I went back to that place, he would just start the song. (LAUGHTER) ERIVO: He'd just start the song. So I didn't ever have a choice. He'd always just - sing this. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, I'm talking with Cynthia Erivo. She stars as Elphaba in \"Wicked: For Good,\" and she's written a new memoir called \"Simply More.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WICKED MOVIE CAST & THE WICKED ORCHESTRA'S \"POPULAR (SING-ALONG)\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley, and we're continuing our conversation with Cynthia Erivo. She's a Tony, Grammy and Emmy Award winner who's been nominated for an Academy Award twice, first for playing Harriet Tubman in \"Harriet\" and most recently for her role as Elphaba in \"Wicked,\" which became the highest grossing movie based on a Broadway musical in domestic box office history. She's also portrayed Aretha Franklin in the National Geographic series \"Genius: Aretha\" and Celie in the Broadway revival of \"The Color Purple.\" Her new memoir, \"Simply More,\" is about embracing ambition and refusing to be diminished. You didn't grow up with your dad. You don't know much about your dad. ERIVO: No. And, like, I know him. I've met him. My mom gave us the space and the choice to grow our relationship. She gave him a choice to grow the relationship, but he never really took the opportunity. MOSLEY: Can I have you read a section from the book... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Where you talk about him? It's actually a poem. ERIVO: Yes. (Reading) Fun facts about my father. I don't know how old he is. I don't know his birthday. I don't know his profession. I don't know his parents' names. I don't know where he lives. I don't have his phone number. Suffice it to say, I really don't know much about him at all. I was 16 when he left me alone in a London underground station after an argument about a transit pass, when he told me he didn't want to be in our lives anymore. I stood there in shock. My head was empty. And then I walked away. The first step felt like running into a brick wall - pain, then agony. My emotions opened like floodgates. I cried so hard, I could barely breathe, could barely see. It was only when I ended up on the wrong train platform that I realized that I had been walking in the wrong direction. Just as I made my way to the right platform, there he was. He was in front of me, walking straight in my direction. I held my breath. Maybe he was going to apologize. Maybe this argument would just disappear. Before my cascading scenarios could solidify into hope, he passed right beside me. He made no eye contact, said nothing. I was nothing. From that moment forward, to him, I had ceased to exist. It was the last day I ever spoke with him. I do not know much about my father, but I do know a few things, his name, that he can whistle, that he always wore a leather bomber jacket. We both have a gap between our two front teeth. And by some strange stroke of irony and because God likes playing jokes, my father can sing. MOSLEY: Oh, Cynthia. First off, thank you for reading that. Have you heard your father's voice? ERIVO: Yes. It's a good voice. He's got a lovely voice. I learned to whistle from him, which is why all of those things are so strange because we have so many similarities. MOSLEY: You wrote in a very matter-of-fact way. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: Was it easy for you to write that? ERIVO: It was easy to write that now. I think if you'd have asked me to write it, I don't know, 10 years ago, it would've been really difficult. But I think, I don't know, I'm in a real, like, place of acceptance, I think. And a strange apathy as well. MOSLEY: Can you describe that apathy? ERIVO: Yeah, I don't wish him harm. But, you know, it's not like I'm waiting for some grand resolution. I'm sort of OK with it being exactly what it is. I have no desire to start a relationship. I have no desire to mend a relationship. It doesn't really occupy my thoughts that much. MOSLEY: But it took time to get to that point. ERIVO: Yes. Yes, it did. MOSLEY: Because there was a time where you wanted to be able to show him. ERIVO: Yes, of course. MOSLEY: I am Cynthia Erivo. I am... ERIVO: Yeah, you're going to miss this. MOSLEY: You're going to miss this. ERIVO: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it doesn't sustain. If the point of doing the things you love, or the point of doing a thing that you're good at is to make someone care about you, is to prove that you are meant to be loved, is to prove that you are worthy of being loved, it doesn't sustain. Because really and truly, the most important love is that of yourself. It has to come from you first. And it was a great driver. That sort of wanting to prove was really fantastic for a time. It was really great. MOSLEY: Was there a particular moment in your career where maybe you got a role or you played a piece of music and you thought, my dad's going to hear this or see this? ERIVO: I think maybe up until the \"Harriet\" of it all. I think that's when I thought, oh, maybe he'll see it and think, I messed up, maybe I'll contact. And I think it was when I had that thought that I thought, I don't know that this is the healthiest thing for me. I think that's actually when I started therapy, just because it doesn't work. And it's so much more joyful when it's not for that. MOSLEY: Yeah. I'm not going to spoil it, but there is a storyline thread in \"Wicked: For Good\" where Elphaba's father is very prominent. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: Did you ever have a moment while you were filming that where you were thinking about your own experience? ERIVO: Oh, I think most of the way through it, to be honest. I think the time when it really sort of all came to a head is in the first movie, where we're in that sort of - we call it the Ozdust Ballroom. That solo dance moment that turns into a duet, that's when it all sort of comes to a head. So when you see those tears falling out of my eyes, that was not rehearsed. That was not planned. It just happened, yeah. MOSLEY: That's how therapeutic that can be for you... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...To actually act it out. ERIVO: Yeah. Yeah, and I wasn't planning for it to be. But as long as you're open to it, that can happen, that these moments can really help to move through some things that you maybe didn't know were there to move through. Or that the things that you've been through can come to the surface and you can use them to connect to the moment. MOSLEY: Yeah. Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, I'm talking with Cynthia Erivo. She stars as Elphaba in \"Wicked: For Good.\" And she's written a new memoir called \"Simply More.\" This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WICKED ORCHESTRA AND WICKED MOVIE CAST'S \"WHAT IS THIS FEELING? (SING-ALONG)\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today we're talking to Cynthia Erivo about her new memoir, \"Simply More,\" and her role in the film \"Wicked: For Good.\" Erivo won a Tony for her role in \"The Color Purple,\" and she received an Emmy nomination for portraying Aretha Franklin and an Oscar nomination for playing Harriet Tubman in the film \"Harriet.\" Did you know about Harriet Tubman growing up in Britain? ERIVO: I did. I did, but we just didn't get enough information on her. It's like a small little... MOSLEY: Yeah? ERIVO: ...Thing in the textbook that takes up maybe one page if we're lucky, if we're lucky. But when you do further excavation of who they are, when you learn more, you realize just how full a life she led. MOSLEY: How did you decide - because we don't have - you were able to dig through the research... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...That is available. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: But you had to create a person... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Out of what is, like, just a black and white photograph and all of these little bits of information. ERIVO: Yeah. I was lucky because when I was playing her, an image had just been unsurfaced of her as a 20-something-year-old. And it was totally different to the picture that we... MOSLEY: Right, that was new. ERIVO: That was new. MOSLEY: Because we had only had her as an older woman. ERIVO: We only - as an older woman. And so that sort of struck questions for me. I was lucky 'cause my director, Kasi Lemmons, and the writer, Greg, had sort of helped guide me through the major moments in her life that we never have spoken about. And they're there. It's there. Yes, we know that Harriet Tubman was a hero and saved many people and freed many slaves, including herself. What we didn't know is that when she was doing it, she was 27. She was a young woman. She was also broken-hearted. She had left her love behind. She went back to get him, and he was with someone else. We don't know that. Why would she continue after that heartbreak? Well, because she couldn't rest. The reason she continued is because she didn't feel like she actually had obtained freedom until other people were free. She didn't feel like she had obtained freedom until she could share it with her family. Also, she was not well. She would black out. MOSLEY: She had, like, a narcolepsy or... ERIVO: She had - I actually think she might have had epilepsy. But those episodes would bring visions. I learned that she sang. She was a general. She led a woman's suffrage movement at a time when really no one wanted any suffrage for Black women specifically - all after she had had her run through the Underground Railroad. That sort of was done by the time she was 30 something, which we sort of think of as what was happening until she was... MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: ...In her older age. But actually, by the time she was 45, she was a general. MOSLEY: These women you also play, I mean, they're also so purpose driven... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...In a way that - like, I also feel this way about Aretha. ERIVO: She was. MOSLEY: Yes. ERIVO: She was. MOSLEY: Were there any surprises you learned about Aretha? ERIVO: She kept trying again and again and again; that at the very beginning, she wanted to sort of go in the same route as, like, the jazz greats, and it didn't work for her. And it was sort of, what about the Ellas and the... MOSLEY: The Dinah Washingtons, yup. ERIVO: ...Dinah Washingtons - and it just didn't make sense for the voice that she had, also for the history of music that she had. But she was trying so hard to fit herself into a lane that wasn't made for her because, essentially, the lane that was made for her was made by her. But there was never an inkling of her going - like, giving up. I never felt like that was an option for her. The option was, OK, this doesn't work. Well, now what? What else works? MOSLEY: Yeah. ERIVO: That, for me, was, like, a real - like even when I think about it now, I was like, that's the feeling I get from her. And that actually - something about the transformation that happens with her and music, I think, is a real spiritual one. I think she would disappear into music almost like she was in a trance and then come back again when she was done. MOSLEY: Was there any self-consciousness for you, because you used your real voice... ERIVO: I did, yeah. MOSLEY: ...In the series, to take on Aretha's music... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...And embody her in that... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Way with your voice? ERIVO: Yeah. I was curious about the things that she could do. I realized that there was - the skill that this woman had is, I mean, tantamount to no - there was no other person like her. There's no other - there's no other voice like hers. There was no other person who sings like her. Because what she was able to do with her voice is unlike anyone else's that I've ever heard. MOSLEY: I want to play you singing from \"Aretha.\" Let's listen. ERIVO: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CHAIN OF FOOLS\") ERIVO: (As Aretha Franklin, singing) Chain, chain, chain - chain of fools. Every chain has got a weak link. I might be weak, yeah, but I'll give you strength. You told me to leave you alone. My father said, come on home. My doctor said, take it easy. Oh, but your lovin' is much too strong. I'm added to your chain, chain, chain. Chain, chain, chain. MOSLEY: Aretha was notoriously private. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: And also, like, I think the funniest thing to do is to watch Aretha Franklin... ERIVO: In the interviews. MOSLEY: In the interview. ERIVO: Oh. It was my favorite thing to do. It was my favorite thing to do. It was my favorite because she's so brilliant. She's so good. She's so good at keeping everything to herself and still giving you something. MOSLEY: The point that I want to get to, though, with you, is that, like, I wonder what you walked away with with that. Because for the longest time, you know, I think we as fans, we want from those who give us inspiration through their art. We want to know everything. We want to know the source of it. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: She was very much like, this is what I'm going to share... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...And this is it... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...Even when it came down to the story about her life. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: And so for you as someone who has played her... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...And those notes, some of them not really good... ERIVO: No MOSLEY: ...Especially about her childhood... ERIVO: Yeah, yeah. MOSLEY: ...What did you walk away with in thinking about what you tell and what you don't tell and what rights people have to it? ERIVO: That it's all very important. That what you decide to keep for yourself is OK. That there is sort of a want from others to know everything. But your life, all of your life isn't for everyone's consumption. Each person walking through the world, no one knows everything about that person, no one, not even the closest people to you. There are things that you get to keep for yourself because they're just yours. And I think the wonderful thing about Aretha not sharing absolutely everything about her life is that we got to know her as the artist, that we inevitably have to respect the work. And sometimes that should be enough. Sometimes that's enough because that's what she wanted to give. And I think we sometimes yearn for more from artists. And actually, the artist's job is to create art. And we should be OK with letting them do just that, you know? MOSLEY: Is that a lesson that you had to come to yourself? ERIVO: Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm more of an open book than Aretha. But I'm also OK with keeping some things for myself. And also, I think I love the way artists and actors and stars and celebrities of old would keep some things for themselves. MOSLEY: It's harder to now, right? ERIVO: Yeah. But it is harder, too, because the temptation is to share everything because there's so much access to ways to share everything. But there is a choice. You can choose to share some and keep some. And I think that it's OK. Because if you share everything, there's nothing left. I think a little mystery is OK, you know? I think it's OK for some people to guess a couple things and maybe get it right and maybe not, you know, because then there's something left. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, I'm talking with Cynthia Erivo. She stars as Elphaba in \"Wicked: For Good.\" And she's written a new memoir called \"Simply More.\" More after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CYNTHIA ERIVO AND ARIANA GRANDE SONG, \"WHAT IS THIS FEELING\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, we're talking to Cynthia Erivo about her new memoir, \"Simply More,\" her role in \"Wicked: For Good\" and the conversations about representation and accountability that have shaped her career. Something that you made the decision many years ago is to shave your hair. And talk about that decision because it also is something that sort of has changed the audition process for you. ERIVO: Yeah. It started a long time ago. Just as I was coming out of drama school, I don't know, I just knew that I wanted something different. Around that time, everyone who was auditioning, girls who were auditioning, wanted long hair and a particular kind of aesthetic. And I sort of repelled against the idea because I didn't want any distractions. I don't know what gave me the idea, what gave me the wherewithal to think I want to lessen the distraction. I want them to just see my face. I want when I walk in for them to see a canvas that can transform. MOSLEY: A blank canvas. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: A vessel. ERIVO: A vessel. That what you see is really me, and I can change into the character in front of your very eyes. And so what I would do is after I left drama school, I cut my hair. I went to get a haircut. And the hairdresser was very, very scared to cut it because my hair was quite long. It came down past my shoulders. MOSLEY: Also, you're Black, Cynthia. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: And you know our hair means so much to us. ERIVO: I know, yeah, it means so much. It does. It meant a lot to my mom. My mom was very surprised. I don't think I even told her before I cut my hair. And when I came back, she was really very surprised and sort of, you cut your hair? What's going on? Also, traditionally, when we cut our hair, one, it's for heat if you're African. And often you cut your hair if you lose someone. So there's an understanding of sort of loss. You know the old adage when a woman cuts her hair or changes her hairstyle, a life shift has happened? That is very true of the Nigerian tradition. And so for me, I felt like I went through my own life shift. I sort of thought, having had it happen right after drama school, it felt like it was sort of leaving something behind and taking from it what I needed and letting go of whatever else I didn't. And when I cut my hair, I felt strangely like myself. And the more I have - I felt like I've been steadily moving towards cutting it off completely. And \"Wicked\" was the moment when I took it off completely. I realized that my scalp had to be green. So when you watch \"Wicked,\" you'll see that the braids - it's 360. MOSLEY: Yes. ERIVO: So you can see my... MOSLEY: In between the braids, you can see a green scalp. ERIVO: You can see a green scalp. That is my scalp. It is not the wig. MOSLEY: Oh. ERIVO: It's not the lace of the wig. MOSLEY: Oh. ERIVO: The lace of the wig is basically translucent. And you can see my scalp underneath the wig, but we spray my scalp green. The way my face is green, it's included in my hair. And because I knew that was going to happen, I thought, well, I guess we'll have to just cut it all off. MOSLEY: This has been transformative, because of course... ERIVO: Very much so. MOSLEY: ...You wanted to go in as a vessel. But it seemed like those who were casting... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Had a visceral reaction to it. ERIVO: Yeah. So when I went in, I had very short hair. And that was when it was short and blonde, strangely enough, when I went to audition. And by the time I had gotten to the role itself, it'd grown a little bit more. And then I cut it. And I think everyone was very surprised that I was going to cut my hair because I think they were going to just make the lace dark underneath it and let it be like that. And I was like, well, why? If we're going to do it, we should do it. And also, when I cut it off, I really liked what I saw. So I just went with it, and I thought, there's just one - it's one extra thing that moves me closer to connecting completely with this person so that I'm not fooling myself about what I'm seeing in the mirror. I was asked if I wanted to be painted green or if I wanted it to be CGI, and I said, I want the full thing. I want to be painted green. But that includes my scalp. MOSLEY: That's got to be a long process, too. ERIVO: Yes. It is, at minimum, 2 hours and 45 minutes if it's just my face and neck and hands. MOSLEY: Every single time. ERIVO: Every single time. MOSLEY: You know, the \"Defying Gravity\" riff, it's now just become a cultural... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Phenomenon. ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: There's that moment where Kiki Palmer is at the... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...NAACP awards and she just starts singing it... ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...You know? What's it like to have your voice become a reference? You know, it's part of the cultural... ERIVO: Yeah, yeah. MOSLEY: ...Language now. ERIVO: I'm, one, deeply flattered, and it's kind of wonderful because many women have had their riff, and they've done it before, and, of course, you have the original by Idina Menzel. But it's just lovely to be part of the lexicon of that now. It's lovely. Yeah. MOSLEY: What colors do you see when you sing \"Defying Gravity?\" ERIVO: Blues, strangely. Different blue - like, iridescent blues. MOSLEY: Yeah. Ariana Grande sat in the seat where you're sitting... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...For the first \"Wicked.\" ERIVO: Yeah. MOSLEY: And she told me that the two of you all made a pact with each other... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...To help protect each other... ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: ...As you move through. ERIVO: Yes. MOSLEY: What was that pact? ERIVO: That. That we would make sure that we were always speaking to one another and that it would sort of be between us first if there was a problem, if something was not right, contracts, the whole lot. MOSLEY: How did you know that you had an ally in Ariana? ERIVO: You just feel it. You know, the first time we spent time together was probably on my floor, and we sat for, like, 5 hours just chatting. And I kind of just knew. You just know, you know? It was easy to talk to her. It was easy to get really real with her. If there was something I was struggling with or something she was struggling with, we would just sort of, like, find a corner to just chat immediately. We came up with, like, little safe words for each other. If there's - like, if there's something going on or I'm, like, overwhelmed for something, I have a word that I say, and if there's something she's overwhelmed with, she has a word that she says, you know, so that we know where the other one is. Yeah. And we really, like, we talk. We have real conversations. MOSLEY: Is that rare for a colleague? For a co-star? ERIVO: I think the myth is that it is. Is it rare for it to be this close? I think so. Is it rare completely? I don't think so. I think that we are led to believe that women cannot get along, and women cannot coexist within film and take care of one another. But I think that the continuation of that myth is the thing that makes it true. But actually, more often than not, all we have is each other. MOSLEY: Cynthia Erivo, this has been such a pleasure to talk with you. ERIVO: You too. This was wonderful. MOSLEY: Cynthia Erivo's memoir is titled \"Simply More.\" She stars in the new film \"Wicked: For Good,\" which is out in theaters on Friday.

November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “Do you really think, Mr. Netanyahu, that you can rename wars, hand out medals, tell tales of your heroism  –  and still avoid investigating the greatest national failure in Israel’s history?”\n \n\n   \n  Eyal Eshel’s voice cracked with rage as he stood on stage in Tel Aviv Saturday night and read aloud to thousands of protestors the cabinet’s recent decision to rename the  Gaza war  from “Operation Swords of Iron” to the “War of Redemption.” Then he tore it to shreds.\n \n\n   \n  “Forget it,” Eshel, whose daughter Roni was killed as an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) observer at Nahal Oz on October 7, continued. “We, the bereaved families, the residents of the Gaza envelope, the citizens of Israel  –  we will not let you. Until you investigate, there will be no revival. My Roni will not return, but the truth still can.”\n \n\n   \n  The scene captured one of the central battles now unfolding in Israel. The long war in Gaza has drawn to a close, but the domestic confrontation over accountability has barely begun.\n \n\n   \n  More than two years after the  deadliest day in Israel’s history , the government has yet to establish an official state commission of inquiry to investigate the security and intelligence failures that enabled Hamas to kill over 1,200 Israelis and kidnap more than 250 others.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, on Sunday, the government decided to move forward with establishing an “independent” commission of inquiry into the events of October 7, which will have “full investigative powers, and its composition will reflect the broadest possible public consensus.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the decision, Netanyahu will appoint a ministerial committee to present within 45 days its recommendation on the commission’s mandate. Instead of a state commission of inquiry, it’s a further delay.\n \n\n   \n  After the decision, the October Council - a coalition of bereaved families and survivors - condemned what it called the “political commission” and announced further demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  During the war,  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  repeatedly argued that an inquiry must wait until the fighting ended. Now that it is, bereaved families, survivors, and residents from the devastated Gaza border communities are intensifying their demand for a state commission of inquiry that will give them answers.\n \n\n   \n  A state commission of inquiry is the most powerful mechanism in Israeli law  –  empowered to investigate national-level disasters and decisions independent from the government of the day.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu, is pushing an alternative mechanism that would allow him to maintain control over who investigates and who bears responsibility, which critics say is designed to protect him rather than uncover the truth.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s rally was the first time the October Council   organized a mass protest, in an attempt to mobilize public support.\n \n\n   \n  “On October 7, more than 1,200 men, women and children were murdered or fell in battle. Babies were slaughtered in their cribs. Entire families were wiped out before our eyes. This was not just an attack – it was a small Holocaust in the heart of the State of Israel,” Rafi Ben Shitrit, whose son Elroi was killed in battle at the Nahal Oz post told the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of this pain  –  from the ashes  –  we must demand the one thing that should have been obvious,” he continued. “A full, independent state commission of inquiry to examine every process, every failure, every act of neglect, every silence. Without uncovering the full truth, there can be no repair.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet Netanyahu has adamantly resisted calls for such a commission because its members would be appointed by the Chief Justice of Israel’s Supreme Court, an institution his government has spent the past three years undermining.\n \n\n   \n  He has transformed his government’s clash with Israel’s judiciary, which predates the Gaza war, into a shield against calls for accountability, arguing there is low public trust in a state inquiry commission because it falls under the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Netanyahu reiterated in the Knesset that any future commission will not be, under any circumstances, a state commission of inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  During a debate initiated by 40 opposition parliamentarians, he claimed that “a large part of the public has no faith in a state commission of inquiry. We will promote a committee that represents all parts of the nation. The opposition shouts ‘state commission,’ yet they know that half of Israel would not accept its composition or conclusions. We seek a balanced committee that will investigate everyone and enjoy broad public trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Members of the October Council attending the session turned their backs in protest.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Netanyahu’s repeated claims that most Israelis oppose a state commission  –  and his campaign against it  –  repeated opinion surveys suggest the opposite. A poll by the Institute for National Security Studies in late October found that nearly three-quarters of Israelis (74%) support establishing a state commission, compared to just 17% who oppose it. Even among coalition voters, a majority (52%) back the move, while support among opposition voters reaches 92%.\n \n\n   \n  But public opinion hasn’t nudged Netanyahu’s government. Under pressure from petitions by bereaved families to the High Court, the cabinet has held repeated debates on the matter  –  but stopped short of any commitment. A discussion scheduled for Sunday is unlikely to break that pattern.\n \n\n   \n  Since the war ended, however, Netanyahu has stepped up efforts to establish a more limited alternative.\n \n\n   \n  One model is a government committee whose members he could appoint; another is a parliamentary committee divided equally between coalition and opposition representatives which would likely lead quickly to deadlock and paralysis. Neither would enjoy the independence of a state commission.\n \n\n   \n  According to two Israeli sources, Netanyahu seeks to prevent a future government from determining who investigates and who bears blame by establishing his own inquiry before elections that are due next year. What the October council families are demanding  –  a body capable of uncovering the full truth  –  is precisely what Netanyahu’s alternatives are designed to avoid.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the IDF has completed internal probes and the state comptroller’s office is conducting a broad investigation that tries to fill the void by extending beyond its usual remit. But without subpoena powers or a public mandate, their reports fall short from naming those responsible or recommending dismissals.\n \n\n   \n  For families who lost loved ones on October 7, technical reviews are no substitute for a national reckoning.\n \n\n   \n  “Every institution is investigating itself,” said Hila Abir, whose brother Lotan was murdered at the Nova music festival. “That’s not accountability. We need a real, independent commission that publishes findings and brings change - so that we never wake up to another October 7.”\n \n\n   \n  “We wake up every morning still not feeling safe,” Abir added. “That should worry every Israeli.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5610501","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"02:50:00-05:00","title":"President Trump Wants Seth Meyers Fired.

Turkey, typically the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal, will be one of the biggest sticker shocks for consumers. Wholesale prices for a turkey have jumped 40% from a year ago, according to the  Department of Agriculture . Outbreaks of avian influenza, or bird flu, and increased demand have contributed to these higher prices. Those opting for beef instead of turkey should also prepare to pay more. Beef prices are nearly 15% higher than they were last year, according to  data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Canned vegetables are  5% more expensive  compared to last year, due to higher packaging costs from the steel and aluminum tariffs the Trump administration put in place earlier this year. President Trump announced Friday that he would be  rolling back tariffs  he imposed on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities, in an effort to combat high prices at grocery stores. David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, said those   rollbacks won't lower prices completely, as tariffs aren't the only cause of increasing prices. \"By removing the tariffs, what we're doing is we're slowing down the increase in the price of many of these goods,\" Ortega said. \"So while we may not see prices go down for the holidays, it helps in terms of moderating the price increases that we've been accustomed to at the grocery store.\" Some grocery items have seen some price decreases in time for the holiday season. Egg prices have seen a decline from earlier this year, and domestic wine prices are  down about 1.2%  from last year due to a steady supply and softening demand. Ortega says buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits or vegetables is one way consumers can avoid higher prices from aluminum packaging. He also recommends shoppers plan their meals out in advance, look for private label or store brands over name brands, and shop early for certain items to take advantage of sales or promotions grocery stores might have. \"It really pays off to plan ahead and create a shopping list, making sure you're sticking to it and avoiding impulse purchases,\" Ortega said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/venezuela-epstein-trump-hegseth-branding-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"On Epstein and Venezuela, Trump tries to rebrand","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is engaged in a widespread campaign of political rebranding to reshape public perception across multiple domains. It rebrands military operations—such as renaming the Venezuela campaign 'Operation Southern Spear' and launching 'Operation Dirtbag' to target sex offenders in immigration enforcement—as a strategic effort to portray policies as more effective and legitimate. The administration also labels investigations into Epstein-related emails as a 'hoax,' echoing its earlier use of the 'Russia Hoax' narrative to discredit political scrutiny.

Wolf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In need of a reset on multiple policy fronts, the Trump administration isn’t afraid of turning to some good old-fashioned rebranding.\n \n\n   \n  ►  Tired of hearing about how Epstein emails released by a House Democrats feature President Donald Trump?\n \n\n   \n  Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate any Democrats who, like Trump, were Epstein associates and are mentioned in the emails. As the House moves toward a  bipartisan demand  for the FBI to release its Epstein files, Trump is trying to flip the script on what he’s now calling the “ Epstein Hoax. ”\n \n\n   \n  ►  Need a reset for the unpopular military policy in the Western hemisphere?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave the operation a new name, “ Southern Spear .”\n \n\n   \n  ► Hoping to make people believe a militaristic deportation strategy is focused on dangerous criminals instead of the preschool teachers and parents who have featured in recent news stories?\n \n\n   \n  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled “ Operation Dirtbag ,” in which ICE announces the deportation of previously convicted sex offenders, among mothers, in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  That Noem announcement came the same week a judge in Illinois ordered hundreds of detainees rounded up in ICE’s “ Operation Midway Blitz ” to be released.\n \n\n   \n    Trying to make the people believe on affordability\n \n\n   \n  On affordability —  Trump’s most obvious political problem  at the moment — he is working hard to reframe his policies around that term to argue that they will drive costs down. In fact, tariffs are likely to drive costs up, and tax cuts passed by Republicans will predominantly  benefit the wealthiest  Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But it is the new name for Trump’s Venezuela policy that has the most obvious feel of a complete relaunch.\n \n\n   \n  Though it has not gotten authorization from Congress, the Pentagon has overseen the apparently extrajudicial killings of  80 alleged drug traffickers  in the Caribbean and Pacific — and counting.\n \n\n   \n  The administration says it is protecting Americans from “narco-terrorists,” although it’s not clear the strikes will do much to stop the flow of drugs into the country, and it is deeply unpopular —  less than a third  of Americans said they supported it in a Reuters poll released this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear the strategy has changed, but Hegseth gave the strategy a new name this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,” Hegseth said on X from his official “Secretary of War” account.\n \n\n   \n    To military watchers, Southern Spear sounds like more of the same\n \n\n   \n  It seems like “a rebranding of an operation that started back in January of 2025,” military analyst retired Maj. Mike Lyons said Friday on “CNN This Morning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think the Navy thought they wrapped it up during the summertime,” Lyons added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that Pentagon briefers went further, laying out military options to Trump for US military action inside Venezuela. Trump on Friday suggested he has  made up his mind  on a path forward in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican and Air Force veteran, has said presidents should make the argument for why military action was in American interests and, when necessary, get authorization from lawmakers, as the Constitution requires.\n \n\n   \n  None of that has happened yet regarding Venezuela or the targeting of suspected drug boats, Bacon told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “I implore the president and his team, make your case to the American people, when you’re using our military and you’re going to pursue hostilities there has to be support from the people, and you need to get support from Congress,” Bacon said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump could look to the legacy of President George H.W. Bush, who launched the popular  Operation Desert Storm  to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion in the early ‘90s.\n \n\n   \n  Bush also launched Operation Just Cause in 1989 to arrest and depose Gen. Manual Noriega in Panama. That operation may have played well for him in the US and led to the capture of Noreiga, but Panama today marks its anniversary with a  national day of mourning  for the hundreds of civilians who were killed.\n \n\n   \n    Call it a hoax\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s strategies for bending public perception are well-documented. He almost never says “Democrats” without also adding “radical left,” for instance.\n \n\n   \n  His go-to method for defusing a controversy and reframe something in the public’s mind is to call it a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  A serious investigation by a special counsel into contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russians during the 2016 election has years later, by force of his constant repetition, been turned into the “ Russia Hoax .”\n \n\n   \n  Now he’s doing the same thing by trying to turn calls to release the Epstein files into the “Epstein Hoax.”\n \n\n   \n    On policy that touches people’s lives, rebranding is difficult\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers took Trump’s cue and officially named the massive tax and spending cut law they passed as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” That’s its name in US law.\n \n\n   \n  “That was good for getting it approved, but it’s not good for explaining to people what it’s all about,” Trump said back in August. He has yet to come up with something better, but he may be more focused today on trying to convince Americans he is addressing the affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  He claims prices have fallen, but Americans  aren’t experiencing that  in their daily lives.\n \n\n   \n    Is the MAGA brand bigger than Trump?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also struggled recently to control his own most famous catchphrase, MAGA, or “make America great again.”\n \n\n   \n  It is his brand, but he was at odds with other MAGA adherents on the subject of immigration.\n \n\n   \n  In a sometimes-contentious interview with the  Fox News personality Laura Ingraham,  Trump defended the idea of visas for  skilled immigrants.  He said the US did not have enough workers for certain jobs, which did not sit well with Ingraham. She argued that MAGA believers think the US has plenty of talent.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea,” Trump shot back. “I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.”\n \n\n   \n  But he may be losing a little bit of control over the MAGA brand.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611103","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:20:00-05:00","title":"CPB agrees to revive a $36 million deal with NPR killed after Trump's pressure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) agreed to reinstate a $36 million contract with National Public Radio (NPR) after withdrawing it under pressure from the Trump White House, which had previously threatened to cut off federal funding to NPR and PBS.

after Trump's pressure \n         By David Folkenflik \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 8:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed Monday to fulfill a $36 million, multi-year contract with NPR that it had yanked after pressure from the Trump White House. The arrangement resolves litigation filed by NPR accusing the corporation of illegally yielding to Trump's demands that the network be financially punished for its news coverage. The argument, part of a broader lawsuit by NPR and several stations against the Trump administration, focused on CPB funding for NPR's operation of a satellite distribution system for local public radio stations. NPR announced Monday it would waive all fees for the stations associated with the satellite service.  The judge in the case had explicitly told CPB's legal team he did not find its defense credible. CPB lawyers had argued that the decision to award the contract to a new consortium of public media institutions was driven by a desire to foster digital innovations more swiftly.  \"The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,\" Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR,  said in a statement . \"While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. We look forward to our day in court in December.\" In its submission Monday evening to the court, CPB did not concede that it had acted wrongfully — nor that it had yielded to political pressure from the administration. Instead, in  a statement posted on its website , CPB asserted its side \"prevails\" as a result of the settlement.  \"This is an important moment for public media,\" said Patricia Harrison, President and CEO of CPB. \"We are very pleased that this costly and unnecessary litigation is over, and that our investment in the future through [Public Media Infrastructure] marks an exciting new era for public media.\" CPB had awarded a rival contract to PMI, a newly created consortium of public radio organizations including several major stations, to ensure the digital distribution system functions properly. That contract will continue, CPB said. Federal subsidies for public broadcasting stopped on Oct. 1 as a result of a party-line  vote over the summer by Congress , called a rescission. Only a  skeleton crew remains at CPB , which was created as a nonprofit corporation more than a half-century ago to funnel federal subsidies to public media. While PBS has had layoffs and NPR is monitoring its own finances, many local stations across the country have been hit hard. Over the course of the litigation this fall, mounting evidence appeared to demonstrate that CPB's board chair and executives had acted against NPR in what turned out to be a futile attempt to salvage the corporation's own future. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In hearings last month in Washington, D.C., U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss told CPB's legal team they had  not made a credible case  for why the corporation reneged on the contract just a day after a top White House official warned senior CPB leaders against doing business with NPR. A trial had been set to start on Dec. 1. CPB's change of mind — and NPR's ensuing lawsuit — sparked consternation and unease within the larger public media ecosystem. The two organizations had served as partners for decades. But that relationship frayed earlier this year, as the system came under attack from the Trump administration. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's public campaign against NPR and PBS started in earnest soon after he returned to the White House. Trump kicked it into high gear in late March with a series of social media posts. In early April, CPB leaders sought to get money out the door before Trump took action against public media. On April 2, CPB's board approved the extension of a contract with NPR to distribute public radio programs, including those not produced by NPR. The arrangement stretched back four decades. The amount included millions still due on the then-current contract. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The next day, CPB's board chair and two senior executives met with a top White House budget official who attested to her \"intense dislike for NPR.\" The budget official told them CPB didn't have to \" throw the baby out with the bathwater ,\" according to a deposition from CPB executive Clayton Barsoum submitted as part of NPR's legal filings. And the day after that — just 48 hours after that board vote — CPB reversed itself. CPB executive Kathy Merritt informed NPR's top official over the satellite and distribution service that it had to be spun off: it could not be part of NPR. NPR refused to do so. CPB revised the scope of the contract and solicited new bids.   NPR's submission proved unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the White House was ramping up the pressure. It accused NPR and PBS of bias. On April 14, for example, it issued  a formal statement  that called their offerings \"radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news'.\" NPR and PBS's chief executives have rejected the accusations of bias. On May 1, Trump issued an executive order that no federal money should go to the two public broadcasting networks. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations then  filed suit against the White House , saying they were being unlawfully punished because the president did not like their news coverage. They contended the executive order represented a violation of First Amendment protections. Their suit names CPB as a defendant as well for, in their characterization, bending to the president's will. In Monday's legal filing, CPB agreed that the executive order was precisely the sort of government interference that Congress sought to prevent in establishing CPB as it did.   In the summer, Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress, urged on by Trump, pulled back all $1.1 billion for future public broadcasting that had already been approved and signed into law by the president. Throughout the legal battle, NPR has said, regardless of the outcome of the case, it would work with Public Media Infrastructure.   NPR's broader constitutional case against Trump's executive order purporting to ban federal funding of public media continues. A hearing on its merits is scheduled for December.

Chowdhury \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 4:27 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A court in Bangladesh sentenced ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death for crimes against humanity on Monday, for her role in a crackdown on last year's student-led uprising which the United Nations says left  up to 1,400 people dead . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The country's International Crimes Tribunal, a domestic war crimes court in the capital Dhaka, also sentenced Hasina's home minister, Asaduzzaman Khan, to death. A three-member tribunal announced the ruling in a session that was broadcast live and lasted several hours. Hasina and Khan fled to India in August last year and were sentenced in absentia. A third suspect, a former police chief, was sentenced to five years in prison after becoming a state witness against Hasina and pleading guilty to crimes against humanity. The ICT was set up in 2009 to investigate and prosecute those accused of war crimes during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. At the time of its creation, it was accused by Human Rights Watch and other groups of not meeting international standards. On Monday, HRW's South Asia deputy director Meenakshi Ganguly  posted  on social media: \"Bangladesh should ensure a credible justice system, abolish capital punishment.\" Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam insists that Hasina — who was found guilty, among other charges, of ordering the use of lethal force by her security services — received a fair trial. \"Our tribunal was developed in line with the Nuremberg trials. It has met all international standards. No one can point to anywhere where those standards have not been met,\" he told NPR. \"Their defense lawyer was given enough time to come up with the response. He could not take instruction from the accused as they are fugitives. If they had been present, they could have given their testimonies and provided further witnesses, and they would have been given further time as per the law.\" Hasina, 78, denounced the verdict as biased and politically motivated. She released a statement through a public relations firm, saying: \"The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate. ... I wholly deny the accusations that have been made against me in the ICT. I mourn all of the deaths that occurred in July and August of last year, on both sides of the political divide. But neither I nor other political leaders ordered the killing of protestors. ... I was given no fair chance to defend myself in court, nor even to have lawyers of my own choice represent me in absentia.\" Pent-up grievance   about   corruption   in the government   prompted the protesters — many of them young people —  to revolt.   The uprising started in July 2024, with demands to abolish government job allocations. It later morphed into a wider anti-government movement and ended with Hasina resigning her post after 15 years in power and fleeing in a helicopter. Monday's verdict comes as the country continues to grapple with instability and violence, with tensions mounting in the days ahead of the ruling. The interim government, led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, stepped up security, with paramilitary border guards and police deployed in Dhaka and many other parts of the country, and soldiers surrounding the tribunal premises. Experts believe the verdict will likely reignite the cycle of violence that has come to characterize Bangladeshi politics. Naomi Hossain, a development studies professor at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies told NPR: \"After the uprising, we might have had a process of justice and peace and reconciliation. We didn't have that. We've had the same as before. We call it accountability, but it's more like political revenge.\" She added: \"What really matters is, many people think that this is a kind of justice and that no other kind of justice was going to be achieved.\" Yunus has banned the activities of Hasina's Awami League party ahead of elections set for February. In a statement following the verdict, Bangladesh's Ministry of Home Affairs urged India to extradite both Hasina and Khan soon. India's Foreign Ministry  in a statement acknowledged  the tribunal's verdict but fell short of stating whether it would hand them over to Dhaka. Hasina cannot appeal the verdict unless she returns to Bangladesh — a move that could further ignite the country's political turmoil. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98165","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:27:00-05:00","title":"FEMA Acting Chief David Richardson Departs After 6 Months on the Job","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer and former head of DHS’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office, served as acting chief of FEMA for six months, from May to November 2025, before resigning amid criticism for his delayed response to the deadly Texas floods in July 2025.

Richardson departs after 6 months on the job \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 5:27 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SAN DIEGO — The acting chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency left his job Monday after just six months, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the latest disruption in a year of mass staff departures, program cuts and policy upheaval at the agency charged with managing federal disaster response. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       David Richardson, who in his brief term remained largely out of public sight, is leaving the post after he faced a wave of criticism for his handling of the deadly Texas floods earlier this year. He replaced previous acting head Cameron Hamilton in May. DHS did not comment on the details of Richardson's departure, but a FEMA employee familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Richardson resigned. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the changes with the media. \"The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security extend their sincere appreciation to the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator, David Richardson, for his dedicated service and wish him continued success in his return to the private sector,\" a DHS spokesperson told The Associated Press. The Washington Post first reported the news about Richardson's resignation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A former Marine Corps officer who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and also led the DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office, Richardson had no previous emergency management experience when he assumed the role of \"senior official performing the duties of administrator\" in May. After replacing Hamilton, who was fired one day after telling a House appropriations committee that he did not think FEMA should be eliminated, Richardson vowed to help fulfill President Donald Trump's goal to push more disaster recovery responsibilities to the states and told FEMA employees he would \" run right over \" anyone who tried to obstruct that mission. But Richardson's leadership was questioned by members of Congress and FEMA employees, particularly after remaining largely out of sight after the deadly Texas floods last July that killed at least 136 people. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When asked by a House committee in July why he did not arrive on the ground until one week after the disaster, Richardson said he stayed in Washington, D.C., to \"kick down the doors of bureaucracy,\" but also said he was camping with his sons for the July 4 weekend when the floods first hit and initially helped manage the response from inside his truck. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also kept a tight grip on FEMA programs and spending, requiring that she personally approve any agency expenditure over $100,000. Richardson had denied reports that the approval policy slowed down FEMA's response in Texas. FEMA Chief of Staff and former cybersecurity official Karen Evans will assume the role on Dec. 1, according to DHS. The FEMA administrator is required by law to have emergency management experience, but the Trump administration has circumvented those requirements up to now by appointing temporary leaders. The agency has undergone major upheaval since Trump returned to office in January promising to vastly overhaul if not eliminate the agency. About 18% of the agency's permanent full-time employees had departed as of June, including 24 senior-level staffers, according to the Government Accountability Office. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration also has slashed mitigation funding, placed requirements on preparedness grants that compel recipients to comply with Trump's immigration agenda, and denied several states' requests for major disaster declaration requests. DHS did not respond to questions about whether Richardson will still lead the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. Trump appointed a 12-member review council led by Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deliver recommendations on how to reform FEMA and push more responsibility to the states for disaster preparedness, response and recovery. The council is expected to deliver its recommendations in December. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607994","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00+00:00","title":"More women are renting dresses, coats and ugly sweaters as clothing prices tick up","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As clothing prices rise due to inflation and tariffs, more women are turning to rental platforms like Rent the Runway and Nuuly to access high-quality, trend-driven fashion without the financial burden of purchasing.

Monroe \n        \n           Monday, November 17, 2025 • 5:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Lydia Patel made a big decision two years ago:  she stopped buying clothes.  \"In my busy life nowadays — I realized especially after Covid — I go to work in scrubs,\" explains the Minnesota pharmacist, YouTube creator and mom of three. \"I don't dress up anymore for work, so I really don't need a whole lot of new clothes.\" After seeing the outfits she rarely wore to kids' birthday parties and daytime events languishing in her closet, she thought, why not rent her wardrobe instead? While  Rent the Runway set the tone  for the clothing rental industry when it launched 16 years ago — offering designer gowns for a night — it and trendy competitors such as Nuuly now let consumers borrow a set number of items, including dresses, jeans and even winter coats, for a monthly price.  The concept was intriguing to Patel. \"I kind of looked into rental as an option because I don't really want to hang on to pieces forever,\" she said. \"By the time I have something else to go to, the trends will have changed. My tastes might have changed.\" Over two years later, Patel says, deciding to rent her clothes \"has opened up access to more quality pieces that are unique and fit what I want to wear at the moment without breaking the bank.\"  And she doesn't have to worry about storing or washing the items she borrows. At the end of the rental term, she returns the pieces to the companies and they handle the shipping and cleaning. \"I don't even know what you do with silk — and I don't want to,\" she says. Patel is just one of more than a half a million women — this industry caters almost exclusively to women — who are using clothing rental platforms, according to some of the companies' public data. The industry is worth $2.6 billion, and is projected to more than double in value by 2035, according to market research firm,  Future Market Insights . Its growth is a signal that shoppers are looking for budget-friendly alternatives just as inflation and tariffs threaten to push clothing prices higher. The price of new clothes is rising — and tariffs aren't helping Apparel prices have risen 9% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's far less than overall inflation, which has  increased nearly 26%  over the same time period. Still, experts believe, as tariffs settle in and make their way through the supply chain and into stores, consumers will start to see price tags change.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This winter will likely see some strong increases in apparel sales. They'll be \"driven by inflation and tariff-related price increases as brands and retailers have to pay more to import clothing,\" says Sky Canaves, an analyst at the market research firm eMarketer. For some brands, this means passing on costs to consumers will be \"unavoidable,\" she says. Barely any  garments are made in the U.S.  today. If you're in the market for a new coat this winter, you may already be feeling the pinch. Jackets and outerwear prices rose 24% on average over the past year, according to an  AlixPartners study . The cost increases have sent some shoppers exploring the rental and secondhand markets.  \"Services that can offer consumers the opportunity to keep their wardrobes fresh on an ongoing basis are really benefiting,\" says Canaves. It's an opportunity not lost on Patel. She estimates that if she purchased instead of rented her clothes, it would cost her thousands of dollars. Instead, using rental for just six months out of the year keeps her within the $500 she budgets annually for clothing. \"I put my subscription on pause most of the time,\" she says. She reactivates her membership before events or trips. Nuuly President Dave Hayne says that's OK: \"We know that subscribers aren't going to need us every month of the year, and that's fine.\"  He says the company has made it easy for customers to take a break and return when they need the service. And so far, Hayne says, subscribers have been coming back. The rental industry can't escape tariffs  However, rental fashion platforms are not immune from the impact of tariffs, which are leading to shipment cancellations and production delays. Fewer items reaching U.S. shores means fewer options for shoppers, Canaves says. Because rental platforms must keep their stock of styles constantly refreshed to meet customers' expectations, \"they're exposed to many of the same cost pressures facing traditional retailers,\" she explains. It's harder for fashion rental companies to quickly pass on increased costs to consumers because their subscriptions are offered at set monthly prices. Hayne says Nuuly is taking multiple steps to manage the challenge of tariffs.  \"[We're] thinking about where we're sourcing from and where brands are buying from, and how we split costs,\" he says. Unlike other rental platforms, Nuuly is part of a large fashion company that also owns Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters. Hayne calls the relationship a \"big plus\" for Nuuly, allowing it to work closely with those brands on buying certain styles as well as purchasing apparel at cost. Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman says while her company has had \"bigger fish to fry\" than tariffs — after  losing over half its subscriber base during the pandemic  — it pays clothing brands based on the performance of its inventory, instead of buying the items outright. \"So we've been less affected than most,\" she says. Decking the halls in a rental The holidays are the busiest time for fashion rental as people shop for that special look for office parties, family gatherings and New Year's Eve that they can return once the party season ends. But the added demand strains existing inventory challenges. Both Nuuly and Rent the Runway have taken efforts to avoid running out of items. \"We heard from [our customers] that the biggest problem we had in our business was inventory availability,\" Hyman says. To address this, Rent the Runway  committed to doubling the amount of styles  available to its subscribers this year. But Hayne admits it's hard to get those numbers right. \"One of the most important things for this business to be successful is trying to balance inventory levels with subscriber levels,\" he said. Both Hyman and Hayne's advice to consumers looking to rent for the holidays: rent as soon as you can. This busy holiday season Patel says she'll be wearing rented clothes. She hasn't decided whether   it will be a fun \"ugly sweater\" or a velvety dress. Regardless, she plans to return the items in January so she doesn't have to do the laundry. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   It's almost the holidays, and with it comes office parties, family gatherings and the dreaded question of what to wear to those things.

Rising inflation and tariffs are complicating the hunt for this year's hottest ugly sweater. But as NPR's Kristian Monroe explains, there's an alternative to buying it. KRISTIAN MONROE, BYLINE: Two years ago, Lydia Patel made a big decision. The pharmacist, content creator and mom of three was sick of seeing all the clothes she used to wear to kids' birthday parties and events languishing inside her closet. LYDIA PATEL: I go to work in scrubs. I don't dress up for work anymore. So I really don't need a whole lot of new clothes. MONROE: So she decided to stop buying them. PATEL: I don't really want to hang on to pieces forever. By the time I have something else to go to, the trends will have changed. My taste might have changed. MONROE: But that didn't mean no new clothes. She decided, why not rent instead? Patel joins thousands of women borrowing high-end, premium clothes like dresses, jeans and even winter coats each month for a fraction of the original price. She says renting has opened up a whole new world, a world of luxury fabrics. PATEL: I now get to wear silk items that I otherwise would never bother - cleaning and, like - I don't even know what you do with - I don't know what you do with silk, and I don't want to. MONROE: The popularity of rental fashion has been fueled by fears that inflation and tariffs could be back in vogue. While clothing prices are up 9% since the start of COVID, that pales in comparison to the rise of overall inflation over that same period. But what the future holds for the cost of clothing, well, that remains unclear. Nearly all clothing in the United States is made overseas in countries like China and Vietnam, which face up to 20% in additional taxes imposed by the Trump administration this year. As these tariffs settle in, Sky Canaves, principal analyst at EMARKETER, says they'll make their way through the supply chain and into shopping bags. SKY CANAVES: As brands and retailers have to pay more to import clothing, they will have to pass on those costs - at least some of those costs - to consumers. MONROE: That could affect rental fashion, which isn't immune to the impact of tariffs. One of the biggest rental platforms is Nuuly, owned by the same company that owns Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People. And it's working to tackle the challenge of tariffs. DAVE HAYNE: We're definitely trying to manage through it and doing a lot to manage through. MONROE: That's Nuuly president Dave Hayne. He says buying wholesale, working alongside his popular sister brands, is helping. And if customers are happy with their clothes, Nuuly's happy to sell it to them at a discount. The goal - to save the holidays from the tariff grinch. But not so fast, Cindy Lou Who. The holidays are just one of the busiest times of year for renting, and that added demand could mean the odds of getting your hands on that light-up Rudolph sweater might be harder than you thought. Companies like Rent the Runway and Nuuly are trying to avoid running out of items, but Hayne admits it's hard to get those numbers right. HAYNE: One of the most important things for this business to be successful is trying to kind of balance inventory levels with subscriber levels. MONROE: Hayne says if you are hoping to dress to impress at your office party, rent as soon as you can. So renting is what Lydia Patel is planning to do this busy holiday season. PATEL: I don't miss buying stuff. I - seeing what I have in my closet, I do not want to add anything else to it. MONROE: While she's not sure if she'll be competing with other renters to grab that must-have, fun ugly sweater or wearing something a bit more traditional, odds are, she'll be returning it in January.

Katherine Fan first got into credit card points after college. She lived in the U.S. and her family lived in Taiwan, and she wanted to find a way to visit them on a regular basis — but she couldn't afford the cost of airfare on her entry level salary of $28,000 a year.  She had good credit, so she signed up for a card that offered significant travel rewards for spending. And through that card, she earned enough points and miles to get deeply discounted airline tickets to Asia.  Since then, Fan, a correspondent covering credit cards for Business Insider, has become a credit card points evangelist. She's used her cards to earn points for perks like hotel and air travel upgrades and cash back for gas and groceries. She says as long as you have good credit and can pay your bills on time, you can get into the points game.  Fan offers advice on how to get started. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  What exactly are credit card points? Credit card points are essentially like currency.  [To entice customers to borrow and spend more], credit card issuers like Mastercard, Citi or Capital One will give you points or miles to reward you for every dollar that you spend with them. And you can redeem those points to pay for travel, gift cards, groceries, even free or discounted access to events like concerts or award shows.  What do you need to get these kinds of credit cards?  Good credit.  If your credit score is above a 660, you'll be eligible for some good credit cards [that offer basic perks like cash back or double points or miles for purchases]. You probably want to have something closer to a 720 credit score if you're looking for one of the premium cards, such as the American Express Platinum card or the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Those offer big rewards like luxury hotel stays, travel lounge access and upgraded air travel. \n       \n      Related Story:  Tricks to improve your credit score — and keep it high \n       What's the best kind of card to start out with?  Get a card that makes sense with your spending habits.  For example, if you're a big traveler, you may want a card that offers perks on airfare or hotels. If you're on the road a lot, you may opt for a card that provides car insurance, car rental discounts or extra points for gas. Or get a cash back credit card for everyday groceries and gas.  Make sure it's in your wallet and it's signed up for autopay on your utilities [to make sure you're using the card on a regular basis]. You'll probably end up with a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars in your bank account at the end of the year. What should I know before signing up for a card?  Make sure you find the right fit.  If you read a stellar review for a travel credit card but you don't travel very much, then maybe that one's not the best fit for you. Consider annual fees.  If you're hesitant about committing to paying an annual fee [the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, for example, has a  $550 annual fee ], there are a lot of great $0 annual fee credit cards out there. The Freedom Flex card from Chase comes to mind. You get 3% cash back on dining out without having to pay any annual fee and you still get good benefits on things like purchase protection for stolen or damaged items. Be aware it can be easy to rack up debt in the quest to earn rewards.  New survey data from Bankrate  says 48% of credit card holders carry debt from month to month. While that percentage is down slightly from 50% in 2024, this statistic is still a cause for concern for personal finance experts because of high credit card interest rates. Some credit card issuers offer $0 annual fees for the first year but start charging fees the next year. Can I just cancel my card the next year? Every time you open or close a card, it hurts your credit history a little bit [changing your debt to credit utilization ratio — or how much you owe compared to your overall credit limit — may impact your credit score]. So as a general rule, downgrade [to a less premium card] instead of canceling your cards.  For example, my Chase Freedom card, which has no annual fee, used to be my Chase Sapphire Reserve card, but I didn't want to pay $550 to keep that card open. Downgrading allowed me to retain my history and my credit limit as well. \n       \n      Related Story:  Life Kit answers your pressing questions about inflation \n       The tricky thing about points is they can feel like free money. But that's not exactly true.  It can be super tempting to spend more than you should just because you can earn more points, so you have to know when to stop. You can't just go buy $500 worth of shoes and jewelry and be like, \"Oh, it's fine. I'm going to get points back for this.\" Yes, you will. But was that $500 that you needed to spend?  You want to plan your spending around what already makes sense for your life and then see where points can offset or subsidize some of that cost.  What's your best financial advice for people starting out with credit card points? Pay off your balances in full every month. If you forget to pay off your credit card, it's not worth it because the interest rates are so high on credit cards. So if you struggle at all with the temptation of treating a credit card like free money [rather than a loan you have to pay back], then don't get into it.

I love my job - getting paid to be curious, to learn stuff and then get to share those things with all of you - my dream. But you know what's even better than working? Going on vacation. I mean, who wouldn't love to take a break from their lives every now and then - traveling to new places, treating yourself to good food or hotel stays or new adventures, or just quality time with loved ones. That's the dream. But for a lot of us, big trips or big spends can feel like just that - a financial fantasy, a luxury reserved for the likes of moguls or jet-setting celebrities, or at least the very well-off. Personal finance and travel journalist Katherine Fan says not so. You don't have to be a millionaire to make some of those dreamy extras into a reality, she says. What you need is credit card points and an understanding of how to use them. KATHERINE FAN: I travel a ton on points. I actually got into it because I grew up overseas, and my family was in Taiwan for most of my early, early adult years, including right after college. So I would spend all of my points getting back and forth to Taiwan to see my family every year. TAGLE: Gaming the credit card points system might feel too lofty or too complicated to be worth pursuing, but Katherine says using credit card rewards can be super simple and can serve lots of people, especially those who are most in need of some extra cushion. FAN: I made at $28,000 a year in my very first full-time job, so, you know, no extra cash there for a 1,500, $2,000 flight home. So that's how I kind of got started in points and miles travel, and then it just kind of blew up from there. TAGLE: Katherine has spent years covering credit cards for outlets like The Points Guy and Nerdwallet. And what she's taken away from all of that reporting... FAN: Anyone can get into this. TAGLE: Whether the crush of inflation has you wishing for some extra help with the groceries, or you've been scheming to finally take that very belated honeymoon, or you're just a fan of free stuff, credit card points could be your answer. FAN: It's not limited to super rich people. It's not limited to people who travel a lot for work. It's definitely not limited to, you know, young professionals who are single and don't have kids. TAGLE: But let's note for the record, there is a barrier to entry here. You'll need good credit to get started. FAN: There's a way to make it work for pretty much everybody as long as you're able to build up your credit score to at least a really good level. Ideally, you'd like to have an excellent credit score. TAGLE: If you have questions on how to do that, we've got another episode on how to raise your credit score that you should definitely check out. But in this episode of LIFE KIT, we're talking how to make the most of credit card points for the everyday credit card user. Katherine will help us understand the credit card rewards system, break down how to find the best cards for your lifestyle, and she's got lots of recommendations for first timers. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, Katherine, so let's just start at the very beginning - the very, very basics. What are credit card points, and why would people want them? FAN: So credit card points are essentially like currency. So credit card issuers give you points or miles to reward you for every dollar that you spend with them. And you can use those points in turn to pay for travel, offset your grocery bills - many different reasons right there. Every issuer, like Chase or American Express or Citi or Capital One, offers their own points system that you can get cards for. So not all points and miles are the same. Different issuers value their points differently, and credit card points are valuable because they are untaxed. So if you spend $1,000 and you earn 3% cash back on every bit of that, you get $33 that you don't have to pay tax on. Credit card points can be invaluable as well for transferring to hotels and airlines to get some outsized value. So if there's a flight that's going for $5,000 in business class, and you can pay 80,000 points to get on that particular flight, then your points are earning you a higher value than if you were to transfer them to cash or if you were to pay for that flight in cash outright. TAGLE: OK. Yes, please, to all of this. Points - what's the difference between cashback or rewards or loyalty programs? Are we talking about the same thing? FAN: Let's see. The most simple way I can describe it is this way. You can work with an issuer like Chase or American Express. They have their own form of currency for some of their cards. So for AmEx, you've got membership rewards points. For Chase, you've got ultimate rewards points. And these are all points that the issuer gives you. And they're kind of worth nothing until you decide what to do with them, of course. So let's say Chase - I use Chase a lot. If you were to use your Chase points, you can log into the Chase portal and buy flights, rental cars, hotel stays directly through the Chase portal. But you can also transfer your Chase points to various different partners. Two of the easiest ones to think of are United and Marriott, for instance, or Southwest. All of your points are worth the same amount on a 1-to-1 ratio if you transfer them over. So one point from Chase can equal one point for Southwest, one point for Marriott, one point for United, and so on, so forth. TAGLE: Katherine, why do companies do this? Why are credit card points a thing at all? FAN: So the reason is just because, you know, in America, we love spending money. And credit card issuers, hotels, airlines, you know, rental car companies, Target, Victoria's Secret - all of these companies have recognized that if they get a credit card that they can get you to sign up for, it's one additional layer of connection that they have to you, and one guarantee that you're interested enough in their brand to invest your money in it and to purchase their products and to learn more about their offerings. So these points are a way to create an artificial currency that keeps you attached to an issuer. Since they're busy out there getting our money, it makes sense that we want to come up with the most efficient way and the most effective way of utilizing the resources that we've invested in them. TAGLE: Sure. So it's a tie. It's a tie that will keep you connected to a place or to a company and also incentivizes you to stay. FAN: Incentivize you to spend money with those credit cards, you know? TAGLE: Yeah. FAN: Like, I spend my rent money with this card because they're going to give me points. I spend my gas, my grocery money with this card because they give me points. So it's a competition for your business. TAGLE: A lot of times gaming the card system, the points system, feels like a wealthy person's game. You know, like you have to spend 10K in a month on each, you know, to earn a hundred thousand points for a free flight to Europe, etc., etc. Can credit card points benefit budget spenders too? FAN: Yes, absolutely. I would say that there are a number of great cards out there that don't charge you an annual fee. You don't have to do anything crazy to get started in the points and miles game. Just pick one card that gives you really good flexible points and go from there. If you don't already have something major in mind, you know, maybe get a cashback credit card for everyday groceries, gas. Make sure it's in your wallet. Make sure it's signed up for autopay on your utilities. Even just by doing that, you'll probably end up with a few hundred dollars, a couple thousand dollars in your bank account at the end of the year. So easy. No problem. You're earning a little bit - a dollar or two per transaction. That adds up really fast over the course of a year. Another card that's a little higher up is the Chase Sapphire Preferred. There's a $95 annual fee. This is one of the best cards you can get because not only do you get great points on travel and dining and all that good stuff, you also get some of the best rental car insurance on your credit card that you could possibly have. Your credit card will protect you if your baggage gets delayed, if your baggage gets lost, if your trip gets delayed, if you end up having your flights canceled altogether - for the most part, this card will cover any of those issues you have and then some. TAGLE: So I'm hearing a lot about the fine print of things that you should look for before you sign up for a card - so travel insurance benefits, travel coverage. What other things should people be looking out for in that fine print before signing up for a card? FAN: Well, I think a lot of times when you're thinking about how to sign up for a credit card or what to consider, this is where research really helps. There are a ton of websites out there that are designed specifically to help you understand that. Credit card reviews will kind of help you see what the pros and cons of each card can be. Now, the challenging thing for any of these sites is that obviously they don't know who you are. So you kind of have to keep your profile in mind. If you don't travel a lot and you read a really stellar review for a travel credit card, it kind of may sound like it makes sense, but once you think about how often you travel, then maybe it's not the best fit for you. I would say at the end of the day, if you just look for best no-annual-fee credit card, best travel credit card, you Google those terms, you'll consistently see across all of the issuers that the same names come up over and over again. TAGLE: What about people who aren't planning to travel as much? Does it make sense for people who aren't going to be traveling a lot in the future? FAN: Yeah, I think so. I still think it's super valuable to use credit cards for a number of reasons. When I'm using a debit card, I'm not earning anything back on it. However, if I use a credit card, I not only have purchase protection because I can submit a fraud report if I need to. I can send in a request if my item is defective and the manufacturer or the retailer refuses to refund me for something that's clearly defective. There's so many benefits that come alongside of credit cards, not just the cashback aspect. As far as rewards go, you know, at the end of the day, if all you care about is just making sure that you get a little bit of return on your investment, just get a no-annual-fee credit card and sign up for something that offers you cashback. You could always save it in dual form. So all of those points I mentioned with Chase, for instance, you can use directly as cash sort of to pay off the statement on your balance. So a lot of times if you use those cashback points, you can use it as cash as well to write off certain expenses. So if you come from a family where you really don't think you travel that often, you can still earn up to 3% back or 5% back on groceries, on cash. I always think that's a pretty solid deal compared to 0%. TAGLE: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. When people are signing up for a new card, can they expect their credit to be dinged just for signing up for a new card? FAN: Yes. So that's a very understandable concern. And the truth is, yes, you'll get maybe one or two points off of your credit score just for that initial few months when that inquiry goes through. But as a general rule, if your credit score is above a 650 to 680, in that range, you'll be eligible for some good credit cards. You probably want to have something closer to a 720 credit score if you're looking for one of the excellent cards, such as, you know, the American Express Platinum card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, those are some of the premium cards that often come to mind when people think of credit scores. So you're definitely going to want an excellent credit score in that 680 to 720 minimum range to be considered. But there are a lot of factors that go into approval as well. So on your end, you're doing your due diligence. The issuer's also kind of looking at you like, oh, you know, Andee - is Andee someone that we feel comfortable giving our credit card to? If we do, what credit limit will we give her? So that will vary from person to person. TAGLE: And what about on the other side? A lot of people - I've heard - I've seen guidance, read guidance about, you know, sign up with a credit card for that first year where they're not going to give you that annual fee and then that second year people cancel. What are your thoughts on that? FAN: So I'm a little torn on this one because I also started out as one of those people who cancelled really quickly. I would say my general rule now is to kind of think about the card holistically. Does it hurt you to keep it? Does it help you to keep it? For me, I would say if you can downgrade your credit card to a different product that doesn't charge you an annual fee, then you'll want to keep that card open instead of canceling it. So I'll give you an example. My Chase Freedom card right now used to be my Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card. And the reason I downgraded that was because I was starting to use a different card that had many of the same benefits. And I didn't want to pay $550 a year to keep that card open. So I downgraded it to a $0 annual fee credit card because that allowed me to keep that credit history open. You know, every time you open or close a card, it hits your credit history a little bit. So I kept my card open. And with that product change, which is what it's called, I was able to retain my history with the card, my credit limit with the card as well. So as a general rule, I would say don't cancel a card unless you have a really good reason to do so. And if it's just for money, then look to see if there's a product or another credit card, so to speak, that you could downgrade to. TAGLE: Let's talk annual fees. What are they? What should you keep in mind before signing up for a card? FAN: So annual fees are a really important part of considering your credit card. If you're just getting started, and you're really hesitant about the commitment, look for a $0 annual fee credit card. However, if you want something really bougie like that lounge access in the airports, you're going to be looking at several hundred dollars per year just to hold that credit card. But once again, there's a wide, wide range of really great credit cards. I have both zero-annual-fee cards and a few really premium $600-a-year types of cards. If you find yourself spending too much on annual fees, dial back a little bit. Think about which airlines you're flying the most. Think about which hotels you fly the most. And then let the rest of them go if you're not traveling with those entities. TAGLE: I want to talk a little bit about what points might cost us. You know, you get points by spending money and then when you cash them in, it can feel like yay, free money. But that's not exactly true. What's the actual cost of points? FAN: Yeah, well, the number one concern is that it's super tempting to spend more than you should just because you can earn more points. You know, it's a little bit like a carnival fare. So you kind of got to know when to stop. You can't just go buy, you know, $500 worth of fine shoes and jewelry and be like, oh, it's fine. I'm going to get points back for this. Yes, you will. But was that $500 that you needed to spend? Another expense, I would say, as far as points go is it's really tempting to hoard them. But obviously the issuers, the hotels, the airlines are always working to make sure that they get their value back as well. So a lot of times they will end up devaluing points or change something with the system. So once again, remember that points are kind of a currency. So if the economy changes as far as points go, then your ability to redeem them, the value that they're worth is fluctuating as well. So you really don't want to sit on a massive bank of points. My typical rule of thumb is if a flight or a hotel is within a certain dollar band - I would say $200 or less after fees - then I'll typically pay for it with cash, pretty much no matter where I am. But if let's say I'm looking for a hotel for New Year's Eve and it's super expensive, that's where points really help, because then I can look for a property where I can put down, you know, 10,000, 20,000 points instead of spending $800 a night. So the cost of points is just recognizing that, A, it's really tempting to try to earn more of them and spend money you don't need to and then, B, hoarding them and not actually spending them. TAGLE: Is there a biggest mistake people make with their credit cards? FAN: Well, obviously, I'm going to say it because I need to, but if you forget to pay off your credit card, it's totally not worth it because the interest rates are so high on credit cards. So the number one cardinal rule of getting into the points and miles game through credit cards is pay off your balances in full. And if you happen to struggle at all with the temptation of treating a credit card like free money, then really don't get into it, because once again, the rewards are great. And so it's really tempting to keep going down that route and be like, oh, I could get more and I can go to all these places. Not a great idea. I would say on the bright side, what you can learn from getting credit cards is responsible usage as well, because if you were raised to think that credit cards are the devil and you should use cash for everything, even just starting with one or two basic cards that give you a little bit of peace of mind or a little bit more luxury when you travel, that's what I'm super passionate about, is just making sure that you're having fun in a sustainable way that complements your lifestyle instead of dominating it. TAGLE: Yeah. FAN: So you don't want to plan a trip just because you have points to go somewhere. Rather, you want to plan what makes sense for your life and then see where points can offset or subsidize some of that cost. TAGLE: Right. So have an understanding of your life and find a card that fits into it. Don't fit your life for your card. FAN: Exactly. TAGLE: I like that a lot. I'm hearing, you know, there's a card for every need, for every lifestyle. You've said to be clear about what your needs are, what your wants are, and don't go wild with it. Just be ready to pay it all off. FAN: Exactly. Exactly. TAGLE: Katherine, you are just a fountain of helpful information. I am so excited. You've made me feel so enthusiastic about getting into the credit card points game. Thank you. FAN: Thank you so much for having me. It's been so fun talking about one of my favorite topics. Anyone who wants to reach out to me via social media or anything like that, please feel free. I love talking about this. And I'm happy to help you figure out how to get your own strategy in place. TAGLE: Yes, please. Free money for all. FAN: Mmm hmm. TAGLE: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

gardener installed a pop-up wetland in the LA River. Here's how — and why \n         By Emma Bowman \n        \n           Monday, November 17, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LOS ANGELES — To many locals, the Los Angeles River — hugged by concrete embankments and heavy vehicle traffic — hardly seems like a river at all. The waterway bisecting the city was converted to a giant storm drain nearly a century ago to contain flood waters. Today, it's an extension of the urban network of concrete, running beneath freeways and bridges as it collects all kinds of refuse: spent tires, scrap metal, trash thrown from car windows. But when Doug Rosenberg came upon a shopping cart tipped over in the river's shallow waters back in 2020, he saw the   potential to meet nature halfway. \"It had begun to bloom some greenery around it, and there was a great blue heron perched on the cart, hunting in this little spot,\" Rosenberg recalled. \"That was when it clicked for me — that any 3D geometry at all in that river channel will trap sediment, will begin a micro-bloom of ecosystem.\" The 36-year-old artist saw an amusing paradox — life sprouting from the metal cart — that planted the seed for his next project: a pop-up wetland in the middle of the LA River. In a desolate part of downtown, he pushed large rocks from the riverbanks into the water and arranged them in loose, concentric circles. The structure would trap sediment, allowing life to take root. In other words, Rosenberg produced a patch of watery land — like a marsh or swamp — to support plants and animals. Over the course of 10 weeks, the simple assemblage of rocks spawned a totally new 10-by-20-foot green island in the middle of the 100-foot-wide channel. Rosenberg calls it performance art: a visual statement that carries a call to action. The wetland installation isn't quite what he'd call \"impactful ecology,\" but rather a work of art to show environmental good can be low-tech and small-scale. \"The impetus behind this project is to show that the barrier to entry doesn't exist. To basically provide a simple format for action,\" he said. Guerrilla gardeners It's not so much that the barriers don't exist — they do — he's just flouting them, city officials say. Despite his good intentions, none of this is legal. He's a guerrilla gardener: someone who plants where they're not supposed to. The federal government deems this flood control channel  \"navigable water,\"  providing protections under the Clean Water Act and   making any unauthorized changes to its course illegal. That  includes obstructions and modifications  in the channel, such as dredging or disposal of materials like rocks. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Across the country, as urban development replaces  tree cover  and natural landscapes with buildings and parking lots, guerrilla gardeners flout local ordinances to disperse seeds or otherwise alter their environment, usually with an overriding mission  to reclaim underused public spaces . They seek to grow  healthy produce in urban food deserts , capture greenhouse gases and beautify their neighborhoods. The movement has taken many forms, from creating a verdant oasis for the nation's largest housing project in  New York City  to grooming a  busy bike path in Seattle . Here in LA, Rosenberg's guerrilla tactics include trespassing and planting without permits in the publicly managed waterway. Getting to his wetland requires jumping railroad tracks and scaling down the steep side of the channel to the riverbed. But as far as he's concerned, it's open to the public. \"I feel like it's possible to relate to a city the way we're used to relating to nature — or as we imagine we could relate to unspoiled wilderness,\" he said. But officials and longtime river advocates say people can't plant wherever they want, and that guerrilla actors have the potential to do more harm than good. \"Even small changes can affect water quality, habitat, and safety downstream,\" said Ben Orbison, a spokesman for Friends of the LA River, an advocacy group focused on revitalization efforts, including cleanups along the waterway. \"Restoration is incredibly important, but works best when guided by ecology and collaboration,\" with local and federal agencies to prioritize safety, he added. Chief among the concerns is flooding. \"If you have rocks, if you have vegetation, if you have other things that slow the water down then it builds up faster. That's where you get the overtopping of the channel,\" said Ben Harris, an attorney with Los Angeles Waterkeeper, an environmental watchdog group. The whole reason the Los Angeles River became a concrete straightjacket was to prevent a repeat of the city's devastating floods in the 1930s.  The Army Corps of Engineers  channelized and paved the once-meandering river. The roughly 51-mile channel continues to serve as a hydro-highway shuttling stormwater runoff from the mountains to the sea. Generally, local officials and river advocates are far ahead of Rosenberg in revitalizing the channel. In recent years, the city has built several projects under  a master plan  designed to resurrect some of the river's natural habitat and expand public access. But  progress is slow . Legal roadblocks and budget constraints have delayed the implementation of many proposals. Beyond the bike paths and trails lining the waterway, the efforts are most visible in parts of the river where the soil was left unpaved. Willows, egrets and frogs populate soft-bottom sections where springs and a high water table would reject a concrete casing. And, upstream from Rosenberg's wetland, there's a plan in the works to build what's essentially a larger, permanent version of the artist's project. Long before Rosenberg plunked his first rock into its waters, the city adopted a plan to turn an  11-mile section of the river into a wetland  to allow the safe passage of salmon. Still, some city staff give guerrilla artists a lot of credit for laying the groundwork. \"The biggest shift points in the river's history were made, in my opinion, not necessarily the legal way,\" said Kat Superfisky, an urban ecologist with the city, but from \"the community advocate, artist, guerrilla kind of efforts.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       'He's onto something' On social media, Rosenberg shares his art with a wider audience than was made available to his artist-activist predecessors. People curious about his project have reached out to him, asking how they can help support it. He's invited them to join him on his visits to the wetland, where he's put them to work. Others have taken issue with Rosenberg's accommodation of an invasive plant species in his wetland. It's mostly populated by Goodding's willow, a native species, and creeping water primrose, a non-native invasive. Those non-native plants tend to crowd out native habitat, drink more water and lead to increased use of toxic pesticides. Some people accustomed to reading the river's currents say the wetland will be gone before it can cause any lasting harm to the river. In the likely event of a heavy rain, the rising tide in the river channel could wipe out the wetland, washing it into the ocean. From an ecological standpoint, Superfisky says \"he's onto something,\" in terms of thinking about how to recreate conditions found in a natural, sprawling river using the impractical medium he's given. The channel functions like a straight, unobstructed tube, she said. But the placement of rocks allow sediment buildup and produce varied flow patterns — much like grooves in braiding streams — to set up stiller pockets where wildlife can thrive. But it all falls apart if he's not accounting for flood risk, the ecologist said. Harris, of the watchdog LA Waterkeeper, thinks flood management and ecological values can coexist in a concrete channel. Removing the concrete would open up more possibilities, he said, adding that there are \"a variety of nature-based solutions\" for the channel that support flood management. But an overhaul of the existing concrete flood management system would also require big shifts in mindset. \"It's kind of a scary thought,\" he said. \"If you imagine being a policymaker in government and you're trying to do that, you have to turn things on its head.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Army Corps of Engineers has not responded to requests for comment. According to its website, the agency works to clear vegetation  it warns can clog the channel  and hamper flood control. But the agency has recently prioritized the removal of non-native species due to lack of funding, the site notes. \"They probably would just talk to him and explain rather than prosecute anything, or they might just go in and take it away,\" said Felicia Marcus, a fellow at Stanford University's Water in the West program and a former head of the city of Los Angeles' public works department. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Rosenberg says he understands the consequences. \"If they throw a book at me, it'll be quite a big book, but I'm at the point where that's less urgent to me than making art that obviously deserves to get made,\" he said. Guerrillas lay the groundwork to rewrite the rules Artists have long exploited that legal gray area around what's considered public land. Historically, it was the late  Lewis MacAdams , a poet and activist, whose guerrilla tactics expanded public access to the LA River. In 1985, MacAdams and friends cut open a fence blocking its entry and declared the river open to the people. Through Friends of the LA River, the advocacy group he founded, MacAdams made sure the city wouldn't forget the river that birthed it. He promoted it as a resource  that people should protect, restore and enjoy . During a  meeting with the county , as MacAdams told it, whenever the head of the public works department referred to the waterway as a \"flood control channel,\" he would shoot back with \"river.\" In 2008, kayakers carried the baton,  when writer George Wolfe  led a scofflaw fleet of paddlers down the entire waterway to prove that it was \"navigable waters\" so it could keep its Clean Water Act protections. Two years later, the Environmental Protection Agency agreed with what MacAdams had started and designated the river as navigable. \"He didn't know jack doodle scratch about the river or river ecosystems at that time. He led with his artistic passion,\" Superfisky said. \"But then, my golly, he is the one guy that really got us to start calling it a river again.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Superfisky says Rosenberg is having his \"Lewis MacAdams moment.\" Knowing his wetland experiment could wash away in an instant, Rosenberg said he feels there's some wiggle room to experiment and make mistakes. Rosenberg acknowledges the dangers that can spring from an uneducated approach. \"I wouldn't push back on someone calling it reckless, to be honest,\" he said. But he's more focused on the good he says can come from \"vigorous action.\" He says that, among his millennial peers and younger generations, \"a sense of attainability and agency\" is lacking when it comes to helping chip away at big-picture issues like climate change. He's aware that there are legal avenues available to produce ecological art. He appreciates that artist Lauren Bon, for example, has secured  more than 70 permits  as part of an ongoing  project  to divert water from the river that could irrigate a state park nearby. But Rosenberg thinks there's room for some freewheeling. \"Maybe it's not about waiting for permits or even about waiting to feel like you've mastered the material,\" he said. \"There's a long history in ecological actions of perfect being an argument against the good happening at all.\" Nature bats last On a recent Saturday evening, during one of his public tours, Rosenberg handed out scythes and an agenda to whack away the invasive plants. Allie Baron, a lifelong LA resident, brought her two sons with her after reaching out to Rosenberg on Instagram. As she gleefully tore out a creeping primrose, the 36-year-old said, \"All I can do is try to make my community better and make the river pretty. You do what you can to try to restore life to things that need help.\" Caught in the wetland brush was a blue rubber bullet —  just like the ones LAPD officers had deployed  during the anti-ICE protests held in downtown LA this summer, over immigration raids. \"One of the cool things about a structure like this is that it's trapping that stuff,\" Rosenberg said. \"The rubber bullet was here and not in the ocean yet.\" That and some oily sheen on the watery patch of willows were another reminder of the intensely urban environment. Later, the guerrilla group witnessed a hawk snatch its dinner from the water. A few days after that, the forecast from river pundits proved accurate. It rained, filling the channel with a fast-moving current. \"The garden is gone,\" Rosenberg said. He says he'll start gardening again in the spring. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Nov. 17th, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story incorrectly said that planting a front-yard vegetable garden in Florida was an example of guerilla gardening and a violation of state law. In fact, the woman whose experience was being referenced removed her garden after learning about a local zoning ordinance banning such gardens. After she took the issue to court, the state passed a law nullifying local bans on vegetable gardens on residential properties. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97836","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Justice Department Official Told Prosecutors That U.S. Should 'Just Sink' Drug Boats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In February 2025, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove made controversial remarks at a Justice Department conference, suggesting the U.S. should 'just sink' suspected drug boats, signaling a dramatic shift from decades of traditional maritime interdiction.

U.S. should 'just sink' drug boats \n         By Ryan Lucas \n        \n           Monday, November 17, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         At a Justice Department conference in February, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told the department's top drug prosecutors that the Trump administration wasn't interested in interdicting  suspected drug vessels  at sea anymore. Instead, he said, the U.S. should \"just sink the boats,\" according to three people present for the speech. At the time of Bove's comments, President Trump had only been back in office for a month. The White House had made clear that combatting drug cartels and transnational criminal gangs was a priority, but few could envision that six months later the U.S. would be blowing up suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean. Since the first deadly attack on what the government says was a narco-trafficking vessel off the Venezuelan coast on Sept. 2, the U.S. has conducted some 20 strikes in international waters, killing more than 75 people. The administration says the boats were carrying drugs and posed a direct threat to the United States, but it has not provided any public evidence to support those assertions. Bove's remarks, which have not previously been publicly reported, suggest at least some members of the administration were considering this policy shift as early as six months before the boat strikes began. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       NPR spoke about the Trump administration's policies with nine current and former U.S. officials who worked to combat transnational crime. They described a dramatic policy shift, from interdicting suspected drug boats, seizing the drugs, detaining and often prosecuting the crew, as the U.S. has done for decades — to blasting them out of the water and killing those on board. All of the individuals spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. They questioned the legality of the deadly strikes — many referred to them as murder — and expressed doubts that the new policy would be more effective at stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the United States. Several of them said it may ultimately prove counterproductive. \"There's an awful lot of frustration with the administration abandoning what has been one of the most effective ways of going after organized crime in favor of things that sound macho but get you nowhere,\" said one former DOJ official who worked on maritime interdictions. \"The most devastating thing is killing people on the high seas without any due process or evidence of violence. Just preemptive strikes.\" In a statement, a Justice Department spokesperson said that the department \"along with the entire Trump Administration is committed to ending the illegal trafficking of deadly drugs into our country and leaks from disgruntled former employees will not distract us from our mission.\" 'Jaw-dropping' comments about sinking boats More than six months before the strikes began, Bove addressed a conference for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, known as OCDETF, at the Justice Department's National Advocacy Center on the University of South Carolina campus.  More than 100 people were in the audience for Bove's closing speech. Among them were the leaders of OCDETF's 19 strike forces, including the three that focus on intercepting drug shipments at sea. These task forces played the leading role in U.S. government efforts to combat transnational organized crime and illicit narcotics. Speaking via video teleconference, Bove expressed skepticism about maritime interdictions and the value of prosecuting low-level drug runners caught at sea.  \"That's when he said that we're not going to worry so much about interdictions, we're just going to sink the boats,\" said one of the attendees. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I looked around at others in that room when he said that, and jaws literally dropped,\" this person said. \"The way people interpreted that was not, 'We're going to interdict and process the folks in the boats.' People took that as, 'We're just going to blow up the boats with people in them.'\" Two other attendees said that at the time it was unclear to them whether Bove meant to sink the boats after seizing the drugs and arresting the crew — as the U.S. Coast Guard traditionally does — or sinking them with the crew and drugs still on board. \"It seemed so outlandish I didn't take it seriously. It just didn't seem reasonable until they started blowing boats up, and then holy s—-, does this all go together?\" said one former senior DOJ official who was in the room. \"Now that you look back on it, I think you can infer he probably meant just sink the boats with the people on them.\" A fourth person who was at the conference recalled Bove's comments about ending interdictions but did not remember his remarks about sinking drug boats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Bove declined to comment for this story.  It is unclear to what extent he was directly involved in administration discussions about military action against narcotraffickers, or the Justice Department's still-secret legal memo drafted over the summer justifying the strikes. Bove left the DOJ after being confirmed by the Senate to serve as a federal judge — a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit — in late July, and he received his commission on Aug. 20. Justice memo justifies strikes' legality The Trump administration's first lethal strike on a suspected drug boat took place the first week of September in the Caribbean. It expanded strikes in October to the Eastern Pacific as well, and it now has carried out a total of some 20 strikes combined. Administration officials say the goal of the lethal campaign is to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, although the significant increase in U.S. military troops, ships and aircraft in the Caribbean has fueled speculation that White House's real aim is to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The recent arrival of the carrier USS Gerald Ford and its strike group in the Caribbean has significantly added to American firepower in the region and heightened expectations the U.S. could strike Venezuela. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has yet to provide any evidence to the American public to support its assertions that the boats that have been blown up at sea are indeed carrying drugs or that the individuals on board are cartel members. It also has not provided a full public accounting of its legal justification for hitting boats other than that the president is taking action in self-defense and under his Article II powers as commander-in-chief. Early this month — after being pressed for weeks by lawmakers — administration officials provided select members of Congress a more detailed briefing on the legal rationale, including the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel memo on the strikes, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. The memo concludes that the U.S. is in a non-international armed conflict with the cartels, and that the strikes are being conducted in line with the laws of war. The head of the OLC also told lawmakers the administration wasn't going to seek an extension of war powers because the administration has determined they don't apply, since the American personnel conducting the strikes aren't in danger. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"A self-licking ice cream cone\" The administration's lethal approach marks a huge shift from the traditional maritime interdictions the U.S. has long done.  Those operations involve the U.S. Coast Guard intercepting a drug boat at sea, boarding the vessel, seizing the narcotics, arresting the crew and bringing them back to the U.S. to face prosecution. The U.S. Coast Guard works off information gathered from U.S. law enforcement and intelligence community sources. The U.S. military, meanwhile, has a hand in detection, monitoring and coordination. \"We used to call it a self-licking ice cream cone,\" said one former FBI official who worked transnational crime and maritime interdictions. \"You stop a boat, you get the bad guys, you use the leverage of prosecuting them to turn them into cooperators.\" Investigators would use those cooperators to intercept more drug boats, arrest more low-level traffickers, leverage some of them into cooperators to get more intelligence. This way, over time, the former FBI official said, investigators have been able to work their way up to cartel leadership. Even when the people detained on a boat didn't have information that helped in a prosecution, they often had tidbits that helped illuminate the cartel network, which American officials then use for intelligence purposes. \"Forgetting the philosophy of whether killing people is right or wrong, when you kill them you can't talk to them. When you grab them, you can,\" one former senior DOJ official said. The information that leads to an interdiction comes from human sources as well as what's known as signals intelligence, or electronic surveillance. Current and former officials said in interviews that that information is generally accurate and reliable. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It allows the Coast Guard, for example, to put a cutter at a precise location of a drug boat in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, which is roughly the size of the continental United States. The current and former officials said the intelligence isn't always 100% accurate. Sometimes the vessel the Coast Guard intercepts is a resupply boat carrying food and fuel for the traffickers, not the actual drugs. Still, the intelligence that allows the Coast Guard to be in the right place is often built upon a piece of information provided by a human source, which then allows the U.S. government to put its vast electronic spying powers to good use. These officials said blowing up boats instead of interdicting them will have a compound effect over time on the quality of intelligence. With the lethal strikes, the U.S. is no longer gathering phones and other electronics off of crew arrested on the high seas, nor is the U.S. questioning the low-level drug runners about who and what they know about the broader trafficking network. \"You need something to tell you where to look,\" the former DOJ official said. \"If you're killing all these people, you just dried up the human intelligence.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Limits to understanding cartels As the intelligence dwindles, the U.S. government's understanding of the cartels, their money laundering networks, supply chains and business strategies will start to go dark.  In the past, the OCDETF-led interdiction model intercepted around 4% to 6% of known maritime cocaine shipments annually on non-commercial vessels. In fiscal year 2023, for example, the rate was 3.71%, according to a Department of Homeland Security  watchdog report  from February. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This fall, the Trump administration  shuttered OCDETF , and transferred its cases to new Homeland Security Task Forces jointly run by the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations.  For those who spent years working on combating drug cartels, there's deep skepticism that the Trump administration's new policy of military strikes will be prevent more drugs from reaching America. \"All this strategy is doing is killing people and the same amount of drugs is getting into the U.S.,\" the former senior DOJ official said. \"You didn't save anybody or increase the number of people you're saving in the U.S. It's extraordinarily shortsighted and I don't think it gets you the goal you want.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5508871","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:38:00-11:17","title":"Trump Makes a U-Turn on the Epstein Files: A Timeline of His Shifting Stance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has reversed his long-standing position of refusing to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, now urging House Republicans to vote to disclose the documents.

Here's a timeline of his shifting stance \n         By Rachel Treisman, Bill Chappell \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 2:38 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In a major about-face, President Trump has called on House Republicans to vote to release the files of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after months of refusing to do so and mounting pressure from Republicans and Democrats alike. Epstein was found dead in 2019 in the Manhattan facility where he was being held on charges that he  operated a sex-trafficking ring  preying on young women and underage girls. Officials later concluded he died by suicide. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But public skepticism about his death — and allegations that his wealthy, powerful network helped facilitate and cover up his crimes — persist, dogging the Trump administration in particular. The names of a number of powerful figures have appeared in already-released documents related to Epstein's case, including Trump and former President Bill Clinton, both of whom socialized with Epstein. Appearing in Epstein's flight logs and other records, however, is not an indication of wrongdoing. Trump has long resisted the release of additional files from the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, despite promising on the campaign trail that he would do so if reelected. That unfulfilled promise has been the center of growing public controversy, conspiracy theories and pressure from Congress in the months since he took office. Prominent Republicans from House Speaker Mike Johnson to former Vice President Mike Pence have called for more transparency on the Epstein case, along with influential right-wing conspiracy promoters, including media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And Democrats on the House Oversight Committee continue to apply pressure by subpoenaing and releasing thousands of pages of records from the Justice Department, many of which spotlight Epstein's onetime friendship with Trump. The White House has consistently downplayed that relationship — which Trump says ended before Epstein was indicted for soliciting prostitution in 2006 — and dismissed the controversy as a hoax pushed by Democrats. But after months of opposing the files' release, Trump  said on Sunday  that \"we have nothing to hide\" and that it was time to move on from what he says is a \"Democrat hoax … to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party.\" A House vote is expected on Tuesday, but it would be just the first step in a longer process. The House and Senate would both need to vote to release the unclassified files in order for the matter to reach his desk for a signature. Here's a timeline of the Trump administration's shifting tone and actions on the Epstein case. Feb. 21:  Attorney General Pam Bondi says the Epstein client list is \"sitting on my desk\" in an appearance  on Fox News , in response to a question from John Roberts. \"The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients? Will that really happen?\" Roberts asks Bondi. \"It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that,\" the attorney general replies. Bondi later says she was referring to the Epstein files, not a client list. But her remark has echoed through discussions of the Epstein story so far this year. Feb. 27:  The White House gives  binders to far-right influencers  bearing a Department of Justice seal and labels reading, \"Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified.\" But much of the information turns out to have been released before, and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, chairwoman of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets,  calls it \"old info.\" July 7:  The Justice Department  releases a memo  saying it has found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" for Epstein, contradicting Bondi's February statement. The agency says it turned up more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence. It also states that \"Epstein harmed over one thousand victims.\" But the DOJ says those victims' sensitive information is \"intertwined\" in the materials and it concludes \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The memo  addresses several hot topics on social media. In addition to rebutting the notion of a client list, it says there's no credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures or that his death was anything other than a case of suicide. July 12:  \"We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening,\" Trump  says on Truth Social  in response to his supporters' criticisms of Bondi. The president accuses critics of trying to hurt his administration, \"all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.\" People should let Bondi do her job, Trump says, \"and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\" July 15:  Bondi  refuses to address questions  about her handling of the Epstein files. Trump voices his support, saying his attorney general has \"really done a very good job.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump also suggests people who are fixated on Epstein should move on: \"He's dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is, I really don't. And the credible information's been given.\" July 16:  Trump  lashes out at fellow Republicans  for fixating on Epstein, calling it a hoax. \"It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats' work,\" Trump tells reporters in the Oval Office. Trump also  suggests he would approve  of Bondi releasing some Epstein documents if they meet a standard: \"Whatever's credible, she can release. If a document is credible, if a document's there that is credible, she can release.\" As NPR's Dominico Montanaro  later reports , it's one of many instances of Trump emphasizing that \"credible evidence\" from the Epstein records should be shared. July 17:  Trump  slams  The Wall Street Journal  after the  paper publishes what it says  is a risqué birthday note Trump wrote to celebrate Epstein's 50th birthday, stating, \"the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE.\" \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" Trump  writes on Truth Social . July 18:  Trump files a  defamation lawsuit against  The Wall Street Journal   over its coverage of his relationship with Epstein, including the birthday note that Trump says he didn't write. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the same day, the DOJ  files a motion in the Southern District of New York  to unseal grand jury testimony related to Epstein's 2019 indictment charging him with sex trafficking offenses, citing \"extensive public interest\" following the agency's July 6 memo. The DOJ later asks to unseal related exhibits, including a PowerPoint presentation and four pages of call logs. The agency files similar motions in New York regarding the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime partner who was sentenced to a 20-year prison term, as well as in Florida, where Epstein  agreed to a plea deal  with U.S. prosecutors in 2007 over the abuse of minor girls. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       July 19:  Trump  posts on Truth Social  about his administration's grand jury request, saying he \"asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.\" July 22:  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche  says he is talking with Maxwell's   lawyer  and expects to meet with her, at Bondi's direction. Trump  says he thinks the plan  \"sounds appropriate.\" July 23:  The Wall Street Journal  reports  that Bondi and other Justice Department officials told Trump in May that his name \"is among many in the Epstein files.\" The newspaper says the officials feel the files contain \"unverified hearsay\" about hundreds of people, including Trump, who were in the same social orbit as Epstein. The same day, federal judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida  denies release  of grand jury transcripts related to Epstein. July 24:  Blanche meets with Maxwell in prison for two days, according to  Democratic senators . The DOJ says it's mulling whether to release transcripts of their meeting. July 29:  Trump says he and Epstein  had a falling out  over Epstein hiring girls from his Mar-a-Lago resort, resulting in Epstein being kicked out. A prominent Epstein accuser, the late Virginia Giuffre,  had said  she was a teenager working at Mar-a-Lago when she first met Maxwell and Epstein. Aug. 1 : The Bureau of Prisons says it has moved Maxwell from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Fla., to a women's minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas. Aug. 5:  The House Oversight Committee  subpoenas the Department of Justice  for records related to Epstein and Maxwell. It seeks \"all documents and communications relating or referring to\" the pair and their respective court cases, setting a deadline of Aug. 19. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Aug. 11:  Federal judge Paul Engelmayer in New York  denies Bondi's request  to unseal grand jury materials from the Maxwell case, saying most of the records are already public. In a rebuke to the DOJ, the judge adds that an observer \"might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.\" Aug. 18:  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky.,  says the DOJ will send the first batch  of Epstein documents to the panel on Aug. 22, three days after the committee's original deadline. \"It will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,\" Comer says. Aug. 20:  Federal judge Richard M. Berman denies Bondi's request to unseal records related to the Epstein case in New York, citing longstanding precedents of keeping grand jury proceedings secret and stating that the government did not prove \"special circumstances\" that might justify unsealing the records. Aug. 22:  The House Oversight Committee  receives the first batch  of thousands of Epstein-related files from the Justice Department's investigation, some of which it says will eventually become public. Sept. 8:  House Democrats release a copy of Epstein's 50th birthday book with notes from friends and associates, including the tawdry note — framed by a hand-drawn outline of a woman's body —  that appears to bear Trump's signature , despite his denial in July. The White House again dismisses that claim, calling it \"FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sept. 23:  A  statue of Epstein and Trump skipping  hand-in-hand, above a satirical plaque honoring their friendship, appears on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson tells NPR that \"it's not news that Epstein knew Donald Trump, because Donald Trump kicked Epstein out of his club for being a creep.\" U.S. Park Police abruptly removed the statue for what the Department of Interior later said was permit noncompliance. The protest group behind the bronze installation has since displayed it two more times,  on the Mall in October  and  in front of a D.C. restaurant  in November. Oct. 6:  On the same day that the Supreme Court declines to hear Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, Trump leaves the door open to potentially granting her a pardon — which he  previously told reporters  he was \"allowed\" to do. \"I haven't heard the name in so long. I can say that, that I'd have to take a look at it,\"  Trump said . \"I will speak to the DOJ.\" Nov. 12:  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rules out a Trump pardon of Maxwell,  telling reporters , \"It's not something he's talking about or even thinking about at this moment in time.\" That same day, the federal government reopens after a record 43-day shutdown. The House returns to session to swear in Democratic  Rep. Adelita Grijalva  of New Mexico, seven weeks after she won a special election to succeed her late father. Grijalva had promised to support forcing a vote on the Epstein files' release, and became the decisive final signature that same day. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee release  three new emails  from Epstein's estate that specifically mention Trump. In one from 2011, Epstein referred to Trump as \"the dog that hasn't barked\" and says he spent \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex trafficking victims. The White House downplays the emails, with Leavitt saying they were \"selectively leaked\" and \"prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.\" Later that day, Republicans release another 20,000 documents, which include emails from Epstein expressing displeasure with Trump and his presidency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Nov. 14:  At Trump's public urging,  Bondi confirms  that the Justice Department will investigate Epstein's alleged \"involvement and relationship\" with banks and several prominent Democrats, including Clinton. That same day, Trump  withdraws his support  of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a longtime ally of the president who publicly broke with him over the Epstein issue. She was one of three Republican women to sign the petition to force a vote on the files' release. Another, Rep.

A tale of $399 couches and tariffs \n         By Alina Selyukh \n        \n           Friday, November 7, 2025 • 5:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Furniture How has the price changed since before the pandemic? The price of bedroom furniture rose 11% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rose 25%. Why has the price gone up?  Like all industries, furniture makers and sellers are dealing with higher expenses: utilities, insurance, wages. Big cost spikes came during the pandemic, when shoppers  raced to buy  desks for home offices and patio sets, and  shipping costs soared . But if you ask furniture industry insiders, the first thing they'll reply is that the price of furniture has actually grown slower than overall inflation, which has risen nearly 26% since February 2020.  Then, the experts will note that prices are down from their peak in 2022. And then — like David Koehler did — they'll deliver the popular adage: \"You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you could still buy a $399 sofa today,\" says Koehler, who runs the Delaware chain Johnny Janosik Furniture. Of course, not everyone wants a $399 sofa, but the fact that it still exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items, like cars or appliances. Overseas competition has kept prices lower  Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass market furniture feel intense pressure to keep prices down. \"The barriers to entry are very, very low, and the furniture business is incredibly fragmented,\" says Bill McLoughlin, editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication. Besides, furniture sellers compete not just with second-hand goods, but with any expensive plans you may have, say, for a trip or home repairs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And the race for cheapest prices has moved a lot of the industry abroad. \"Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years,\" says McLoughlin. \"Because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product.\" American wages tend to be a lot higher than those overseas, on top of the bigger costs of U.S. environmental standards. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or  North Carolina , many components — fabrics, handles and electronics, like the power button for your recliner — still ship from abroad, mainly China. Enter: tariffs  During his first term, President Trump's tariffs made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out — though not to America, but to Vietnam. This year, Trump raised tariffs on imports from almost all countries. And he's set  new double-digit tariffs specifically  for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture. The furniture giant Ashley Furniture in June  raised the price  of the majority of its products as a result of tariffs. The Home Furnishings Association, an industry trade group, has warned of cumulative cost increases for both retailers and shoppers. What are people doing about it? As importing furniture becomes pricier, American-made furniture may start looking more attractive in comparison. But seller Koehler worries about how shoppers will react. \"The consumer, when we get feedback, they say, 'We would love to buy American,'\" he says. \"But when they vote with their dollars and see, this item is $500 and that item is $1,200, they say, 'I think I can only afford the $500.' So they end up buying an imported item anyway, just because there is such a difference in price.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut: watching their spending rise on other, more critical costs, such as  health insurance , or  car insurance , or  groceries . \"Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture and I'm going, 'I really need to replace that,'\" says Cummins, whose threadbare couches have been well-loved by three dogs and three children. \"I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away.\" Cummins says at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns, and her couches — still standing, even if covered by a blanket — feel more stable than her budget. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   If you own some, let's call it well-loved furniture, you can probably relate to Erin Cummins from Connecticut. ERIN CUMMINS: Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture, and I'm going, I really need to replace that. So I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away. PFEIFFER: NPR has been explaining the forces driving up prices in our series Cost Of Living: The Price We Pay. NPR's Alina Selyukh assembles this piece on furniture. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: For Erin Cummins, the horrors that befell her living room furniture were actually really cute. CUMMINS: They've gone through three dogs and three kids now (laughter), so... SELYUHK: They refers to couches - navy blue, upholstered, now thread-bare - and an ottoman - dark brown, faux leather, now peeling. The dogs were masters of jumping on furniture. CUMMINS: Then we had kids, and it was like, oh, this is worse. So... SELYUHK: Now, every time her mother plans a visit, Cummins runs the search, scanning online stores and, of course, Facebook Marketplace, hoping for just the right price-to-quality ratio. CUMMINS: I'd rather buy something that we like and is well-made than buy a cheap couch that's going to fall apart and I have to replace in two years. SELYUHK: Federal inflation data shows that since before the pandemic, the price of bedroom furniture grew almost 11%. The price of kitchen, dining room and that living room furniture Cummins needs grew 25%. BILL MCLOUGHLIN: Furniture prices are rising because manufacturer costs are rising. SELYUHK: Bill McLoughlin is the editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication. He points to all the usual costs - utilities, insurance, wages. One spike came during the pandemic when shipping costs rose tenfold at one point. MCLOUGHLIN: If you read Furniture Today on a regular basis, you'll notice that we write about a company going out of business almost every week. SELYUHK: Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass-market furniture feel pressure to keep prices down because they are competing not just with your local thrift shop or your family hand-me-downs, but also for the budget you may be saving for a trip or home repairs. And so even though some furniture prices grew 25%, that's actually a little slower than overall inflation. David Koehler, who runs a big Delaware chain Johnny Janosik furniture, delivers a common line in the industry. DAVID KOEHLER: You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you can still buy a $399 sofa today. SELYUHK: Of course not everyone wants this kind of cheap sofa, but the fact that it exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items like cars or appliances. McLoughlin, from Furniture Today, says one reason is because, say, a really basic couch is much simpler to manufacture - plywood, springs, foam, fabric. There's a ton of competitors in furniture, and often they are overseas. MCLOUGHLIN: Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product. SELYUHK: And American labor is not cheap, plus the higher costs of environmental standards here. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or North Carolina, many components still ship from abroad, mainly China, like fabrics, handles or electronics - think a power button for your recliner. And this is where we come to President Trump's tariffs. MCLOUGHLIN: The specific purpose of that tariff is to give American furniture manufacturers a competitive advantage. SELYUHK: During his first term, Trump made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out, but not to the U.S. - to Vietnam. This year, Trump raised tariffs on all imports from almost all countries, and he set new tariffs specifically for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture. This will make imported furniture more expensive, and seller Dave Koehler thinks American-made furniture will look more attractive in comparison. But he worries about how shoppers will react. KOEHLER: But the consumer, you know, when we get feedback, they say, oh, yeah, we would love to buy American. We want to buy American. It's important to me. SELYUHK: But he says, when they realize that U.S.-made might cost double... KOEHLER: So they end up buying an imported item, anyway. SELYUHK: Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut, watching their spending on other more critical costs, like health insurance or groceries. Cummins says, at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns. CUMMINS: Our couches are still standing (laughter), so - and I can throw a blanket over them, and it's working. SELYUHK: For now, her threadbare couches feel more stable than her budget.

Sky-high costs for construction and property insurance now threaten to squeeze out a lot of the family-run hotels that characterized Fort Myers Beach. And there's little hope that the store clerks and bartenders who once lived there will be able to afford it anymore. In their place, a lot of locals expect more big resorts and expensive homes fortified against hurricanes. \"That gentrification is a real thing, the change in the cost is a real thing,\" says Rob Fowler, president of Fowler Construction & Development, a local builder. \"And it all adds up to the fact that only well-heeled players can play now.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The changes unfolding in Fort Myers Beach are an extreme version of what's happening throughout southwest Florida. Older, wealthier people have been  flocking to the region  for  years . That fueled an affordable housing crisis, which was  amplified  by Hurricane Ian. Rising prices for  home and flood insurance  have added to the problem, leaving working- and middle-class families struggling with the costs of living in a disaster-prone area, according to Realtors. The challenges Florida faces, heightened by a warming planet, are playing out nationwide. Home insurance premiums across the United States have been  increasing , in part because climate change contributes to more-intense storms, floods and wildfires that damage and destroy property. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Higher insurance rates can end up affecting entire towns. In southwest Florida, rising insurance costs have started to depress home values, which can drive down property-tax revenue to local governments.

Their workers were leaving the island because older houses were being renovated or torn down, and more expensive dwellings took their place. \"Then, Ian basically hit the fast-forward button on all of that for us,\" Weeks says. The hurricane damaged or destroyed most of the buildings in Fort Myers Beach. Overnight, homeowners and businesses faced a decision: How to rebuild to meet more  stringent state building codes . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then, soon after Ian, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  revised flood maps  for Lee County, where Fort Myers Beach is located. Most coastal properties were reclassified into higher-hazard flood zones, says Fowler, the local builder. That meant rebuilding would have to meet tougher federal standards, too, like elevating structures above expected flood levels. Taken together, the stricter state and federal standards have added to the town's affordability problems. \"There's good to it,\" Fowler says. \"The stuff we build today is going to be that much more resilient than what we had before. The problem is it just costs a lot of money, and it takes a lot of time.\" Liszak, the chamber of commerce leader, says rebuilding her five-room hotel, The Sea Gypsy Inn, would have cost as much as $4 million after Hurricane Ian. \"The numbers don't work,\" she says, adding: \"All of the boutique hotels that are on the island that were washed away, they're all in that same boat.\" Realtors warn foreclosures are looming Hurricane Ian also added fuel to Florida's home-insurance crisis, and that's making housing even more expensive. Karen Rodriguez, an executive at Habitat for Humanity of Lee and Hendry Counties, says home insurance quotes more than doubled after the storm. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The average cost of homeowners insurance in Florida this year is more than $5,700, according to  Bankrate . That's more than any state except Nebraska and Louisiana, and about $3,350 above the national average. Flood insurance is another big expense. Along Florida's coasts, many people live in high-risk flood zones where mortgage lenders require  flood coverage . Most people who have  flood insurance  buy it through FEMA's  National Flood Insurance Program . Several years ago, FEMA began overhauling how the flood program sets its prices to better reflect risk at individual properties. As a result, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some places. Several miles inland from Fort Myers Beach, Jessica Gatewood is seeing the impact of rising insurance costs in her real estate business. One of Gatewood's clients recently sold her house after the cost of home and flood insurance climbed to about $10,000 a year. The house filled up with about 5 feet of water during Hurricane Ian. After it was repaired, the house took on several inches of water again last year during hurricanes Milton and Helene. Gatewood says her client was only able to sell after she spent about $20,000 on flood gates, which can rise automatically to block water from getting into buildings. \"That whole neighborhood, which probably has 200 homes, everybody's in the same boat,\" Gatewood says. With so many homeowners trying to escape crushing insurance bills and the perennial threat of disaster, Gatewood says home sales in the area have slowed. In Lee County in October, the median length of time that homes were on the market was 87 days, a 26% increase from a year earlier,  according to Redfin , a real estate website. That leaves homeowners with unaffordable insurance in a precarious spot. \"Right now, the majority of what I see is that they're pinching every penny to pay that mortgage every month,\" Gatewood says. \"If this economy continues on like it is for another year, yeah, for sure, we're going to have a lot of foreclosures.\" While homeowners scrape by, the value of a lot of their houses is falling. In October, the average home value in Lee County was down more than 10% from a year earlier and more than 16% lower than in August 2022, the month before Hurricane Ian hit, according to the real estate website  Zillow . Rising insurance costs seem to be driving the decline in home values, says Weeks of Florida Gulf Coast University. \"Little by little, you're going to see everybody going away\" Renters are getting pinched, too, as landlords pass along some of the increased costs they're paying for property insurance. Melyssa Caballero moved to Lee County in 2022 when she was priced out of Miami. Since then, rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband has more than doubled. Unable to save, Caballero says she's thinking of leaving Florida after watching her niece move away a couple of years ago and find cheaper housing in Ohio. \"Little by little, you're going to see everybody going away,\" says Caballero, the office administrator at a church in Fort Myers, about 13 miles northeast of Fort Myers Beach. \"Anybody that doesn't have that money — enough to be able to pay rent — people are going to have to move.\" In its latest migration  report , the Florida Chamber of Commerce said almost 511,000 people moved out of the state in 2023, the most ever. About a quarter of those who left were between the ages of 20 and 29 — young workers who are critical for a growing economy. High housing costs were  the main reason  people moved away, the chamber said. Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an industry group, says Florida was plagued in recent years by \"legal system abuse\" as homeowners and contractors tried to make insurers replace functioning roofs after storms. Insurers have faced similar cases of what Gordon describes as \"fraud\" in  other states , which he says has contributed to rising costs. After Florida lawmakers  took steps to limit  insurance litigation, the average rate for homeowners insurance in the state rose by 1% this year — the smallest increase nationwide, Gordon says. But the underlying risks are still there. \"We've seen more people moving into coastal [areas], building bigger, more expensive buildings. We've seen the climate severity increase,\" Gordon says. \"So all of those are going to add to the insurance costs.\" Racing to rebuild before the next storm At Fort Myers Beach in October, Dixie Fish Co. was packed at dinnertime. Another restaurant bustled with staff preparing to reopen. Construction workers pulled apart a crumbling building. As the sun set, people lounged on the beach, some perched on pilings of the town's broken pier. A couple danced in a plaza nearby. \"I still think that this island is going to come back,\" says Scott Safford, a town councilman who's married to Jacki Liszak, the head of the chamber of commerce. \"And the guys that are investing now, that are stakeholders now, are going to reap the rewards.\" Still, a lot of Safford's friends have given up and moved inland, or back to North Carolina or Wisconsin or wherever home was before. He worries the mom-and-pop businesses won't come back, and that more national chain brands will move in, like Starbucks and the Margaritaville resort that opened a couple of years ago with hundreds of guest rooms. Safford knows, though, that the town needs investment. \"I'm worried about our financial feasibility long term,\" Safford says, leaning back in a chair at his vacation rental company. The sign that used to hang at The Sea Gypsy Inn is propped against a wall. \"We're going to need development to sustain the tax base.\" The town also needs some luck with the weather. At a waterfront restaurant, Liszak says she's scared another big storm will come before they're ready. \"That will chase away all the investors, that will chase away the people who do want to come and live here for their little piece of paradise,\" Liszak says. \"And that will economically set us back another five to 10 years.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   When communities rebuild after a disaster, they can sometimes be out of reach financially for the people who lived there before. Parts of Florida, for example, are still recovering three years after Hurricane Ian swept across the state, and residents are finding that rising home insurance costs are making it more expensive to live in harm's way. NPR's Michael Copley has more. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER SPLASHING) MICHAEL COPLEY, BYLINE: Jacki Liszak owned a little yellow hotel, steps from the water in Fort Myers Beach. When Hurricane Ian slammed into the barrier island in 2022, the storm washed away the Sea Gypsy Inn. The business is just a memory now. Between rising insurance costs and tougher construction codes, Liszak says rebuilding doesn't make financial sense. JACKI LISZAK: All of the boutique hotels that are on the island that were washed away, they're all in that same boat. COPLEY: Liszak runs the Fort Myers Beach Chamber of Commerce. She says the storm also drove away longtime homeowners, and there's little hope the store clerks and bartenders who once lived on the island will be able to afford to anymore. In their place, a lot of locals expect more big resorts and expensive homes built to handle punishing weather. ROB FOWLER: That gentrification is a real thing. The change in the cost is a real thing. COPLEY: That's Rob Fowler, a local builder. FOWLER: And it all adds up to the fact that, you know, only well-heeled players can play now. COPLEY: The changes unfolding in Fort Myers Beach are an extreme version of what's happening throughout southwest Florida. The region already had a shortage of affordable housing when Hurricane Ian hit. Rising prices for home and flood insurance have added to the problem, leaving a lot of homeowners struggling to get by. It's a problem that's also facing other communities around the U.S. Home insurance costs are going up nationwide, partly because climate change is contributing to more extreme weather that damages and destroys property. (SOUNDBITE OF BUILDING MATERIALS CRASHING) COPLEY: In downtown Fort Myers, several miles inland from Fort Myers Beach, Jessica Gatewood is seeing the impact in her real estate business. JESSICA GATEWOOD: Right now, majority of what I see is that they're pinching every penny to pay that mortgage every month. COPLEY: With lots of homeowners trying to escape crushing insurance bills, Gatewood says home sales have slowed and home values are falling. GATEWOOD: If this economy continues on like it is for another year, yeah, for sure we're going to have a lot of foreclosures. COPLEY: Renters are getting squeezed, too. Melyssa Caballero says rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband has doubled since they moved to southwest Florida a few years ago. Now she's thinking of leaving Florida, after watching her niece move away and find cheaper housing in Ohio. MELYSSA CABALLERO: Little by little you can see everybody going away. Anybody that don't have that money - enough to be able to pay rent - people are going to have to move. (SOUNDBITE OF NAIL GUN FIRING) COPLEY: Back in Fort Myers Beach in October, nail guns echoed along the island's main road, where new houses and businesses were going up next to vacant lots and the shells of buildings still gutted by the storm. In the evening, Dixie Fish Company was packed with diners. People lounged on the beach as the sun set. Some sat on pilings of the town's broken pier. A couple danced in the plaza nearby. Scott Safford says the town's going to make a comeback. SCOTT SAFFORD: And the guys that are investing now, that are stakeholders now, are going to reap the rewards. It's just taking longer than we ever expected. COPLEY: Safford's a town councilman in Fort Myers Beach. He's also married to Jacki Liszak, the head of the Chamber of Commerce. He worries national chain brands will replace a lot of the mom-and-pop businesses that characterize the island. But Safford knows the town needs more investment to survive. SAFFORD: We're going to need development to sustain the tax base. COPLEY: Fort Myers Beach also needs some luck with the weather. When Liszak thinks about the rebuilding that's still left to do, she's afraid that another big storm will come before the town's ready. LISZAK: That will chase away all the investors. That will chase away the people who do want to come and live here for their little piece of paradise. COPLEY: And she says that would set the town's recovery back by years. Michael Copley, NPR News.

of the U.S. They're also increasingly unaffordable \n         By Camila Domonoske \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 4:43 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Car ownership How have prices changed since before the pandemic? The cost of owning a car is up 40.59% since January 2020, according to  an index  from Navy Federal Credit Union. That index tracks the cost of new and used cars, repairs and maintenance, insurance, tires, accessories, gasoline, parking, and registration and licensing fees. Why have the prices gone up? From 2000 to 2020, the cost of car ownership rose roughly in line with inflation, according to Navy Federal Credit Union's data. But starting in the pandemic, it far outstripped the cost of living overall. Partly, that reflects the soaring cost of vehicles. Pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions led to a  chip shortage  several years ago,  reducing the supply of new vehicles  and prompting automakers to focus on their  most expensive, highest-margin vehicles . The average new car now costs more than $50,000 — a record — according to Kelley Blue Book. The soaring price of new cars raised demand for  used  cars, pushing the prices for them up, too; on average, used vehicles now run more than $25,000. Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the car buying site Edmunds, points out that today's cars are  nicer  than they used to be. \"It's not as if you're getting the exact same thing just at a higher cost, like a gallon of milk or eggs,\" she says. Instead, new car purchasers \"are buying something that is bigger, that is nicer, that's more refined, probably has more features in it.\" But the downside is that budget options are getting harder to find — and for people on a tight budget, that makes it harder to afford a car. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And it's not just upfront prices that sting. \"If you look at the past five years, there's something that keeps spiking every year,\" says Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"First it was gas prices; after Russia invaded Ukraine, we all remember the $5 gas price.\" And then in 2023 and 2024, she continues, \" car insurance really surged , adding hundreds of dollars a year for many Americans.\" More recently, she says,  maintenance and repair costs  have soared. Tariffs play a role; so does higher demand for parts, as people keep their cars longer to delay the cost of replacing them. The result is that even though gasoline is now relatively cheap — the national average is just over $3 a gallon — the overall cost of car ownership is painfully higher than it used to be. What are people doing about it? Some people are taking on more debt to buy a car — a growing number of Americans owe more on their vehicles than they're worth, Edmunds data shows. Car loans keep getting bigger: More than 19% of all new car loans have monthly payments of $1,000 or more. Long says that Navy Federal Credit Union has seen a new increase in people seeking personal loans to cover the taxes on their vehicles, a sign of strain. Nationally, auto delinquencies are  jumping , another sign. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many people are keeping their existing cars longer, preferring to repair an older vehicle rather than spring for a new one. (Springing for the repairs is tough enough.) Or they're making do with fewer cars. Claudia Pineda, a real estate agent in El Paso, Texas, lives with her four children — three 20-somethings and one teenager. Their household has two cars, and Pineda needs one of them every day — her job requires a lot of driving.  But the kids also need a way to get to work. That means that Pineda's \"mom car,\" a 2015 Nissan Rogue, puts in a lot of miles carting young adults to and from their jobs. It's not ideal. \"I feel like an Uber driver who is very underpaid right now,\" Pineda says. And her kids put in a lot of time waiting around for her when their shifts are done. But when she priced out the cost of a modest used vehicle, it was simply too expensive. \"It takes a big chunk out of your income when you have to pay that much for a vehicle,\" she says. \"And that's just the vehicle. I think about the insurance and the maintenance and the gas. So it adds up.\" Pineda is determined to find a silver lining to the situation. She appreciates the time with her kids, and likes trading music across their generational divide — she tries to keep an open mind about their music, and her Gen Z children are learning the words to '90s R&B hits. \"We're doing okay,\" she says. \"Everything is getting paid.\" But buying a vehicle \"feels like it's a luxury at this point, it really does.\" Will Americans rethink their love of cars?  Cars carry other costs — but they're often invisible. \"You have your health care costs, which you might not realize are car-related,\" says Sarah Goodyear, the co-host of the cheekily named \"War On Cars\" podcast and the co-author of the new book  Life After Cars.  \"If you have high blood pressure, you know, the cars in your world might be contributing to that.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tailpipe pollution and car noise are both bad for human health.  Air pollution  is linked to asthma and other respiratory conditions, inflammation and cognitive problems.  Noise pollution  raises the levels of stress hormones and is tied to high blood pressure and heart disease. And of course, time spent driving is time spent sitting, and a sedentary lifestyle is linked to everything from  cancer to dementia . Goodyear cites  a study in Japan  that focused on a town that went from being car-dependent to having a train station, and found that residents' health care costs went down an average of $600 per person after the addition of a transit stop. But there are other costs too — some of them financial, others more intangible. In 2015, one think tank  estimated  that drivers pay hundreds of dollars a year in taxes for roads, on top of what they pay in gas taxes. There's the cost of  time  spent driving. The private dollars that go towards parking lots. The opportunity costs borne by people who  can't  drive and have trouble accessing jobs, education or other activities. Not to mention environmental damage, or the loneliness that's often pervasive in sprawling, car-centric communities. Or lives lost: In 2019, the federal government  calculated  that traffic crashes cost the equivalent of $1,035 for every person in the U.S. — or more than $4,000 per person per year if you count \"quality of life\" costs, like \"physical pain, disability and emotional impacts.\" Those invisible costs are layered on top of the roughly  $12,000 a year  the average U.S. household  consciously  spends on their vehicles. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But so much of America has been designed around cars that it is very difficult to live without them … except in a few pricey places. \"A walkable, bikeable, transit-rich neighborhood like the one I live in in Brooklyn, New York, is a luxury good,\" says Goodyear. \"It is not affordable for the vast number of Americans. And that is just to me criminal, that we have created a built environment where walking is so endangered that you have to be rich to live in a place where it's safe to walk down the street.\" This is a modern American paradox: Cars carry the price tag of a luxury good, but living a car-free life is a different kind of luxury, mostly available only in very expensive zip codes. Goodyear thinks that can change. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's extraordinarily expensive to build and maintain the amount of automobile infrastructure that we're talking about,\" she says. As the price of cars becomes more burdensome, she thinks, more communities could embrace walking, biking or public transit. Heather Long, the economist, is more skeptical. She thinks drivers are more likely to turn toward smaller, cheaper vehicles, or maybe ridesharing. But she doesn't write off the possibility of change entirely, noting that other countries have managed to embrace more modes of transportation. Americans spend, on average,  17% of their household budgets  on transportation, with the vast majority of that going toward cars. In Europe, where public transit is more widely used,  the average is 12.5% . Pineda, in El Paso, says it would be nice to live someplace where her kids could easily take public transit or walk to work. But that's not where they're living now. So they're swapping tunes on their many shared drives … and saving up to someday buy another vehicle. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   The average new car in the United States costs $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. NPR has been exploring how people are coping with inflation in our series, Cost Of Living: The Price We Pay. Now, today, NPR's Camila Domonoske takes a look at the price we all pay for cars, both the obvious and overlooked. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: When you buy a car, you're also signing up to pay for car insurance, maintenance, gasoline. And since 2020, all those costs have soared, one after another. HEATHER LONG: Every year, something seems to go berserk. DOMONOSKE: Heather Long is the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. She's been tracking these costs. Gasoline is actually cheap at the moment, but even so, the total cost of car ownership has outstripped inflation. LONG: I kept waiting for when are things going to level off, and there's been really no relief for car ownership costs. DOMONOSKE: And then there's the hidden cost of cars, paid by drivers and by society. Sarah Goodyear is the co-host of the cheekily named War On Cars podcast and the co-author of the new book, \"Life After Cars,\" which tallies the many different costs. SARAH GOODYEAR: You have your health care costs, which you might not realize are car-related. DOMONOSKE: Tail pipe pollution and car noise hurt our health, but how do you tally how much that costs? Well, Goodyear cites a Japanese study of a town that got a train station, suddenly reducing their reliance on cars. GOODYEAR: And the change was really dramatic. Their health care costs went down by an average of 600 U.S. dollars per year. DOMONOSKE: Other invisible costs include the tax dollars that fund roads, the cost of parking lots. GOODYEAR: The cost of the time that we spend in cars. DOMONOSKE: And the list goes on. But so much of America is designed around cars that it's hard to live without them, except in a few places - pricey places. GOODYEAR: A walkable, bikeable, transit-rich neighborhood, like the one I live in in Brooklyn, New York, is a luxury good. It is not affordable for the vast number of Americans. DOMONOSKE: Goodyear's new book argues that American cities and towns can become less car-centric, especially as more Americans realize how much cars actually cost us all. But for now, cars are essential in most places. So as costs rise, families are keeping old cars longer or taking on more debt to buy a vehicle. Or they're sharing, like Claudia Pineda, who lives in El Paso, where public transit is limited. Pineda lives with three grown kids as well as one teenager. One of her 20-somethings has her own car, but the others rely on Pineda and her mom-car to get to and from work. CLAUDIA PINEDA: I feel like an Uber driver who is very underpaid right now (laughter). DOMONOSKE: She would love to get another vehicle to share, but it's just too expensive, so they make do. But Pineda is determined to find a silver lining in all the time they spend together in the car. PINEDA: Even listening to music, listening to the things my kids listen to and keeping an open mind, hearing them hum some of these oldies that I listen to because they're learning them. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"END OF THE ROAD\") BOYZ II MEN: (Singing) Although we've come... DOMONOSKE: Her Gen Z daughter knows all the words to, \"End Of The Road,\" Boyz II Men, 1992. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"END OF THE ROAD\") BOYZ II MEN: (Singing) Still I can't let go. Can't let go, baby. DOMONOSKE: That makes Pineda smile.

Clinics market what is known as \"baby Botox,\" lower dose treatments administered less frequently than those for midlife adults — perhaps only once or twice a year. Patients share the process in online videos  filmed from injectors' offices , asking for a touch up to blur away any hint of crows feet or 11 lines between the brows. It may seem absurd that anyone so young would be worried about aging. But like putting on sunscreen, patients say their use of Botox is preventive.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A, an injectable neurotoxin derived from the bacterium that causes botulism. Other brand names include Dysport, Xeomin and Jeuveau. When administered in small amounts, the treatments block the nerve signals to the muscle causing it to relax, thereby temporarily reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Attorney Stephanie Moore started getting Dysport when she was 27 to slow the formation of wrinkles around her eyes, which she attributes to her expressive face.  She pays about $460 per visit, and says these thrice-yearly injections are one of her favorite ways to treat herself: \"I feel a lot more confident.\" With Baby Botox, is age just a number? There aren't comprehensive stats on what age groups are getting Botox, but data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons shows that between  2019 and 2022 , the use of injectable neurotoxins grew by more than 70% across all age groups under 70, including Gen Z adults. It is not approved for use in minors, so the youngest someone can get Botox is 18. Demand for other types of aesthetic procedures and surgeries, including cheek implants and fillers, has also jumped since the COVID-19 pandemic. This timing is no coincidence says sociologist Dana Berkowitz, author of the book  Botox Nation: Changing The Face of America . During the pandemic, people's lives migrated to virtual spaces. That included younger people who had this experience at a formative age. They attended high school or college on Zoom during the day, and then logged onto TikTok and Instagram for socialization in the evenings. Berkowitz says by looking at curated images of others far more frequently, inevitably, people were comparing those faces to their own. At the same time, Berkowitz says some celebrities, along with social media influencers, now openly earn income through endorsements of various cosmetic procedures, further normalizing it. While the 20s seem young for Botox,  Dr. Kristy Hamilton , a board-certified plastic surgeon in Houston, says young adults can start to show signs of aging — a lot of it comes down to genetics and sunscreen. \"Sometimes we see people in their mid-20s that have a lot of wrinkles, and that's just life,\" she says. But what's wrong with having wrinkles? Ageless beauty is seen as a \"status symbol\" in today's society, says Berkowitz. Young women she researched told her these treatments show they were able to invest in themselves at a very early age: \"It was like they were part of this elite kind of social club.\" As Berkowitz explores in her book, falling short of society's definition of feminine beauty can incur a professional tax. \"Our ideal femininity is a youthful one,\" she says. Research shows that people who are perceived as beautiful get better treatment, says  David B. Sarwer,  who studies the psychological aspects of appearance and cosmetic procedures at Temple University's College of Public Health. Sarwer points to a robust body of literature on how attractiveness can positively influence one's academic performance, professional advancement and legal outcomes. One study even found that newborns who are seen as more attractive by hospital nursing staff get picked up more frequently. \"It may make some, dare I say, strategic sense for people to say, 'I want to find a way to improve the way that I look,'\" he says. Are there any risks to starting young? Botox was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetic use in 2002. Physicians interviewed for this story note that since then millions have gotten it safely. Reports of dangerous side effects are extremely rare, and typically linked to  counterfeit or mishandled Botox . There are still some risks. For one, it can stop working because your body forms a resistance to it. This can be frustrating for patients, says  Dr. Paul Durand , a Miami-based board-certified plastic surgeon. He hasn't seen any research explaining why this happens, but theorizes that younger people might be at higher risk because of their more robust immune systems. Another concern is that too much Botox at too high a dose over time can cause excessive atrophy, or shrinking of the muscles. Since we lose volume in our faces as we age anyway, a person's face can start to look hollow instead of youthful. Durand says well-trained clinicians can avoid that result by not overdoing it, i.e. not injecting too deep or using too much of the drug. But assessing a clinician's skill level may be difficult for patients.  Any medical doctor, regardless of specialty, can legally administer cosmetic injections without any special training or certification. That includes dentists. Durand and Hamilton both recommend going to a plastic surgeon or dermatologist's office. Though Berkowitz says there are skilled injectors outside these specialties. She recommends that a Botox-curious patient ask friends or family for a referral. Most people who get cosmetic procedures  say they're happy  with the outcome. Sarwer says the patients who are most satisfied are seeking to address discontent with a specific feature — like Moore's desire to soften the lines around her eyes. But the evidence on how these procedures improve self esteem and quality of life are inconclusive, Sarwer says. When cosmetic patients chase an unattainable ideal of beauty due to a mental health condition like body dysmorphic disorder or severe depression, Sarwer says Botox and other procedures don't improve their symptoms.  He explains these patients are, \"better treated by a mental health professional than they would be treated by a plastic surgeon.\" A life-long habit ... and expense Durand turns away patients who want so much Botox that it would essentially freeze their face, blocking their ability to form expressions. \"That looks terrible,\" he says.  But in his experience, a determined enough person will eventually find a clinician to say \"yes,\" given that administering Botox can be a lucrative revenue stream with relatively few overhead costs. Not only do clinician training and skill levels vary, so do prices. Discount treatments are unlikely to yield desired results, as Berkowitz warns. Amateur Botox can result in an obviously treated face. And there's another problem: Once patients start with Botox or a similar injectable, they're unlikely to stop, says Berkowitz: \"You get people in their 20s, you have a lifelong consumer.\" Berkowitz herself is one of those lifelong consumers: She started getting Botox at 32 and now at 47, needs higher doses, paying about $800 per appointment. For someone who starts young, that money — which could add up to tens of thousands of dollars in your 20s and 30s — could be spent paying off student loans, investing for their future, or traveling the world. If you stop getting the injections, the effects wear off and wrinkles reappear. In this way, Botox is addictive, argues Berkowitz, who admits that getting it feels in conflict with her feminist ethics, which aim to decenter appearance. But Hamilton, the Houston plastic surgeon, says for many of her young patients, Botox is simply part of their overall investment in their health and appearance.  \"Gen Z have this very different view on these things,\" she says. \"This is part of their self-care. It's part of their wellness.\" Stephanie Moore in Pittsburgh, says shaping her appearance with Botox makes her happy. She notes that her husband has tattoos, which she thinks are unnecessary and expensive. \"But that's his body and his choice,\" she says. \"And this is my body and my choice.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-saudi-arabia-crown-prince-f35-77edbfa2f257805d43a501cd4808648a","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:30:29Z","title":"Trump Announces F-35 Sale to Saudi Arabia Amid Geopolitical Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced plans to sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, a move that occurs on the eve of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s first visit to the U.S. in over seven years.

The announcement came on the eve of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s highly anticipated Washington visit, his first to the United States in more than seven years. “I will say that that we will be doing that,” Trump said when asked if he would sell the jets to Saudi Arabia. “We’ll be selling F-35s.” The sale of the fighter jets is one of several major deals between the two countries expected to be announced during the visit. Saudi Arabia is expected to announce a multibillion-dollar investment in U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure, and the two countries are will lay out details about new cooperation in the civil nuclear energy sector, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly ahead of the formal announcement. The crown prince had been expected to arrive with a wish list that includes receiving formal assurances from Trump defining the scope of the U.S. military protection for the kingdom and an agreement to buy U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, one of the world’s most advanced aircraft.

Another long-standing concern, which also derailed a potential similar sale to the United Arab Emirates, is that the F-35 technology could be stolen by or somehow transferred to China, which has close ties to both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, according to three administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations on the matter. The Saudis and China last month held joint naval exercises hosted by the kingdom. And Beijing in 2023 helped mediate an agreement between the Saudi Arabia and Iran to reopen their embassies and exchange ambassadors amid ongoing tensions. China surpassed the U.S. last year as Saudi Arabia’s top trade partner, but the United States has remained Riyadh’s favored nation for arms sales. Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Congress could press the administration to detail what assurances Riyadh has given the White House about its relationship with China. Questions about Israel He added that the White House is likely to also face questions about plans to ensure Israel maintains its qualitative military edge. The announcement by Trump comes at a moment in which he’s trying to persuade Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations. He has talked up his push to extend his first-term Abraham Accords — the project that formalized commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and a trio of Arab nations — as key to his plan for bringing long-term stability to the Middle East as the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to hold. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday as he made his way to Florida for the weekend. Yet Trump’s optimism that a U.S.-brokered deal could come soon is tempered by more sober internal assessments. The Saudis have made clear that a guaranteed path to a Palestinian state remains a condition for the kingdom signing onto the accords — something Israel vehemently opposes. The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. Still, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to sign on to the accords anytime soon, but there is cautious optimism that an agreement can be sealed by the end of Trump’s second term, the officials said. “Let’s hope that President Trump makes clear that the first F-35 will not be delivered until Saudi Arabia normalizes relations with Israel,” Bowman said. “Otherwise, the president will undercut his own leverage.” The Trump administration formally notified Congress in November 2020 that it planned to sell 50 stealth F-35 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates as part of a broader arms deal worth $23 billion aimed at deterring potential threats from Iran, despite concerns raised by Israel. The UAE announcement came shortly after Trump lost the 2020 election to Democratic Joe Biden and followed the signing of the Abraham Accords between and the UAE. But Biden, soon after taking office in January 2021, put a hold on that sale. Human rights issues Trump’s move is likely to receive scrutiny from human rights activists as Prince Mohammed’s trip marks his first visit to Washington since 2018. On that visit, the crown prince went on a three-week U.S. tour aimed at improving the perception of his nation in the eyes of Americans concerned by the kingdom’s conservative social mores, its unequal treatment of women and the ignominious fact that 15 of 19 hijackers that took part in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States were Saudi citizens. The Saudis’ reputation was further eroded months after Prince Mohammed’s last Washington visit with the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, an operation targeting a critic of the kingdom that U.S. intelligence agencies later determined Prince Mohammed likely directed. The crown prince has denied he was involved. But seven years later, the dark clouds in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have been cleared away by Trump, who has tightened his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince he views as an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. “They have been a great ally,” Trump said. —- AP Diplomatic writer Matthew Lee contributed reporting."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/north-south-korea-border-tensions-talks-6af983af56c925fba2e583a020f07dab","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:27:27+00:00","title":"South Korea Proposes Talks with North Korea to Clarify Border Line and Ease Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea has proposed military talks with North Korea to clarify their disputed border line and prevent an accidental armed clash, citing repeated border intrusions by North Korean troops.

South Korea proposed talks with North Korea to clarify the rivals’ border line and ease military tensions, saying Monday that North Korean soldiers’ repeated border intrusions have raised worries about an armed clash. South Korea’s military says it has been firing warning shots to repel North Korean troops who violated the border’s military demarcation line numerous times since they began works to boost front-line defenses last year. North Korea has denied its soldiers’ alleged border breaches and threatened unspecified responses. Kim Hong-Cheol, South Korea’s deputy minister for national defense policy, said Monday that the country was offering military talks to prevent an accidental armed clash and lower tensions with North Korea. He said that the North’s border intrusions were likely caused by the rivals’ different views on the border line, because many of the military demarcation line posts established at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War have been lost. It’s unclear if North Korea would accept South Korea’s calls for talks, because it’s been shunning all forms of dialogue with South Korea and the U.S. since its leader Kim Jong Un’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with U.S. President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to resume diplomacy with Kim, but the North Korean leader has suggested that he could meet Trump again only if Washington withdraws the denuclearization of North Korea as a precondition for talks.

Follow on Last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that his country was abandoning its long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and ordered the rewriting of the North’s constitution to mark the South as a permanent enemy. South Korea’s military said that it has since detected North Korea adding anti-tank barriers and planting more mines at border areas. The Koreas’ 248-kilometer-long (155-mile-long), four-kilometer-wide (2½-mile-wide) border is one of the world’s most heavily armed frontiers . An estimated 2 million mines are peppered inside and near the border, which is also guarded by barbed-wire fences, tank traps and combat troops on both sides.

Israel (AP) — The number of Palestinians dying in Israeli custody surged to nearly 100 people since the start of the war in Gaza, according to a report published Monday by a human rights group that says systematic violence and denial of medical care at prisons and detention centers contributed to many of the deaths it examined. The picture that emerges from the report by Physicians for Human Rights -Israel is consistent with findings by The Associated Press , which interviewed more than a dozen people about prison abuses, medical neglect and deaths, analyzed available data, and reviewed reports of autopsies. AP spoke with a former guard and a former nurse at one prison, an Israeli doctor who treated malnourished prisoners brought to his hospital, former detainees and their relatives, and lawyers representing them and rights groups. The former guard at a military prison notorious for its harsh treatment of Palestinians told the AP detainees were routinely shackled with chains and kicked and hit with batons, and that the facility had been dubbed a “graveyard” because so many prisoners were dying there. He agreed to talk to AP to raise awareness of violence in Israeli prisons and spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal. Related Stories Israeli military detains 9 soldiers over alleged abuse of a detainee at a shadowy military facility Israel maintains a shadowy hospital in the desert for Gaza detainees. Critics allege mistreatment Told to fix notorious prison, Israel just relocated alleged abuses, detainees say Of the 98 prisoner deaths PHRI documented since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war, 27 occurred in 2023, 50 in 2024 and 21 this year, the most recent on Nov. 2. PHRI says the actual death toll over this timeframe is “likely significantly higher,” noting that Israel has refused to provide information about hundreds of Palestinians detained during the war. Fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years preceding the war, PHRI says. But since the war, the prison population more than doubled to 11,000 as people were rounded up, mainly from Gaza and the West Bank. The number of prisoners dying grew at an even faster rate over that period, PHRI data shows. PHRI documented deaths by interviewing former detainees and prison medical staff, examining reports prepared by doctors who observed autopsies at the behest of dead prisoners’ families, and confirming dozens of fatalities through freedom of information requests. “The alarming rate at which people are killed in Israeli custody reveals a system that has lost all moral and professional restraint,” said Naji Abbas, a director at PHRI. Last year, the head of Israel’s prison system, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, boasted that he had degraded prison conditions to the legal minimum. Under pressure from rights groups, conditions improved slightly. Israel’s Prison Service said it operates in accordance with the law. It declined to comment on the death count and directed any inquiries to Israel’s army. The army said it is aware some detainees have died, including people with preexisting illnesses or combat-related injuries. But army spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said the death count in the PHRI report is inflated, while declining to say what the army believes the real number to be. It said allegations of abuse or inadequate conditions are assessed, and that those who violate the army’s code of conduct are punished and sometimes subject to criminal investigations. Guards told to reduce the number of deaths This undated photo from winter 2023 provided by Breaking The Silence, a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers, shows blindfolded Palestinian prisoners captured in the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces at a detention facility on the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Although hesitant at first, the former guard at the Sde Teiman military prison in southern Israel said he eventually participated in beatings of prisoners. One morning, early in Israel’s war against Hamas, the guard arrived at work to see a motionless Palestinian lying on his side in the yard, yet no guards rushed to see what had happened to the man, who was dead. “It was sort of business as usual with the dead guy,” said the guard, who didn’t know the cause of death. Prisoners’ arms and legs were always in chains, and they were beaten if they moved or spoke, the guard said, adding that nearly all would urinate and defecate on themselves rather than ask to use the bathroom. The former nurse at Sde Teiman said chains used to restrain many prisoners’ arms and legs caused such severe wounds that some needed their limbs to be amputated. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. During the several weeks she worked there at the start of last year she didn’t see anyone die, but she said the staff at times talked about prisoner deaths. She left the job because she didn’t like the abusive treatment of the prisoners, she said. The army said prolonged handcuffing is implemented only in exceptional cases when there are “significant security considerations.” Even then, detainees’ medical condition is taken into account, it said. Only a few detainees from Gaza are currently being handled this way, it added. Guards were told by their commanders – who also participated in the beatings -- that they needed to reduce the deaths, according to the Sde Teiman guard, who spent several months there. Eventually cameras were installed, which helped mitigate the abuse, he said. Twenty-nine prisoners have died at Sde Teiman since the war began, according to PHRI. Earlier this year, an Israeli soldier was convicted of abusing Palestinians in Sde Teiman and sentenced to seven months in prison, according to the army, which said this shows there is accountability. But lawyers for prisoners say Israel rarely conducts serious investigations into alleged violence and that this fuels the problem. In a sign of the public climate, the Israeli military’s top lawyer was recently forced to resign after acknowledging she approved the leak of a surveillance video at the center of an investigation into allegations of severe sexual abuse against a Palestinian at Sde Teiman. The leak, meant to defend the decision by her office to prosecute guards for the alleged abuses, instead triggered fierce criticism from hard-line Israeli leaders who sympathized with the guards. Several soldiers were indicted in that case, which is still pending before the military court.

Sometimes, at the behest of prisoners’ families, doctors were granted permission by Israel to attend autopsies and provided reports to the families on what they saw. Eight reports seen by the AP showed a pattern of physical abuse and medical neglect. In one, a 45-year-old man who died in Kishon detention center, Mohammad Husein Ali, showed multiple signs of physical assault, likely causing brain bleed, according to the report. The potential use of excessive restraints was also noted. His family said he was healthy before he was detained from his home in the West Bank. He died within a week of being imprisoned. Husein Ali had previously served time in an Israeli prison after being convicted of association with militancy, according to his family. But they said he had no ties with militants when he was arrested last year. After Husein Ali was taken, his 2-year-old daughter would stare out the window calling for her father, said his wife, Hadeel. “She’d say ‘baba, where’s baba’, but after time she stopped asking,” she said, wiping tears from her eyes.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Malnutrition was a contributing factor in at least one death, according to PHRI, leading to a 17-year-old boy dying from starvation. In September, Israel’s Supreme Court ordered that more and better food be served to Palestinian inmates. Rights groups say the situation has slightly improved. The army said detainees receive three meals a day, approved by a dietitian. It said every detainee is examined by a doctor upon arrival and, for those who need it, monitored with regular checkups. Former prisoner can’t forget what he witnessed Sariy Khuorieh, an Israeli-Palestinian lawyer from Haifa, said he was detained at the start of the war after Israel accused him of inciting violence through his social media posts. While in Megiddo prison for 10 days, Khuorieh says he saw a man die after repeated beatings. Khuorieh said the 33-year-old father of four from the West Bank was beaten almost daily. The man, and some of his relatives, had close ties to Hamas, according to a Palestinian security official and someone who knew the family, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for retaliation. The night before the man died, he screamed in pain for hours while in solitary confinement, said Khuorieh, who choked back tears while recounting what happened. The man had repeatedly called for a doctor, but none came, Khourieh said. A spokesperson for Israel’s Prison Service wouldn’t comment on the case. A report written about the man’s autopsy seen by AP said the cause of death was inconclusive but that there were signs of old and new bruising, including broken ribs. The report said it could be assumed that violence contributed to his death. When the guards opened the man’s cell they kicked and beat him before summoning a physician who tried to revive him and then pronounced him dead, said Khuorieh, who said he was able to see what was happening through the small window in his cell door. Once the man was pronounced dead, Khuorieh said one of the officer’s laughed and said: there’s “at least one less” to care about."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/933797459","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Timeline of a Major Legal Case: From Incident to Charges","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A significant legal case began with an incident on December 3, 2023, and has progressed through multiple stages over the past year.

A baker tells us where to tart \n         By Shereen Marisol Meraji, Sylvie Douglis \n        \n           Updated Monday, March 13, 2023 • 2:25 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         I baked my first pie in February of 2018. I know this because I posted  a picture of it on my Instagram  account. It had a blackberry filling and the taste was on-point. It looked, on the other hand, pretty hideous. My friend called me up to tell me that if I wanted to feel even  worse  about my first foray into pie baking, I should check out an Instagram account called  @lokokitchen . @lokokitchen is Lauren Ko's account, devoted to her exquisite, work-of-art pies. I was hooked on her patterns — each pie more intricate than the last. I'd never seen anything like it and I've been following her ever since. Her pies and tarts inspire me. Ko's cookbook  Pieometry  offers countless beautiful photographs of her 'bakes', accompanied by detailed instructions for latticework, tiled crusts and shingled fruit slices. Plus, if you're a fan of puns as much as pies, you're in for an additional treat.  I spoke with Ko about some simple ways to upgrade your pie game. But if you're feeling inspired to go all out, by all means! This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.  SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI: For people who are new to baking, where should they tart? LAUREN KO:  I see what you did there! I mean, a tart is a great place to start! It's not as time intensive or technical as a full blown pie. One of the things that's difficult about pie is the dough — it requires a gentle hand. But I make my tart pastry in a food processor so there's a little more leeway. It's not as delicate as pie dough. I also have some tart shells [in  Pieometry ] that are not pastry. You can blend up some speculoos cookies with some melted butter and you have a shell there. Or toast up coconut and pecans and add butter for another shell. There's some flexibility with ingredients.  If someone wanted to make a tart for Thanksgiving, what's a filling that feels holiday-appropriate? There's  a cranberry curd tart  in my book that's received rave reviews. It's got bright colors and bright flavors that will contrast with a lot of the richer, heavier desserts you might find. Also, a  hand-sliced pear tart  with a shortbread crust and a really easy, creamy cardamom filling. It looks very complicated, but is actually very simple to execute. It's a great way to kind of bring a showstopper to your table without having to worry about exerting too much time or effort. Okay, on to pie. What is your number one tip? The golden rule of pie-making is to keep everything cold. I pull out my butter right when I'm about to use it. I don't let it sit on the counter. And when I roll out my pie dough, I pull it straight from the fridge. With some of my more intricate pies, I like to pop them back in the fridge for a few minutes if things are getting kind of melty or soft as I'm working. And even once I've completed a pie, I like to pop them in the freezer while the oven heats up. That helps preserve the integrity of the design when it's baking in that hot oven.  The other nice thing about all these little steps is that it's really conducive to breaking up the process. So if somebody is in charge of a huge Thanksgiving meal and they're trying to kind of pace themselves, pie dough is a great thing that you can prepare in advance. What about filling? I watch a lot of  The Great British Baking Show , so I know it's easy to get a soggy bottom on a pie, especially if you're using fresh fruit. What's a good filling if you're feeling nervous about soggy bottoms?  Pumpkin pie is very traditional at this time of year. That's a good option because you have to blind bake your crust beforehand, which means that you bake the crust by itself before adding the filling and baking it a second time. My other tip is that I like to keep a pizza stone in the oven. I'll put my pie on a baking sheet to catch any errant juices, and then I just put that baking sheet right on the pizza stone, so that all that extra heat is directed to that pie pan to make sure there are no soggy bottoms. If people are feeling competent with the traditional pie situation and they're ready to get more creative, what are some things they can do to take it up a notch? I like to make colored pie dough by substituting ice water in the pie dough with either vegetable juice or fruit juice. Spinach juice will make a really nice green crust, blueberry juice will make a nice purple crust, beet juice will make a really deep magenta crust. And the really weird and beautiful thing about adding these natural colorings is that it doesn't really add any extra flavor. So it becomes a really great canvas for creating really beautiful designs that can go sweet or savory because you still retain that crispy, buttery flavor in the crust.  What about egg washes? Egg washes are personal! I don't use egg washes on my colored pie doughs because I want to preserve their vibrancy. But I do use an egg wash on a basic, un-dyed dough to create a deep golden brown color. I use a whole egg whisked with a splash of heavy cream. And I like to sprinkle on some demerara sugar as well to give it that extra shine and crunch.  Lauren Ko's signature spoke design: Step-by-step instructions Place a 2-inch circle cutter in the center of the filling as a reference point. Using a small pastry brush, lightly dab water around the edge of the pie shell.        Remove the dough strips from the fridge. Gently pick up a strip of dough, handling it only from the ends, and lay it across the pie, with the strip grazing the outside of the circle cutter. Lightly press the strip into the edges of the pie to secure. Place another dough strip across the pie. The center of this second strip should lay slightly on top of the first and also graze the center circle cutter. The end of the strip in your left hand should rest ½ inch to the left of the first strip and the end in your right hands to the right of the first.      Continue laying dough strips in this fashion, working your way around the pie surface twice. Resist the urge to manually curve each strip. The optical illusion of the full design inspires a curved effect, but the individual strips should be maintained as straight lines.          Press the edges of the pie to secure the strips in place. Holding a paring knife at a 45-degree angle to your work surface, run it around the edge of the pie pan to trim the excess dough. Gently remove the center ring cutter and carefully fill the crate with ¼ cup of blueberries. Bake and voila!  Tips and instructions courtesy of Lauren Ko.

And because it's pie season, we're going to share some tips from our guest, a pie-hard pie maker with a wildly popular Instagram account called lokokitchen - loko spelled L-O-K-O. LAUREN KO: My name is Lauren Ko, and I'm the author of the cookbook \"Pieometry.\" MERAJI: So, Lauren, I have been following you and your work since February of 2018, and I know this because I made my very first pie in February of 2018. And I posted it on Instagram because, of course, you know, if you don't put it on social media, it didn't happen. KO: Of course. MERAJI: It was an absolutely disastrous-looking pie. And a friend of mine called me on the phone and was like, oh, if you want to feel even worse about yourself, you need to follow lokokitchen on Instagram. And so I did. And I was like, oh, my God, these pies are works of art. You have a cookbook now. I'm so excited about it. And I absolutely love the first inscription. I was wondering, if you have it there, if you would mind reading it for us. KO: Yes. (Reading) To all the other regular nobodys out there minding their own business, dreaming dreams they don't even know they have, you never know where life will take you and what magic awaits. This is for you. MERAJI: What is the story behind that inscription? KO: It's basically my story. So I made my very first pie in the summer of 2016. I had just moved to Seattle and was looking for a job and, you know, as one does with too much time on their hands, was just puttering around on the Internet. And I stumbled across some really beautiful pictures of pie and thought, huh, I've been, you know, casually cooking and baking and, obviously, eating my entire life. But in my Chinese, Honduran, American family, there wasn't a lot of traditional apple pie or just pie in general going around. So I thought, I'll just try it. MERAJI: Lauren made an apple pie with a lattice top, and she said it was fine, which - trust me - is hard to believe if you've seen the pies and tarts she makes now. Fine is not a good descriptor. They're geometric masterpieces, hence the title of her cookbook, \"Pieometry.\" The second pie she made was what Lauren calls... KO: The ultimate piesaster. You know, I got kind of cocky. I was like, oh, I made my first pie, and it was fine. Like, I got this. Pie is not a big deal. And I made this Marionberry pie to take to my in-laws' for Thanksgiving dinner and had constructed this really intricate geometric top. I was so proud of it. But I was relatively inexperienced with pie baking, so unbeknownst to me, I had severely underbaked it. So we drove to Portland, and it basically leaked all over the backseat. It looked like a crime scene. All the, like, berry juices were everywhere. I was trying to sop it up. And then we got to Portland. I tried to rebake it, thinking that, you know, I'll just pop it back in the oven. It'll be fine. It was not fine. It was still undercooked. And my in-laws are saints, and they insisted on eating the pie. So I had to sit there mortified, watching everybody at the table eat the sole dessert that was severely undercooked. So, yeah, now I know to kind of bake until the filling is ready and make sure that there aren't any soggy bottoms before I take it out of the oven - that kind of thing. MERAJI: Obviously, Lauren continued to make pies after that bake fail. And she, like me and so many of us, posted her creations on her personal Instagram page until her friends and fam were over it. So she started her separate lokokitchen account on August 29, 2017. It was supposed to document all kinds of cooking triumphs, not just pies and tarts, but her first post was of a peach pie with the caption, life's a peach, and then you pie. She got a couple hundred likes, which had never happened before. KO: And so I waited a couple days, and I was like, OK, I'll post another photo - I think it was a tart - and see what happens. And again, a couple hundred likes. MERAJI: She kept posting pie and tart pics. And two months later, a popular design site shared one. KO: We watched my phone blow up that day. I got 8,000 followers in a matter of hours. By December of that year, I had hit 100,000 followers. And a couple weeks later, I quit my job to do this full-time. MERAJI: Lauren Ko is now living the dream she never knew she had, and she's going to share some practical tips after the break for those of you looking to level up your quarantine kitchen skills. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MERAJI: All right, so let's talk about some tips here for people who are still new to baking who want to attempt to make a pie from scratch. Where do you think we should tart? KO: (Laughter) See what you did there - my people. MERAJI: Yes. KO: Yeah. I mean, a tart is a great place to start. I think it's not as time-intensive or as technical as maybe a full-blown pie. I think one of the things that is difficult about pie is making pie dough, and it kind of requires a gentle hand. You don't want to overwork the dough. It's not like bread, where you have to knead it a lot. But I make my tart pastry in a food processor, and so there's a little more leeway in case you kind of overmix it. There is the possibility or a risk of overmixing it, but it's not quite as delicate as pie dough. And I also have some tart shells in there that aren't pastry. So you blend up some speculoos cookies with some melted butter, and you have a crust there. Or you toast off some coconut and pecans and add a little bit of butter, and you have a tart shell there. So I think there's a lot more flexibility in terms of ingredients as well. MERAJI: So if somebody wanted to make a tart for Thanksgiving and not a pie, what do you think is a filling that feels holiday-appropriate or Thanksgiving-appropriate? KO: There's a cranberry curd tart in my book, and that is actually the tart that I redeemed myself with the following Thanksgiving to rave reviews. It's got some bright colors and also bright flavors to contrast with a lot of the kind of richer, heavier desserts that you might find. I also have a hand-sliced pear tart that has a... MERAJI: Oh, yeah. KO: ...Shortbread crust, a really easy, creamy cardamom filling, and then just fresh hand-sliced pears on top. So looks very complicated but is actually very simple and straightforward to execute and is a great way to kind of bring a showstopper to your table without having to worry about exerting too much time or effort. MERAJI: OK, let's talk about pies. KO: Let's. MERAJI: What if someone is not a tart person, they want to go straight to pie making? What is the first tip that you would give them? KO: Well, the golden rule of pie making is to keep everything cold. So you want all your ingredients to be cold when you set out to make your pie dough. I pull out my butter right when I'm about to use it. Don't let it sit on the counter. And then later, when I'm about to roll out my pie dough, I pull it straight from the fridge, make sure it's cold. And then with some of my more intricate pies or any sort of cut-out tops that just take a little bit longer, I like to pop them back in the fridge for a few minutes if things are getting kind of melty or soft just to chill things back down before I continue with the design process. MERAJI: So keep things cold throughout the process. KO: Yes, throughout the process. And even once I've completed a pie with the pie top, everything set, I like to pop my pies in the freezer while the oven heats. That way, the design is nice and cold, nice and set. And that kind of helps preserve the integrity of the design when it's baking in that hot oven heat. And the other nice thing about kind of all these little steps and having to keep things cold is that it's really conducive to breaking up the process. So pie making can be pretty time-intensive. It's not always active time, but, you know, you can make your pie dough, let it rest in the fridge for, you know, a couple hours and then pop it in the freezer so that maybe next week you have time to make a pie. Pull out that dough, let it thaw, and then you can roll out the dough and continue on your process. So if somebody is in charge of a huge Thanksgiving meal and they're trying to kind of pace themselves, pie is a great thing that you can kind of prepare in advance, and you don't have to worry about it that day. MERAJI: I need to do that. I've never done that. I'm always just, like, suffering at the last minute. KO: Oh, yeah. This will take a lot of stress out of your life. MERAJI: Yeah. What about the filling? You know, I watch a lot of \"The Great British Baking Show,\" so I know it's easy to get a soggy bottom on a pie. This happens especially if you're using fresh fruit. So what's a good filling to use if you're nervous about soggy bottoms? KO: Pumpkin pie is very traditional at this time of year. That is a good option for avoiding soggy bottoms because often, you have to blind bake your crust beforehand, which means that you're just baking your crust by itself, you know, for 20 to 30 minutes, and then you add the filling. And then you bake it until the filling is set. So you basically ensure that your crust is going to be nice and crispy. My other tip is I like to keep a pizza stone in the oven so it's nice and hot while the oven heats up. And then I put my pie on a baking sheet to catch any errant juices, and then I just put that baking sheet right on the pizza stone so all that extra heat is directed to that pie pan to make sure there are no soggy bottoms. MERAJI: If people are listening and they're like, yeah, I got this traditional pie stuff; I know how to do this, and they want to get more creative, what's something that they could do to make their pie crust or tart crust stand out? KO: So one thing that I like to do is to make colored pie dough, and all of my colorings are natural. So I like to substitute that ice water in the pie dough with either vegetable juice or fruit juice. So something like spinach juice will make a really nice green crust, or blueberry juice will make a nice purple crust, or beet juice will make a really deep magenta crust. And the really weird and beautiful thing about adding these natural colorings is that it doesn't really add any extra flavor. So it becomes a really great canvas for creating really beautiful designs that can go sweet or savory because you still retain that crispy, buttery flavor in the crust without it tasting like, you know, a salad covering a blueberry pie or, you know, whatever it is that's in your filling, while lending it that really beautiful design element as well. MERAJI: What about egg washes? How important is an egg wash to a pie? KO: I think it depends on personal preference. So I have friends who have, you know, egg allergies, and I think that an egg wash doesn't make or break your pie. Personally, I don't egg wash any pies that I use colored doughs in because I want to preserve the integrity and the vibrancy of that color. And we use an egg wash to create that really deep brown, golden color. But when I use just my basic all-butter pie dough, I like to do a whole egg with a splash of heavy cream, and that gives a really deep golden color. And then I like to sprinkle on some Demerara sugar as well to give it that extra shine and crunch. MERAJI: OK, this is not a cooking question. It's not a question about pies, but it is about social media and sharing your work on social media. A lot of people are doing this thing that you did, which is creating devoted Instagram accounts for projects. Do you have any tips or words of wisdom about sharing on social media? KO: The first thing I always tell people is to be an original. You know, find kind of your niche, and find what kind of sets you apart from the crowd, what makes you stand out. Creating these geometric modern pie art pieces, I guess, was more of like an exploration of art and a creative outlet for me. Then this just felt like a really cool hobby, and it just so happened that I had this kind of venue to share it with, and people were responding really well. So I thought, well, you know, if it's making people happy, I'm happy to share, and I'm also happy kind of having this extra kind of part of my life and this outlet for kind of zoning out and creating something different.

out a violent attack on the Palestinian village of al-Jab’a in the West Bank, setting homes and vehicles on fire in a surge of settler violence that has intensified since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. This violence, which has totaled over 2,660 incidents and 690 Palestinian deaths this year, prompted rare condemnation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who labeled the actions of settlers as 'a handful of extremists' and emphasized the need for law enforcement action. Despite this, Netanyahu has established a government committee to investigate the October 7 attacks, a move criticized by opposition leaders and the public as lacking independence and potentially being a cover-up. Simultaneously, international diplomacy is progressing with the U.N.

The violence drew a rare condemnation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top leaders. Israel’s military said soldiers and police were sent to al-Jab’a, a small village southwest of Bethlehem, after reports of fires and vandalism. The attack came hours after clashes between Israeli security forces and settlers defending an unauthorized outpost on a nearby hill facing evacuation and demolition on Monday, according to COGAT, the Israeli military body that deals with civilians in the West Bank. Israeli police said earlier that six suspects were arrested in confrontations during the demolitions, where dozens of Israeli settlers were entrenched and hundreds rioted, throwing stones and metal bars and burning tires. The Monday night attack in al-Jab’a was the latest in a growing wave of settler violence to hit West Bank villages, which has surged this fall as Palestinians take part in their annual olive harvest. Violence carried out by settlers and Palestinian militants have both spiked as the Israeli military has stepped up operations in the occupied West Bank since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war .

Humanitarian office reported that October saw the highest number of Israeli settler attacks since tracking began with more than 260 incidents causing injuries or property damage. That’s on top of 2,660 settler attacks documented this year through the end of September. Six hundred ninety Palestinians and 38 Israelis have been killed this year during the uptick in violence across the territory. ‘A handful of extremists’ Netanyahu called the settlers “a handful of extremists” and urged law enforcement to pursue them for “the attempt to take the law into their own hands.” “I intend to deal with this personally, and convene the relevant ministers as soon as possible to provide a response to this serious phenomenon,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu’s denunciation came at the outset of a busy week of diplomacy for Israel and after U.S. officials warned violence in the West Bank could undermine the month-old ceasefire in Gaza. Yet despite the violence, it appeared to be advancing. The U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. plan for Gaza authorizing an international force to provide security and envisioning a possible path to an independent Palestinian state. The vote was a crucial next step in U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire plan. Israeli leaders did not comment on the resolution but Netanyahu has previously voiced staunch opposition to moves toward establishing a Palestinian state and has long asserted doing so would reward Hamas. Netanyahu’s remarks against settler violence also come ahead of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ’s arrival in Washington. Trump is expected to lobby him to normalize relations with Israel and join the Abraham Accords . But the crown prince has insisted he will not take that step without a viable path to statehood for Palestinians. Formal ties with Saudi Arabia would be a major victory for the embattled prime minister, who on Sunday approved the establishment of a government committee to investigate the security failures that allowed Hamas-led militants to storm southern Israel and kill around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu moves to shape inquiry The prime minister’s announcement of the committee angered many in Israel who responded with concerns about its makeup. The Oct. 7 committee approved by Netanyahu’s Cabinet differs from the kind of judge-led independent commission that Israel has convened in the past. Netanyahu, who previously resisted calls for an investigation, will oversee the makeup of the team governing the inquiry, in effect putting him in charge of the probe. In Sunday’s decision, he said the ceasefire that went into effect on Oct. 10 allows the government to start the investigation. Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, called the decision insulting to the victims of Oct. 7 and to the hundreds of soldiers who have died in the war. “The government is doing everything it can to run from the truth and evade responsibility,” Lapid said. Survey data based on 1,000 respondents published by the Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute last month suggested nearly three-quarters of the public support a fully independent commission of inquiry. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, which is critical of Netanyahu, said, “This is not an investigative commission, this is a cover-up commission.” More details about the inquiry are to be announced in 45 days. The Israeli military and other security bodies have conducted a number of investigations into their failures on Oct. 7. But the committee will also look at governmental decision-making and assumptions that created the conditions for the attack to occur. In Gaza, flooding compounds woes Flooding has added yet another layer to the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza. The U.N. humanitarian office said 13,000 families were affected by the rain that began late last week. Abdallah Abu Quta, displaced to a tent with his family, called the suffering indescribable. “All night, we and the children were awake, shivering from the cold. We made a channel in the ground to drain the water out,” he said on Sunday. Israel sweeping military offensive has throughout the war killed more than 69,000 Palestinians in the coastal enclave, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. The war, which began with Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has triggered other conflicts in the region, sparked worldwide protests and led to allegations of genocide that Israel denies. ___ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data — a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump . Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank, and the advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period. Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too. “There’s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they’re falling behind,” Margetta Morgan said. Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity , and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.

The president spoke about the economy and affordability issues Monday at an event hosted by the McDonald’s fast food company. “We have it almost at the sweet spot and prices are coming down on different things,” Trump said at the event, adding that inflation has been “normalized” at a “low level.” Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue , Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year’s midterm elections. Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills — meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills. The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration’s reputation. “In fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,” Trump posted on social media Friday. “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems.” Nearly 6 million households have utility debt “so severe” that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation’s analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel. During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills. “Voters are frustrated and families are hurting because these tech giants are cutting backroom deals with politicians, and it’s causing their power bills to go up,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers. “If the Trump administration doesn’t want to do its job and protect families and make life more affordable, I guess that’s its choice.” Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau. The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy. “Electricity prices are a state problem,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. “There are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.” The new analysis of utility bills by the groups counters that the Trump administration is contributing to higher utility costs “by impeding renewable energy generation” including solar and wind power. While that analysis is a warning sign, other economic analyses on consumers suggest their finances are stable despite some emerging pressures. The New York Federal Reserve has said delinquency rates of 90 days or more for mortgages, auto loans and student debt have each increased over the past 12 months, though it said mortgage delinquencies are “relatively low.” An analysis of debit and credit card spending by the Bank of America Institute showed that consumers’ “overall financial health looks sound.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-arrests-federal-agents-trump-0e143aa0161c998997e33fc1f52656d9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:12:19Z","title":"Trump Administration Launches Immigration Enforcement Surge in Charlotte, North Carolina","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration launched 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' a targeted immigration enforcement campaign in Charlotte, North Carolina, led by CBP commander Gregory Bovino.

He also posted a highly-edited video of uniformed CBP officers handcuffing people. “From border towns to the Queen City, our agents go where the mission calls,” he posted on X, referring to Charlotte. The effort was dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web” as a play on the title of a famous children’s book that isn’t about North Carolina. Some welcomed the intervention, including Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby, who said in a post Saturday that the county GOP “stands with the rule of law — and with every Charlottean’s safety first.” Related Stories Tennessee judge blocks Trump’s use of National Guard in Memphis but gives time for government appeal 3 MIN READ Trump administration sues California over law banning masked federal agents 3 MIN READ Pope Leo XIV calls for urgent climate action and says God’s creation is ‘crying out’ 3 MIN READ Fear and many questions People rally against federal immigration enforcement after agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations across Charlotte.

On Saturday, at least one U.S. citizen said he was thrown to the ground and briefly detained. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on At Camino, a nonprofit group that offers services to Latino communities, some said they were too afraid to leave their homes to attend school, medical appointments or work. A dental clinic the group runs had nine cancellations on Friday, spokesperson Paola Garcia said. “Latinos love this country. They came here to escape socialism and communism, and they’re hard workers and people of faith,” Garcia said. “They love their family, and it’s just so sad to see that this community now has this target on their back.” Bovino’s operations in Chicago and Los Angeles triggered lawsuits over the use of force, including widespread deployment of chemical agents . Democratic leaders in both cities accused agents of inflaming community tensions. Federal agents fatally shot one suburban Chicago man during a traffic stop. Bovino, head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, and other Trump administration officials have called their tactics appropriate for growing threats on agents. Bovino posted pictures Sunday of people the Trump administration commonly dubs “criminal illegal aliens,” meaning people living in the U.S. without legal permission who allegedly have criminal records. That included one of a man with an alleged history of drunk driving convictions. “We arrested him, taking him off the streets of Charlotte so he can’t continue to ignore our laws and drive intoxicated on the same roads you and your loved ones are on,” Bovino said.

In the Chicago area, the agency only provided names and details on a handful of its more than 3,000 arrests in the region from September to last week. U.S. citizens were detained during several operations. Dozens of protesters were arrested. By Sunday, reports of CBP activity around Charlotte were “overwhelming” and difficult to quantify, Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said in an email. “The past two hours we’ve received countless reports of CBP activity at churches, apartment complexes and a hardware store,” he said. City council member-elect JD Mazuera Arias said federal agents appeared to be focused on churches and apartment buildings. “Houses of worship. I mean, that’s just awful,” he said. “These are sanctuaries for people who are looking for hope and faith in dark times like these and who no longer can feel safe because of the gross violation of people’s right to worship.” DHS says so-called sanctuary policy plays a role in Charlotte operation Two people were arrested during a small protest Sunday outside a DHS office in Charlotte and taken to a local FBI office, said Xavier T. de Janon, an attorney who was representing them. He said it remained unclear what charges they faced. DHS said it was focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents. Most North Carolina county jail operators have long honored “detainers,” or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. But some non-cooperation policies have existed in a handful of places in the state, including Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement. In Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, the sheriff previously did not honor detainers but said the jail now does as required under changes made to state law since last year. Several county jails house immigrant arrestees and honor detainers, which allow jails to hold detainees for immigration officers to pick them up. But Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, does not. Also, the city’s police department does not help with immigration enforcement. DHS alleged that about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored, putting the public at risk. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ___ This story has been updated to correct which of North Carolina’s county jail operators honor immigration detainers. Most have long honored detainer requests, and the Mecklenburg County sheriff says his jail also does so now as required under changes made to state law since last year. The story summary also misspelled the federal operation’s name, which is “Charlotte’s Web,” not “Charlotte’s Webb.” ___ Tareen and Dale reported from Chicago.

Their message: Our lives are on the line. As high-level ministers from governments around the world took over negotiations at the conference called COP30 , vulnerable nations lined up to say how important it is for countries to cut emissions. They said the world’s current climate plans aren’t strong enough to keep warming below the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set by the 2015 Paris Agreement . In addition, they renewed a longstanding call for rich nations to do more financially to help poor countries deal with warming. “Hurricane Melissa changed the life of every Jamaican in less than 24 hours,” said Matthew Samuda, the country’s economic growth minister. The Category 5 hurricane that hit three weeks ago caused almost $10 billion in damage and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. He called it evidence of “the new phase of climate change.” Matthew Samuda, minister of economic growth and job creation of Jamaica, speaks during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N.

A ruling earlier this year by the International Court of Justice that climate change is a planetary existential problem that must be fixed is “leverage” that small island countries will use to speed up climate-fighting efforts at COP30, said Tuvalu Attorney-General Laingane Italeli Talia.

COP30, more heavily fortified after a pair of demonstrations disrupted the main venue in the first week, kicked off its second week with foreign and other ministers stepping in for the lower-level negotiators who handled it earlier. They have far more power and leeway to make tough political decisions, and U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told them to use it. “The spirit is there, but the speed is not,” Stiell said. “The pace of change in the real economy has not been matched by the pace of progress in these negotiating rooms. As climate disasters wrecked millions of lives and hammer every economy, pushing up prices for food and other basic needs, we all know what’s at stake.” Other speakers also urged quicker action. “The time for promises is over,” Brazil Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said. “Each additional fraction of a degree of global warming represents lives at risk, greater inequality and greater losses for those who contributed least to the problem.” U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock said recent disasters show how much needs to be done. “The climate crisis is unrelenting,” she said. “We saw this when Hurricane Melissa barreled into the Caribbean two weeks ago. We saw it again last week at the Philippines ... near back-to-back typhoons.” ‘Our existence is at stake’ Adding to the pressure, late Sunday the Brazilian presidency of the talks issued a five-page summary on how to proceed on several sticky issues. Those include pressing nations to do more in their new emissions-cutting plans, handling of trade disputes and barriers involving climate and the need to deliver on last year’s $300 billion annual pledge for climate financial aid to poor nations. Those difficult issues weren’t part of the original agenda nor the COP30 presidency’s plans, but several countries pushed for them.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Several countries — especially small island nations — have asked that the talks address the inadequacy of the emissions-cutting plans submitted by 116 nations so far this year. Collectively, the plans come nowhere close to cutting heat-trapping gases enough to prevent breeching the 1.5-degrees Celsius warming limit since the 1800s. That issue may get combined with a call for a plan for phasing out fossil fuels — coal, oil and natural gas, the chief cause of climate change. That phaseout was agreed to after much debate at U.N. climate talks two years ago, but last year, little happened on the issue. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva earlier this month raised the issue anew. “Our very existence is at stake,” Mauritius Foreign Affairs Minister Dhananjay Ramful said. “A decade after the promises of the Paris Agreement, despite our good intentions, we realized that we have not done enough. ...

2025-11-17T09:37:19+00:00\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Bissan Younis looked dejected as she stood outside a cluster of tents surrounded by rubble and debris, a wasteland that is a common sight across the Gaza Strip . The tiny encampment was yet another makeshift school that has no room for her teenage son Kareem. “Most of the schools are destroyed,” she told The Associated Press. “Every school I go to tells me there is no room.” More than 600,000 Palestinian children in Gaza have missed the past two years of school because of the war between Israel and the militant Hamas group . Instead of studying and socializing, they have been repeatedly displaced, fled airstrikes and shelling and often spent their days scouring for water and food for their families. With a ceasefire reached last month largely holding, humanitarian officials are now working frantically to reopen dozens of makeshift schools. John Crickx, a spokesman for the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF, said it’s critical for children to return to classes as soon as possible, not just because of basic education but also for their mental health. “In the weeks to come, if we don’t offer education,” he said, there could be “terrible consequences for an entire generation.” Related Stories UN approves the Trump administration’s plan for the future of Gaza 4 MIN READ Israeli settlers torch West Bank village as Israel begins a busy diplomatic week 4 MIN READ Poland blames sabotage for railway blast on Ukraine delivery line 3 MIN READ UNICEF estimates that over 630,000 Palestinian children missed out on school during the war.

Most of the UNRWA-run schools, which catered to half of the Gaza children before the war, have since turned into shelters for displaced people. No space for tents Lack of space is a key obstacle: Dozens of schools were badly damaged or completely destroyed. Many are still being used as shelters for Palestinians who have been repeatedly displaced during the enclave’s intense bombardment. “It’s basically tents among the displaced people’s tents or it is some prefabs or shelters, said Crickx. “It’s very much ... the most basic learning.” At one school — a cluster of tents with the UNICEF logo erected on a patch of land amid bombed-out buildings in the southern city of Khan Younis — children huddled closely in one classroom, eagerly listening to their teacher. Crickx said that finding a location to put up the tents has been tricky. Another challenge is getting supplies into Gaza, whether concrete to fix damaged schools or simple pencils, erasers and other basic supplies. Since the Oct. 7, 2023 start of the war with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, these items have not been allowed into Gaza. Israel, which controls the flow of goods into the territory, considers them “non-critical, non-life saving,” Crickx said. COGAT, the Israeli military body that coordinates aid to Gaza, had no immediate comment on allowing in school supplies to Gaza. Even the children who return to makeshift schools were able to enroll carry the psychological burdens that come with war and displacement. “The level of trauma among the people of Gaza, including children, is horrific,” said UNRWA communications director Juliette Touma. U.N. agencies say they are struggling to asses the damages and figure out the costs — with the ceasefire still in its early stages, reconstruction of Gaza has not yet begun and U.N. experts say the process could take years and cost some $70 billion. Schools that turned into shelters Displaced families continue to live in the ruins of damaged schools. UNRWA’s Touma says about 75,000 people still shelter in the agency’s schools. One of the displaced, Tahreer al-Oweini says she feels guilty but that she had no choice. “I live in a classroom that should be in session with a teacher, students, and a blackboard,” said al-Oweini. Around her, damaged walls and ceilings are covered with tarp. Al-Oweini said she is struggling to secure spots for her three daughters and a son who are in elementary and middle school. She even told one school principal that she will search for a chair and desk for her daughter but was still rejected. “The children forgot everything they learned,” she said. “Their life over the past two years has been getting water, running after aid vehicles, war, Hamas, shelling, destruction.” “They have lived in fear or horror,” she added. Even during the most intense fighting, there have been some efforts in displacement camps and communities to keep children from falling behind in school, even as everyone struggled with bombardment, power cuts, and shortages of food, water, and medicine. But lessons were sporadic, and some families say they kept their children close and couldn’t risk letting them attend classes, fearing for their lives. It’s a race against time and UNRWA’s Touma warns of a “lost generation” — the longer the children stay out of school, the tougher it will be to someday catch up with their peers elsewhere. Touma is worried that if children miss out on education, the more likely they are to fall “prey to exploitation, including child marriage, child labor, and recruitment into armed groups.” Al-Oweini, like other families desperate to get their children back to school, is still hopeful. “I want my children to be like their father who finished university,” she said, adding that her daughters want to become doctors or engineers. “They have ambition,” she said. “But if they don’t go to school, they will have no future.” ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

The U.S. resolution that passed the U.N. Security Council authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in Gaza, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. “This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!” Trump posted on social media. The vote endorses Trump’s 20-point ceasefire plan and builds on the momentum of the fragile ceasefire he helped broker with allies. It marks a key next step for American efforts to outline Gaza’s future after the Israel-Hamas war destroyed much of the territory and killed tens of thousands of people. The proposal calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Trump would head. It also provides a wide mandate for the international stabilization force, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expire at the end of 2027.

Mike Waltz said the resolution “represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security.” It came about following nearly two weeks of negotiations , when Arab nations and the Palestinians pressed the United States to strengthen language about Palestinian self-determination. But the proposal still gives no timeline or guarantee for an independent state, only saying it’s possible after advances in the reconstruction of Gaza and reforms of the Palestinian Authority, which now governs parts of the West Bank.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The U.S. revised the resolution to say that after those steps, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it adds. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood and repeated that position Sunday at a time when his hard-line governing partners have expressed concern about the resolution’s endorsement of a “pathway” to Palestinian independence. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters before the vote that Israel was grateful to Trump “for leading peace to the Middle East.” Algeria’s U.N. Ambassador Amar Bendjama, the Arab representative on the council, thanked Trump for his instrumental role in bringing about the ceasefire, but said “genuine peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice, justice for the Palestinian people.” A key to the resolution’s adoption was support from Arab and other Muslim nations that had been critical to the ceasefire and potentially could contribute to the international force. The U.S. mission to the United Nations distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for “swift adoption” of the U.S. proposal. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow took note of that support but abstained because the resolution did not include a role for the Security Council or emphatically support Palestinian statehood. The vote shores up hopes that Gaza’s fragile ceasefire will be maintained following a war set off by Hamas’ surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s offensive has killed over 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children. What else the US proposal says Trump said the members of the Board of Peace will be named in the coming weeks, along with “many more exciting announcements.” The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure “the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip” and “the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” A big question has been how to disarm Hamas, which said Monday that giving the force a role inside Gaza that includes disarmament “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.” The resolution authorizes the force “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate” in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force.

what’s ahead for the U.S., according to a new survey from the American Communities Project. And despite President Donald Trump’s insistence that crime is out of control in big cities , residents of the nation’s largest metropolitan centers are less likely to list crime and gun violence among the chief concerns facing their communities than they were a couple years ago. Optimism about the future is also down from last year in areas with large Hispanic communities. These are some of the snapshots from the new ACP/Ipsos survey, which offers a nuanced look at local concerns by breaking the nation’s counties into community types, using data points like race, income, age and religious affiliation. The survey evaluated moods and priorities across the 15 different community types, such as heavily Hispanic areas, big cities and different kinds of rural communities. The common denominator across the communities? A gnawing worry about daily household costs. “Concerns about inflation are across the board,” said Dante Chinni, founder and director of ACP. “One thing that truly unites the country is economic angst.” Rising optimism in rural areas, despite economic anxiety Rural residents are feeling more upbeat about the country’s trajectory — even though most aren’t seeing Trump’s promised economic revival.

But Gruber, whose wife also is unable to work, is hopeful about the nation’s future, primarily in the belief that prices will moderate as Trump suggests. “Right now, the president is trying to get companies who moved their businesses out of the country to move them back,” said Gruber, a Trump voter whose support has wavered over the federal shutdown that delayed his monthly food benefit. “So, maybe we’ll start to see prices come down.” About 6 in 10 residents of Rural Middle America — Newark’s classification in the survey — say they are hopeful about the country’s future over the next few years, up from 43% in the 2024 ACP survey. Other communities, like heavily evangelical areas or working-class rural regions, have also seen an uptick in optimism. Kimmie Pace, a 33-year-old unemployed mother of four from a small town in northwest Georgia, said, “I have anxiety every time I go to the grocery store.” But she, too, is hopeful in Trump. “Trump’s in charge, and I trust him, even if we’re not seeing the benefits yet,” she said.

Robert Engel of San Antonio — Texas’ booming, second most-populous city — is worried about what’s next for the U.S., though less for his generation than the next. The 61-year-old federal worker, whose employment was not interrupted by the government shutdown nor Trump’s effort to reduce the federal workforce, is near retirement and feels financially stable. A stable job market, health care availability and a fair economic environment for his adult children are his main priorities. Recently, the inflation outlook has worsened under Trump. Consumer prices in September increased at an annual rate of 3% , up from 2.3% in April, when the president first began to roll out substantial tariff increases that burdened the economy with uncertainty. Engel’s less-hopeful outlook for the country is broader. “It’s not just the economy, but the state of democracy and polarization,” Engel said. “It’s a real worry. I try to be cautiously optimistic, but it’s very, very hard.” Crime, gun violence are less a concern in urban America Trump had threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he said was runaway, urban crime.

That tracks with the poll, which found that residents of America’s Big Cities and Middle Suburbs are less likely to list crime or gun violence among the top issues facing their communities than they were in 2023. For Angel Gamboa, a retired municipal worker in Austin, Texas, Trump’s claims don’t ring true in the city of roughly 1 million people. “I don’t want to say it’s overblown, because crime is a serious subject,” Gamboa said. “But I feel like there’s an agenda to scare Americans, and it’s so unnecessary.” Instead, residents of Big Cities are more likely to say immigration and health care are important issues for their communities. Big Cities are one of the community types where residents are most likely to say they’ve seen changes in immigration recently, with 65% saying they’ve seen a change in their community related to immigration over the past 12 months, compared with only about 4 in 10 residents of communities labeled in the survey as Evangelical Hubs or Rural Middle America. Gamboa says he has witnessed changes, notably outside an Austin Home Depot, where day laborers regularly would gather in the mornings to find work. Not anymore, he said. “Immigrants were not showing up there to commit crimes,” Gamboa said. “They were showing up to help their families. But when ICE was in the parking lot, that’s all it took to scatter people who were just trying to find a job.” Hispanic communities are less hopeful about the future After Hispanic voters moved sharply toward Trump in the 2024 election, the poll shows that residents of heavily Hispanic areas are feeling worse about the future of their communities than they were before Trump was elected. Carmen Maldonado describes her community of Kissimmee, Florida, a fast-growing, majority-Hispanic city of about 80,000 residents about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Orlando, as “seriously troubled.” The 61-year-old retired, active-duty National Guard member isn’t alone. The survey found that 58% of residents of such communities are hopeful about the future of their community, down from 78% last year. “It’s not just hopelessness, but fear,” said Maldonado, who says people in her community — even her fellow native Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens — are anxious about the Trump administration’s aggressive pursuit of Latino immigrants.

Beyond just the future of their communities, Hispanic respondents are also substantially less likely to say they’re hopeful about the future of their children or the next generation: 55% this year, down from 69% in July 2024. Maldonado worries that the Trump administration’s policies have stoked anti-Hispanic attitudes and that they will last for her adult child’s lifetime and beyond. “My hopelessness comes from the fact that we are a large part of what makes up the United States,” she said, “and sometimes I cry thinking about these families.” ___ Parwani and Thomson-DeVeaux reported from Washington. ___ The American Communities Project/Ipsos Fragmentation Study of 5,489 American adults aged 18 or older was conducted from Aug. 18 - Sept. 4, 2025, using the Ipsos probability-based online panel and RDD telephone interviews.

lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/calls-for-answers-grow-over-canadas-interrogation-of-israel-critic","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"22:53:22+00:00","title":"Calls for answers grow over Canada’s interrogation of Israel critic","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former United Nations human rights rapporteur, Richard Falk, 95, was questioned for several hours at the Canadian border on national security grounds, prompting outrage from human rights activists and critics who argue the incident reflects a broader government effort to silence dissent on Israel’s actions in Gaza.

He said a security official told him that Canada had concerns that he and his wife, fellow legal scholar Hilal Elver, posed “a danger to the national security of Canada”.\n\nThe treatment of the couple has sparked anger and calls for an explanation from Ottawa.\n\n“We need answers – and from the highest levels of government,” said Corey Balsam, national coordinator at Independent Jewish Voices-Canada, a group that supports Palestinian rights.\n\nDespite the outcry, Canadian authorities have not publicly addressed the incident. But the office of Minister of Public Safety Gary Anandasangaree, who oversees the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), has acknowledged the case in a statement to Al Jazeera, saying he is seeking more information about what happened.\n\n“National security safeguards are an integral part of our immigration and border-management framework and, while we cannot comment on specific cases, we are committed to ensuring that our border screening processes respect due process and international obligations,” Simon Lafortune, a spokesperson for Anandasangaree, told Al Jazeera in an email.\n\n“To that end, Minister Anandasangaree has asked the CBSA to provide more specific details on how this particular incident occurred.”\n\nFalk told Al Jazeera on Saturday that he and Elver were asked about their work on Israel, Gaza and genocide as well as about their participation in an event in Ottawa looking into Canada’s role in Israel’s war on Gaza, which a UN inquiry and numerous rights groups have described  as a genocide .\n\nAfter more than four hours of questioning, the pair – both US citizens – were allowed to enter Canada and take part in the Palestine Tribunal on Canadian Responsibility.\n\nAlex Paterson, senior director of strategy and parliamentary affairs at the advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, called the government’s treatment of the couple “patently ridiculous”.\n\n“I think it just lays bare for everyone the reality that they wanted to hamper the tribunal’s work and try and keep Canadian complicity in Israel’s genocide … in the shadows,” Paterson told Al Jazeera on Monday.\n\nHe added that the Canadian government “has been trying to avoid questions of its complicity in arming the genocide, and that’s reason enough to do this”.\n\nSince Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, Canadian human rights advocates have been calling on the government to apply pressure on Israel, a longstanding ally, to end its attacks on the Palestinian enclave.\n\nThose calls for concrete action from Canada have grown as Israel’s military assault and restrictions on aid have killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Gaza into a humanitarian crisis.\n\nLast year, the Canadian government announced it was suspending some weapons  export permits  to Israel amid the atrocities in the territory.\n\nPrime Minister  Mark Carney , who took office in March, also voiced opposition to Israel’s blockade on aid to Gaza and a surge in Israeli military and settler violence in the occupied West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, along with several allies, Carney’s government recognised an independent  Palestinian state  in September.\n\nBut researchers and human rights advocates said loopholes in Canada’s arms export system have allowed Canadian-made weapons to continue to reach Israel, often via the United States.\n\nThey have also urged Canada to do more to stem continued Israeli attacks against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and to support efforts to hold Israel accountable for serious abuses, including at the  International Criminal Court .\n\nIn his interview with Al Jazeera on Saturday, Falk, who served as UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory from 2008 to 2014, said he believed his interrogation was part of a wider push to silence those who speak the truth about what is happening in Gaza.\n\n“It suggests a climate of governmental insecurity, I think, to try to clamp down on dissident voices,” he said.\n\nAl Jazeera has contacted multiple relevant Canadian government agencies to ask whether Ottawa views the 95 year old as a threat to national security – and if so, why.\n\nA CBSA spokesperson said in an email on Monday that the agency could not comment on specific cases, but stressed that “secondary inspections are part of the cross-border process”.\n\n“It is important to note that travellers referred to secondary inspection are not being ‘detained,'” spokesperson Rebecca Purdy said.\n\n“Foreign nationals seeking entry into Canada can be subjected to a secondary inspection by an officer to determine admissibility to Canada. In some instances, the inspection may take longer due to information being gathered through questioning.”\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada, the Canadian foreign ministry, has not yet responded to a request for comment from Al Jazeera sent on Saturday.\n\nBalsam of Independent Jewish Voices-Canada said treating someone like Falk as a security threat sends a message that “actually none of us are safe from the suppression of dissent and crackdown on voices that are critical of  the Israeli regime “.\n\n“We all deserve an answer and an explanation from the government as to this incident, which casts a chill for all Canadians that are speaking out about human rights in general and Palestine in particular,” he told Al Jazeera."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/15/thousands-march-for-climate-action-outside-cop30-summit-in-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-15","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00+00:00","title":"Thousands march for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of people, including Indigenous activists and youth leaders, marched in Belém, Brazil, during the halfway point of the COP30 climate summit, demanding greater inclusion of Indigenous voices and urgent climate action.

for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil\n\nThousands of people have marched through the streets of the Brazilian city of Belem, calling for the  voices of Indigenous peoples  and environmental defenders to be heard at the United Nations COP30 climate summit.\n\nIndigenous community members mixed with activists at Saturday’s march, which unfolded in a festive atmosphere as participants carried a giant beach ball representing the Earth and a Brazilian flag emblazoned with the words “Protected Amazon”.\n\nIt was the first major protest outside the conference, which began earlier this week in Belem, bringing together world leaders, activists and experts in a push to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIndigenous activists previously  stormed the summit , disrupting the proceedings as they demanded that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva take concrete action to ensure their territories are protected from growing threats.\n\nAmnesty International warned in a recent report that  billions of people  around the world are threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel projects, such as oil-and-gas pipelines and coal mines.\n\nIndigenous communities , in particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make our voices heard from  the Amazon  and demand results,” he said. “We need more Indigenous representatives at COP to defend our rights.”\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help  poorer countries adapt to climate change."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/acting-fema-head-david-richardson-steps-down-after-troubled-tenure","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"21:01:20Z","title":"Acting

Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/disturbing-pattern-us-judge-rebukes-missteps-in-james-comey-indictment","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:00:08+00:00","title":"‘Disturbing pattern’: US judge rebukes ‘missteps’ in James Comey indictment","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A US magistrate judge, William Fitzpatrick, has issued a rare and strong rebuke of the Trump administration’s handling of the indictment against former FBI director James Comey, citing a 'disturbing pattern' of procedural missteps, potential misconduct, and violations of constitutional rights.

2025-11-17T20:00:08+00:00\n\nTitle: ‘Disturbing pattern’: US judge rebukes ‘missteps’ in James Comey indictment\n\nA magistrate judge in the United States has issued a stern rebuke to the administration of President Donald Trump, criticising its handling of the indictment against a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), James Comey.\n\nOn Monday, Judge William Fitzpatrick of Alexandria, Virginia, made the unusual decision to order the release of all grand jury materials related to the indictment.\n\nNormally, grand jury materials are kept secret to protect witnesses, defendants and jurors in cases of grave federal crimes.\n\nBut in Comey’s case, Fitzpatrick ruled there was “a reasonable basis to question whether the government’s conduct was willful or in reckless disregard of the law”, and that greater transparency was therefore required.\n\nHe cited several irregularities in the case, ranging from how evidence was obtained to alleged misstatements from prosecutors that could have swayed the grand jury.\n\n“The procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct,” Fitzpatrick wrote in his 24-page decision.\n\nFitzpatrick clarified that his decision does not render the grand jury materials public. But they will be provided to Comey’s defence team, as the former FBI director seeks to have the indictment tossed.\n\n“The Court recognizes that the relief sought by the defense is rarely granted,” Fitzpatrick wrote, underscoring the unusual nature of the proceedings.\n\n“However, the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.”\n\nThe decision is the latest stumble for interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer to Trump whom he then appointed as a top federal prosecutor.\n\nA specialist in insurance law with no prosecutorial background, Halligan was tapped earlier this year to replace acting US Attorney Erik Siebert in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nTrump has indicated he fired Siebert over disagreements about Justice Department investigations.\n\nAccording to media reports, Siebert had refrained from seeking indictments against prominent Trump critics, such as Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, citing insufficient evidence.\n\nBut that appears to have frustrated the president. Trump went so far as to call for Comey’s and James’s prosecutions on social media, as well as that of Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.\n\n“They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote in a  post  addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi. “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility.”\n\nHalligan took up her post as acting US attorney on September 22. By September 25, she had filed her  first major indictment , against Comey.\n\nIt charged Comey with making a “false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement” to the US Senate, thereby obstructing a congressional inquiry.\n\nA  second indictment , against James, was issued on October 9. And  a third  came on October 16, targeting former national security adviser John Bolton, another prominent Trump critic.\n\nAll three individuals have denied wrongdoing and have sought to have their cases dismissed. Each has also accused President Trump of using the legal system for political retribution against perceived adversaries.\n\nMonday’s court ruling is not the first time Halligan’s indictments have come under scrutiny, though.\n\nJust last week, US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie  heard petitions  from James and Comey questioning whether Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was legal.\n\nAs she weighed the petitions last Thursday, she questioned why there was a gap in the grand jury record for Comey’s indictment, where no court reporter appeared to be present.\n\nFitzpatrick raised the same issue in his ruling on Monday. He questioned whether the transcript and audio recording of the grand jury deliberations were, in fact, complete.\n\nHe pointed out that the grand jury in Comey’s case was originally presented with a three-count indictment, which it rejected. Those deliberations started at about 4:28pm local time.\n\nBut by 6:40pm, the grand jury had allegedly weighed a second indictment and found that there was probable cause for two of the three counts.\n\nFitzpatrick said that the span of time between those two points was not “sufficient” to “draft the second indictment, sign the second indictment, present it to the grand jury, provide legal instructions to the grand jury, and give them an opportunity to deliberate”.\n\nEither the court record was incomplete, Fitzpatrick said, or the grand jury weighed an indictment that had not been fully presented in court.\n\nThe judge also acknowledged questions about how evidence had been obtained in the Comey case.\n\nThe Trump administration was facing a five-year statute of limitations in the Comey case, expiring on September 30. The indictment pertains to statements Comey made before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020.\n\nTo quickly find evidence for the indictment, Fitzpatrick said that federal prosecutors appear to have used warrants that were issued for a different case.\n\nThose warrants, however, were limited to an investigation into Daniel Richman, an associate of Comey who was probed for the alleged theft of government property and the unlawful gathering of national security information.\n\nNo charges were filed in the Richman case, and the investigation was closed in 2021.\n\n“The Richman materials sat dormant with the FBI until the summer of 2025, when the Bureau chose to rummage through them again,” Fitzpatrick said.\n\nHe said the federal government’s use of the warrants could violate the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, which prohibits the unreasonable search and seizure of evidence. He described the Justice Department’s actions as “cavalier” and asserted that no precautions were taken to protect privileged information.\n\n“Inexplicably, the government elected not to seek a new warrant for the 2025 search, even though the 2025 investigation was focused on a different person, was exploring a fundamentally different legal theory, and was predicated on an entirely different set of criminal offenses,” Fitzpatrick wrote.\n\nHe speculated that prosecutors may not have sought a new warrant because the delay would have allowed the statute of limitations to expire on the Comey case.\n\n“The Court recognizes that a failure to seek a new warrant under these circumstances is highly unusual,” he said.\n\nFitzpatrick also raised concerns that statements federal prosecutors made to the grand jury may have been misleading.\n\nMany of those statements were redacted in Fitzpatrick’s ruling. But he described them as “fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the grand jury process”.\n\nOne statement, he said, “may have reasonably set an expectation in the minds of the grand jury that rather than the government bear the burden to prove Mr. Comey’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, the burden shifts to Mr. Comey to explain away the government’s evidence”.\n\nAnother appeared to suggest that the grand jury “did not have to rely only on the record before them to determine probable cause” — and that more evidence would be presented later on.\n\nCalling for the release of the grand jury records on Monday was an “extraordinary remedy” for these issues, Fitzpatrick conceded.\n\nBut it was necessary, given “the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings”, he ultimately decided."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/israels-ben-gvir-urges-killing-pa-officials-if-un-backs-palestinian-state","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:00:07Z","title":"Israel’s Ben-Gvir urges killing PA officials if UN backs Palestinian state","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has called for the targeted assassination of senior Palestinian Authority officials if the United Nations recognizes a Palestinian state, labeling PA leaders as 'terrorists' and claiming there is no such thing as a Palestinian people.

backs Palestinian state\n\nIsrael’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says Palestinian Authority (PA) officials should be assassinated if progress is made on the recognition of Palestinian statehood as a result of a pending United Nations vote.\n\nSpeaking at an Otzma Yehudit party meeting on Monday, Ben-Gvir called top PA officials “terrorists”, multiple Israeli media outlets reported.\n\n“If they accelerate the recognition of the Palestinian terrorist state, and the UN recognises a Palestinian state, targeted assassinations of senior Palestinian Authority officials, who are terrorists for all intents and purposes, should be ordered,” Ben-Gvir said, according to the Jerusalem Post newspaper.\n\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry and the presidency condemned the remarks in separate statements.\n\nIn a post on X, the Foreign Ministry described the comments as “systematic incitement” by Israeli officials and urged the international community to take “concrete measures” to hold Ben-Gvir accountable.\n\nThe presidency said it held the Israeli government responsible for Ben-Gvir’s statements.\n\nThe UN Security Council is scheduled later on Monday to vote on a resolution endorsing the  Gaza ceasefire plan  presented by the administration of United States President Donald Trump, which will back the formation of an international stabilisation force.\n\nThe proposal suggests that the UN would support a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.\n\nBen-Gvir said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should be arrested if the UN vote takes the idea of Palestinian statehood forward, adding that a solitary confinement cell is “ready for him” at Ketziot prison.\n\nThe PA recognises Israel and oversees security coordination with Israeli forces in the  occupied West Bank . But Israeli leaders have drawn a red line against establishing a Palestinian state led by the PA.\n\nIsrael has been pushing to change the wording in the UN’s Gaza proposal to avoid any mention of  Palestinian statehood . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also reassured his far-right coalition partners that his opposition to a Palestinian state remains unchanged.\n\nBen-Gvir went even further on Saturday, falsely claiming that the Palestinian people do not exist.\n\nThe national security minister said “there is no such thing as a Palestinian people” and called Palestinians a “collection of immigrants from Arab countries to the land of Israel” who have “sown terror, murder and atrocities everywhere”.\n\nHe reiterated his support for the so-called  “voluntary migration” of Palestinians  out of their lands, which critics say underscores Israeli plans for ethnically cleansing Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli authorities, from Ben-Gvir and the far-right parties forming Netanyahu’s coalition to the more moderate opposition figures, are all united in their unyielding objection to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state.\n\nBezalel Smotrich, Netanyahu’s finance minister who acts as a de facto governor of the  occupied West Bank , has been pushing for the annexation of the Palestinian territory as another response to the growing international support for Palestinian statehood.\n\nIsraeli officials have also repeatedly stressed that they will not allow the PA to become the governing force in Gaza.\n\nBut the US proposal on Gaza envisages a role for the PA, provided it engages in substantial “reforms”.\n\nPer the plan put forward by Washington, Gaza’s governance is to be handled by an international “board of peace” with a technocratic Palestinian administration on the ground along with the stabilisation force.\n\nBut Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza  have criticised  the draft resolution at the UN, warning it would pave the way for foreign control over Palestinian decision-making and handing over governance and reconstruction to a supranational body.\n\nThe factions insisted on Monday that humanitarian aid should be managed by Palestinian institutions under UN supervision. They also rejected disarming Gaza or curbing the right to resist, and called for international mechanisms to hold Israel accountable for rights abuses."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status due to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak that began in October 2024, with over 5,000 cases and two deaths reported across 10 provinces and territories.

Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/bbc-determined-to-fight-trump-lawsuit-over-panorama-documentary","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:32:56+00:00","title":"BBC ‘determined to fight’ Trump lawsuit over Panorama documentary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC has declared its intent to defend against a defamation lawsuit from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who alleges that a Panorama documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' misleadingly edited a speech from January 6, 2021, to portray him as inciting violence at the Capitol.

States President Donald Trump, expected to be filed this week.\n\nOn Monday, Samir Shah, the chair of the BBC’s board, said the British broadcaster is prepared to fight any complaint the president files.\n\n“I want to be very clear with you — our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case, and we are determined to fight this,” Shah wrote in a letter to BBC staff.\n\nThe letter follows an announcement on Friday from President Trump, saying that he planned to proceed with a lawsuit in the coming days.\n\n“We’ll sue them for anywhere  between a billion and $5bn , probably some time next week,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I think I have to do it.”\n\nThe controversy stems from the editing of a documentary for the investigative television series Panorama, titled Trump: A Second Chance?\n\nThe documentary aired in October 2024, days before Trump won his second term as president that November.\n\nTrump and his allies have alleged that the Panorama documentary sought to misrepresent his statements on January 6, 2021, when a group of his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican leader had lost that election to his Democratic rival Joe Biden. But he has falsely maintained that his defeat was due to widespread voter fraud.\n\nThe Panorama documentary  edited together two separate quotes  from Trump’s speech on the day of the riot that were delivered nearly an hour apart.\n\nTogether, they appeared to show Trump encouraging his supporters to “fight like hell” after walking down to the Capitol.\n\nTrump and his supporters say that the edit was misleading and that it leaves out critical context. At one point in the speech, for example, Trump told his supporters “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”.\n\nTrump also followed his appeal to walk down to the Capitol by calling on his supporters to “cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women”.\n\nThe controversy over the documentary has roiled the BBC at a time when the broadcaster faces allegations of internal bias, leaked to the media.\n\nEarlier this month, The Daily Telegraph  published an internal BBC memo  in which a former adviser, Michael Prescott, expressed concern about “systemic problems” in the broadcaster’s coverage of hot-button topics, including transgender rights and Israel’s war on Gaza, which experts have identified as a genocide.\n\nThe BBC has repeatedly denied institutional bias, and its leadership has stood by the quality of its reporting.\n\nBut the scrutiny has led to a shake-up in the broadcaster’s leadership. On November 9, its director general Tim Davie and its news head Deborah Turness both resigned in separate letters to BBC staff.\n\n“Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie wrote in his letter.\n\n“Our organisation is a critical ingredient of a healthy society, as well as a thriving creative sector. We should champion it, not weaponise it.”\n\nLast week, amid Trump’s threats of a lawsuit, the BBC  issued a “personal letter” of apology  to the US president.\n\nIt said Shah and the BBC were “sorry for the edit of the President’s speech”, according to a spokesperson’s statement. It also confirmed that the documentary would not be rebroadcast.\n\nBut Shah and the BBC nevertheless stood firm against the prospect of a lawsuit.\n\n“While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the statement said.\n\nTrump has a history of pursuing legal claims against news media he finds disfavourable, even when experts say his claims lack legal merit.\n\nLast year, for instance, Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against ABC News after an anchor in a live interview incorrectly said the US president had been “found liable for rape”.\n\nHe had been found liable for sexual abuse, not rape, in a civil case brought by writer E Jean Carroll.\n\nABC News  agreed to pay $15m to settle the lawsuit  in December 2024.\n\nTrump also sued CBS News for its editing of an interview with his 2024 election rival, Democrat Kamala Harris, on the TV programme 60 Minutes.\n\nIn July, CBS’s parent company Paramount  agreed to a settlement of $16m , which came as the company sought the Trump administration’s approval to proceed with a merger.\n\nLast month, Trump also refiled a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, one month after a federal judge threw it out.\n\nIn Monday’s letter, BBC chair Shah noted the cost such a lawsuit could exact on the BBC and its viewers, who pay a licensing fee to watch its products.\n\n“In all this we are, of course, acutely aware of the privilege of our funding and the need to protect our license fee payers, the British public,” Shah wrote.\n\nLegal experts believe Trump’s claims against the BBC  face an uphill battle , particularly in the US, where the First Amendment of the Constitution includes strong safeguards for the news media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/ethiopia-confirms-three-marburg-deaths-as-outbreak-sparks-regional-alarm","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:04:09Z","title":"Ethiopia confirms three Marburg deaths as outbreak sparks regional alarm","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ethiopia has confirmed three deaths from the Marburg virus in its southern Omo region, with three more suspected cases under investigation.

The crisis is primarily driven by food scarcity for bears, especially acorns and beech nuts, due to climate change and poor yields. Brown bears in Hokkaido, though rare, are more dangerous due to their size and strength, while Asiatic black bears on the mainland are more frequently encountered due to wider population distribution. Rural depopulation has created unmanaged habitats where bears can easily enter human settlements. In response, Japan’s military and riot police have been deployed to assist, but they are legally restricted from killing bears; instead, licensed private hunters conduct bear control. Residents in affected areas, especially Akita, are using AI-powered drones and surveillance systems to detect bears early.

bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1363","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"02:12:05+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,363","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On the 363rd day of the Russia-Ukraine war, as of November 18, 2025, the conflict continues with daily updates tracking key developments.

shelter crisis as Israeli restrictions on humanitarian supplies worsen conditions for  Palestinians displaced  by the war, the territory’s Government Media Office says.\n\nLocal authorities said in a statement on Monday that heavy rainfall over recent days submerged tens of thousands of makeshift tents across Gaza, leaving Palestinians suffering under conditions that “no society can endure”.\n\nThe Government Media Office warned that Palestinians are facing “the most dangerous humanitarian disaster” since the war began with Israel “deliberately deepening the catastrophe” through its blockade of essential shelter materials.\n\n“We strongly condemn this ongoing crime committed by the [Israeli] occupation against civilians,” it said.\n\n“We hold the occupation fully responsible for the suffering of hundreds of thousands of displaced people who are facing the harshness of winter without safe shelter or basic services, and for its catastrophic crime of insisting on completely closing the crossings and preventing the entry of shelter supplies.”\n\nThe flooding  began  on Thursday when the first winter storm hit Gaza. The United Nations confirmed more than 13,000 households were affected within hours.\n\nThe rain further damaged drainage systems already crippled by the war. In northern Gaza, the Sheikh Radwan Basin—a stormwater retention system—rose 37 cm, requiring continuous vacuum truck operations to prevent further flooding, the UN reported.\n\nConditions deteriorated over the following days as the rain continued, overwhelming the worn tents that have housed displaced families for nearly two years.\n\nMany displacement camps sit at lower elevations than surrounding areas. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud  reported  on Monday that “some areas are completely submerged” after water rushed in from all sides.\n\nGaza authorities said the enclave requires 300,000 tents and mobile homes to provide basic shelter, a figure they have “clearly stated” for months.\n\nHowever, Israel has prevented their entry despite a ceasefire that came into effect on October 10.\n\nMore than 80 percent of buildings across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed during the war, according to UN figures, forcing massive displacement.\n\nRights experts have said Israel’s campaign that turned most of Gaza into rubble amounts to genocide. Actions that  constitute a genocide , according to the United Nations, include “deliberately inflicting on [a] group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”.\n\nOn Monday, the Government Media Office accused Israel of “continuing its policy of restriction and preventing the entry of tents, tarps and plastic covers” while keeping border crossings closed and “reneging on implementing the humanitarian protocol” it signed as part of the ceasefire.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli military agency responsible for coordinating aid deliveries to Gaza, has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is restricting humanitarian supplies.\n\nBut Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA),  described  the situation last week as “misery on top of misery” and warned that Gaza’s fragile shelters “quickly flood, soaking people’s belongings”.\n\nUNRWA said it has enough supplies waiting in Jordan and Egypt to fill 6,000 trucks, including food to sustain Gaza’s entire population for three months. Yet Israeli restrictions mean only about half the required 500 to 600 aid trucks a day are entering the territory.\n\nUNRWA has also said it cannot bring pens and notebooks into the territory under import rules imposed by Israeli authorities.\n\nAid groups warned in early November that about 260,000 Palestinian families, totalling nearly 1.5 million people, faced vulnerability as winter approached.\n\nNatalie Boucly, a senior UNRWA official, said Israel is breaching international humanitarian law by maintaining restrictions. Boucly cited the Fourth Geneva Convention and a recent International Court of Justice ruling that found Israel must ensure Palestinians have “essential supplies of daily life”.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper  said  during a visit to aid warehouses in Jordan this month that Israel has “no excuse” for delaying humanitarian supplies.\n\nProfessor Mukesh Kapila of the University of Manchester said the restrictions represent deliberate strategy rather than logistical problems.\n\n“Accessing Gaza is one of the easiest regions where a humanitarian crisis is happening, so this is entirely a political act,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It is a deliberate Israeli strategy to keep up pressure on Hamas on the hostages and possibly disarmament, but it is compounding human suffering in Gaza.”\n\nThe Government Media Office statement called on United States President Donald Trump and mediator countries to the ceasefire to “take serious and immediate action to force the occupation to comply with what it signed” in the truce and humanitarian protocol.\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, at least 266 people have been killed since the truce began with Israeli forces carrying out strikes almost daily even in areas where troops were supposed to withdraw."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/syrian-fm-pledges-counter-terrorism-cooperation-with-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:24:03Z","title":"Syrian FM visits China, pledges ‘counterterrorism’ cooperation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024, Syria has embarked on a diplomatic revival, with Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani undertaking his first visit to China since the regime change.

Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani has pledged to deepen collaboration on “counterterrorism” with China on his first visit to Beijing since the toppling of former President  Bashar al-Assad  last year.\n\nAl-Shaibani and Chinese counterpart Wang Yi agreed on Monday that they would work together on combating “terrorism” and on security matters, with the top Syrian diplomat promising that Damascus would not allow its territory to be used for any actions against Chinese interests, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.\n\nChina, a former backer of al-Assad, said that it hoped Syria would take “effective measures” to fulfil its commitment, “thereby removing security obstacles to the stable development of China-Syria relations”, according to a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement.\n\nThe fate of the Uighur fighters who had gone to Syria after war erupted in 2011 to fight al-Assad’s forces, with many joining the Uighur-dominated Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) based in Idlib province, was expected to be on al-Shaibani’s agenda in Beijing.\n\nA source from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates in Damascus denied a report by news agency AFP that cited unidentified sources as saying the Syrian government planned to hand over 400 fighters who had fled persecution in China “in batches”.\n\nThe “report regarding the Syrian government’s intention to hand over fighters to China is without foundation”, said the source in a brief statement to SANA.\n\nDuring the meeting in Beijing, al-Shaibani also gave his country’s support for the one China principle, establishing formal diplomatic ties with the Chinese government, rather than with Taiwan, as the sole legal representative of the territory.\n\nWang, for his part, stated that China viewed the  Golan Heights  as Syrian territory. Israel occupied a portion of the territory in 1967 and subsequently annexed it in violation of international law.\n\nSince al-Assad’s fall in December 2024, Israel has been expanding its occupation into southern Syria, including a United Nations-monitored buffer zone established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement.\n\nOn Monday, Damascus and Beijing expressed interest in expanding collaboration on economic development, Syria’s reconstruction, and raising living standards, highlighting the role of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum as a basis for bilateral collaboration, said SANA.\n\nAl-Shaibani’s visit to China comes as Damascus pushes to rebuild its diplomatic ties around the world, with some stunning successes, including securing sanction relief from the West and major Gulf investments, giving the country a much-needed economic lifeline.\n\nEarlier this month, President  Ahmed al-Sharaa  became the first-ever Syrian leader to visit the White House since the country’s independence in 1946. Syria also joined a US-led international coalition to fight ISIL (ISIS).\n\nIn October, al-Sharaa told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin during a  visit to Moscow  that he sought to “restore and redefine ties” between the two countries.\n\nHowever, there was no mention after that meeting of whether Moscow would hand over al-Assad, who fled to Russia after his government fell due to an offensive by armed opposition groups led by al-Sharaa.\n\nSince the collapse of the al-Assad government, Russia has retained a presence at its air and naval bases on the Syrian coast. Moscow was one of al-Assad’s top backers and provided air support for government forces during the war.\n\nBut al-Shraa’s government appears to be prepared to forge relations with allies of the former regime, as highlighted by al-Shaibani’s talks in Beijing on Monday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/mothers-children-suffer-israels-engineered-starvation-in-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:45:33+00:00","title":"The mothers, children suffering Israel’s engineered starvation in Gaza","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the daily struggle of Israa Abu Reyala and her husband Mohammad in Gaza, where they face severe food shortages despite a ceasefire.

The mothers, children suffering Israel’s engineered starvation in Gaza\n\nDeir el-Balah, Gaza  – Every morning for Israa Abu Reyala and her husband, Mohammad, is a battle to find decent food for their five daughters, the youngest three of whom are triplets born during the war.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, which took effect about a month ago, has made little difference in the family’s daily life, Israa, 31, and Mohammad, 33, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The war was a nightmare,” Israa says as she feeds her little ones in her parents’ home in Deir el-Balah. “But the hardest part by far has been finding food, milk, and supplies for my three babies.”\n\nIsraa learned she was pregnant with triplets two months before the war.\n\n“We were planning for a third child, not three at once,” she laughs, exchanging a look with her husband.\n\nTheir concerns at the time – about income, rent, and how to manage three infants – feel like paradise now compared to what they lived through during the pregnancy and birth, they say.\n\nIsraa says her triplets, who are now 19 months old, don’t even know what an egg looks – much less tastes – like. They’ve eaten chicken a few times, but only when sharing meals with extended family.\n\nThe couple had high hopes for the  ceasefire that ostensibly ended Israel’s war on Gaza  and stipulated that Israel would allow food and aid supplies to enter the beleaguered enclave.\n\nBut instead of more and higher-quality food entering Gaza, they found little of nutritional value.\n\nMohammad says the markets are “stuffed with commercial goods” like biscuits, chocolate, candy, snacks, nuts, and canned foods, with few fruits and vegetables that enter at prices many can’t afford.\n\n“But what about the quality? What about proper food? And the prices are insane,” he adds.\n\n“Where are the eggs? Where is meat and poultry? Fresh dairy and cheese? Everything healthy, nutritious, or essential for children doesn’t exist, and if it does, it’s in tiny quantities and disappears instantly,” Israa says.\n\nHumanitarian officials call the state Israel has imposed on Gaza since it launched its genocidal war on it in October 2023, engineered starvation – a policy aimed at weakening the population physically and psychologically until society collapses from within.\n\nDr Khalil al-Degran, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that Israel has not adhered to humanitarian protocols requiring the entry of food and medical aid into Gaza, with quantities entering now “only 15 to 20 percent of actual needs”.\n\nHe adds that the products Israel allows in are nonessentials, like chips and instant noodles, which lack vital nutrients.\n\nMarkets remain empty of meat, poultry, dairy products, eggs, and most protein and fat sources, he says, calling it “clear engineered starvation”.\n\nIsraa says her girls are getting more to eat now, but she still worries because of the severe lack of nutritious food.\n\n“I’m worried about my health, too,” she says. “I did lab tests last month and the specialist told me I’m in the early stages of malnutrition.”\n\nTen-year-old Toleen says she will never forget the tanks and Israeli soldiers she had to walk past with her parents, hands up in the air, holding white flags.\n\nShe and her six-year-old sister, Jana, had fled with their parents from one displacement shelter to another for weeks before they fled south on foot through what Israel called “the safe corridor”.\n\nThey tried to stay in the north, leaving their home in Shati refugee camp for a UNRWA school in al-Nasr – but Israeli tanks kept advancing, and the family had to keep fleeing.\n\nSo one day in November 2023, they headed south to Israa’s parents’ home in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, where she spent the rest of her pregnancy and delivery, struggling with malnutrition and the fear of Israeli bombs.\n\nThey stayed there until a ceasefire in January this year, when they went back to Gaza City, only to be caught by a famine caused by Israel’s blocking of the entry of all aid supplies.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, two weeks before her scheduled caesarean section, she was woken up at night by labour pains, but the war was raging, with intense Israeli bombardment in nearby Nuseirat.\n\nMoving at night was dangerous, and they had to call the ambulance service repeatedly, telling them they were expecting triplets, before Israa was taken to al-Awda Hospital for an emergency c-section.\n\nHer daughters, Keraz, Kifah, and Jumana were born, one weighing two kilogrammes (4.4 pounds) and two weighing in at 1.9 kilogrammes (4.2 pounds), well within the average for healthy triplets.\n\n“Giving birth to healthy babies in a war felt like a miracle,” she says.\n\nDr al-Degran says most pregnant and breastfeeding women face acute anaemia caused by  a lack of food and supplements , with many giving birth prematurely or miscarrying.\n\nOnce home, the struggle to find baby formula, diapers, and clothes for the newborns began.\n\nThe triplets needed about one can of formula per day, which their severely malnourished mother had to supplement by breastfeeding them. Her health collapsed.\n\n“My body was exhausted and hungry,” Israa says.\n\n“These three … I cried as they cried from hunger,” she says, looking at her triplets playing nearby.\n\n“‘Nanna, nanna, nanna,’ that’s the sound they made asking for food, day and night. I can still hear it.”\n\nIsraa and her husband spiralled.\n\n“I used to escape into the street from my babies’ screams, walking aimlessly, crying for hours,” she says.\n\nAl-Degran says Gaza has suffered chronic malnutrition throughout Israel’s genocidal war on the enclave.\n\nHe warns that even if essential foods were allowed in today, the damage done to children, especially infants, has already left long-term physical and cognitive consequences.\n\nIsraa’s daily struggle continues, as she divides a single bite of food into three portions for her three infants.\n\n“This piece for one, this for the second, and this for the third … just so they quiet down a little. But then they start crying again. They don’t understand.

2025-11-17T16:06:43+00:00\n\nTitle: UK’s sweeping asylum law changes: How will they impact refugees?\n\nShabana Mahmood, the United Kingdom’s home secretary, has said the country’s asylum system is “not working” and is placing “intense strain on communities” ahead of proposals for  major government reforms  that would end refugees’ automatic right to settle permanently in the UK.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC on Sunday, Mahmood said undocumented migration is “tearing the country apart”.\n\nThe government’s proposals, to be unveiled on Monday, will have two main prongs. First, they would end the automatic path to settled status for refugees after five years. And second, they would remove state benefits from those who have the right to work and can support themselves.\n\nAfter a summer of fierce  protests outside hotels  housing asylum seekers and an  anti-immigration march  in London, Mahmood also announced new plans to curb small-boat crossings from France as well as to return refugees to their home countries once it is safe to do so.\n\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that net migration – the number of people entering a country minus the number leaving – had hovered around 200,000 to 300,000 people per year since 2011.\n\nHowever, after  Brexit was enacted in 2020 , there was a large increase in the number of undocumented immigrants entering the UK. Data from the ONS showed net migration climbed to  906,000  for the 12 months to June 2023.\n\nBut more recent figures showed those numbers have fallen dramatically since then. Net migration figures dropped by more than half in 2024 – to 431,000. This was largely owing to a decrease in the number of healthcare and student visas made available last year.\n\nMeanwhile, despite a UK media focus on people arriving in  small boats  from France, this group makes up a small share of the overall number of people entering the country. In 2024, for instance, the Home Office found that 36,816 people who arrived in the UK came via small boats.\n\nIn total, 108,138 people claimed asylum last year. Of those, only one-third came via small boats. As such, most claims for asylum went through formal channels (and included some dependants of those people).\n\nDespite the falling numbers,  disquiet with the ruling Labour Party remains rife . In an August YouGov poll, 38 percent of respondents said they believed  Reform UK , an anti-immigration party, would be more effective at handling asylum cases than Labour, who secured just 9 percent of the tally.\n\nOn Monday, the government is expected to announce a shift from permanent settlement for refugees to a temporary-protection model.\n\nCurrent rules stipulate that refugees granted asylum may remain in the UK for five years before being able to apply for an “indefinite leave to remain”, opening the door to citizenship.\n\nBut under the new plans, those who enter the UK through the asylum process could face up to 20 years before seeking permanent residency.\n\nIn addition, people granted asylum would have to renew their status every 30 months to see if the situation in their home country has changed such that UK residence is still required.\n\nMahmood said she intends to repeal the legal duty of the government to provide accommodation and basic financial support to all asylum seekers.\n\nThe government is expected to withdraw support from asylum seekers deemed able to work as well as from those people who commit offences, ignore removal orders or work illegally.\n\nAsylum seekers may currently apply for permission to work if their asylum claim has been outstanding for 12 months or more and if the delay is not considered their fault.\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council charity, said that instead of deterring migrants, the 20-year path to citizenship would “leave people in limbo and experiencing intense anxiety for many, many years”.\n\n“We need a system that is controlled and is fair, and the way you do that is you make decisions fairly, in a timely fashion, and if someone is found to be a refugee, they go on and they contribute to our communities and they pay back,” he told the programme BBC Breakfast on Sunday.\n\nMahmood’s proposal for 30-month checks implies that refugees could be sent back to their home countries once the government believes conditions on the ground have improved – an approach inspired by  Denmark’s much-debated policy .\n\nAlthough research by the Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook has found that deterrence has limited influence on where asylum seekers travel to, a 2017 study did suggest that Denmark’s “negative branding” had led to fewer  asylum applications.\n\nWhile Oxford University’s Migration Observatory said Mahmood’s overhaul would make the UK’s immigration system among the strictest countries in Europe, Matt Vickers, the opposition home office minister, said the government’s new plans to reform the asylum system contain “lots of gimmicks”.\n\nHe told the BBC that a “deterrent” is what is needed: “If people arrive in this country and know they’re going to get sent back, they won’t get in those boats in the first place.”\n\nThe government wants to introduce artificial intelligence-based assessments to determine the age of people who arrive without documentation. Ministers said errors in the current system risk placing adults in children’s services or wrongly treating minors as adults.\n\nRights groups, however, warned that automated systems could entrench bias, wrongly classify children as adults and expose them to harm.\n\nEarlier this year, Solomon told the BBC that he was “not convinced” that using AI tools was the government’s correct approach on age identification because he has  concerns about children being put in unsafe situations. He added that “these [AI] technologies continue to raise serious questions about accuracy, ethics and fairness.”\n\nThe Home Office has said visa applications from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be refused unless their governments improve collaboration with the UK regarding the deportation of their nationals.\n\nIn a statement, the department cited “unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive return procedures” as the reason for the potential penalty.\n\nIt said restrictions would apply “unless they agree to accept the return of their criminals and irregular migrants”.\n\nUK media are also reporting the government is set to limit how UK courts interpret the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in matters related to family life.\n\nArticle 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to a family and private life, will be reinterpreted “to better reflect the expectations of the British public”, the government is expected to say.\n\nThe new law would likely clarify that a “family connection” refers to immediate relatives only, such as a parent or child, and not to extended family members.\n\nAsked about Ukrainians fleeing  Russia’s invasion , Mahmood said they would continue to be admitted on a “bespoke scheme” but would also be expected to return once the war ends. She stressed that many arrivals from Ukraine have expressed a desire to return home.\n\nUnder the current scheme, Ukrainian refugees have the right to live in the UK for up to three years with access to healthcare, education and benefits. As these visas are temporary, Ukrainian nationals are largely exempt from the new 20‑year settlement rules for asylum seekers.\n\nApart from Ukrainians, vulnerable people from Afghanistan are provided with legal residence, access to work, education and healthcare through the UK’s Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme.\n\nIn addition, the British national overseas (BNO) visa allows Hong Kong BNO status holders and their dependents the right to live, work and study in the UK, providing a pathway to settlement and eventual citizenship.\n\nMahmood also told the BBC that new “safe and legal” avenues will be introduced to try to reduce the number of people attempting perilous crossings of the English Channel.\n\nOrganisations such as  Amnesty International  have repeatedly highlighted that restrictive policies and limited visa schemes leave many people with no option but to attempt illegal entry.\n\nAmnesty has called on Westminster to expand legal avenues – such as resettlement schemes, family reunification and community sponsorship – to reduce people smuggling and fatalities.\n\nOne option would be to allow individuals and charities in the UK to sponsor refugees, echoing the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which endows local communities with housing responsibilities.\n\nThe aim of these schemes, which would be for a limited number of people, is to give local areas more control to improve support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/trump-says-he-will-approve-sale-of-f-35-fighter-jet-to-saudi-arabia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:59:07Z","title":"Trump says he will approve sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced his approval of the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, marking a significant shift in U.S. defense policy and signaling deeper ties with Riyadh ahead of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit.

says he will approve sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia\n\nUnited States President  Donald Trump  says he will greenlight the sale of advanced F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, signalling a departure in how Washington handles sophisticated weapons transfers to Arab countries.\n\nTrump made the announcement on Monday at the White House, just one day before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to visit. “We’ll be selling F-35s,” the president told reporters, lauding Washington’s ties with Riyadh.\n\n“Yeah, I am planning on doing it. They want to buy them. They’ve been a great ally,” Trump said.\n\nThe decision marks a substantial win for Riyadh as Trump works to persuade Saudi Arabia to establish official ties with Israel as part of the  Abraham Accords .\n\nBut Saudi officials have repeatedly reasserted the kingdom’s commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions recognition of Israel on the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.\n\nThe potential arms deal between Washington and Riyadh raises questions about preserving Israel’s qualitative military edge, which is enshrined in US law. Some Israeli officials have already voiced opposition to the transfer of F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe US has a decades-old commitment of ensuring Israel retains superior military capabilities over potential regional adversaries.\n\nThe principle, first established under President Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and formally adopted by President Ronald Reagan, has guided American arms sales in the Middle East for more than four decades.\n\nEvery US administration since has pledged to preserve Israel’s ability to emerge victorious against any likely combination of regional forces.\n\nThe F-35, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is widely regarded as the world’s most advanced fighter jet, featuring technology that makes it difficult for enemy defences to detect.\n\nCritics in Israel have warned the sale could erode the country’s longstanding military superiority in the region.\n\nYair Golan, an opposition politician and former deputy chief of the Israeli army, said the move risked opening “an arms race in the Middle East” that could undermine advantages Israel has held for decades. He also blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government as being “failure-prone”.\n\n“The qualitative military edge, which has been the cornerstone of Israel’s security for many decades, is being squandered,” Golan said.\n\nIsraeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also said Israel must maintain its aerial superiority in the region.\n\n“We are in the Middle East – we cannot get confused. We extend a hand to anyone who truly wants to extend a hand and not harm the State of Israel, but we must preserve our superiority,” he told the Jewish News Syndicate on Monday.\n\nThe timing of Trump’s announcement, just before Prince Mohammed’s visit to the White House, underscores the US administration’s efforts to deepen ties with Riyadh as part of its broader Middle East strategy.\n\nWashington has historically managed concerns about Israel’s military edge by either downgrading weapons systems sold to Arab states or providing upgraded versions and additional equipment to Israel.\n\nPrince Mohammed’s visit comes as the shaky ceasefire in Gaza continues amid near-daily Israeli violations.\n\nOn Monday, when asked about a potential F-35 deal with Riyadh, Trump invoked the US attack on Iran in June, which he said “obliterated” the country’s nuclear facilities.\n\nSaudi Arabia was not involved in those strikes, but the kingdom’s official news agency, SPA, reported on Monday that Prince Mohammed received a handwritten letter from Iranian President  Masoud Pezeshkian  before his trip to Washington – without providing details about its content.\n\nIf the F-35 sale materialises, Saudi Arabia would become the first Arab country in the F-35 programme.\n\nIn 2020, Trump approved the sale of F-35 jets to the United Arab Emirates after Abu Dhabi agreed to establish formal ties with Israel.  But the deal  fell through after Joe Biden succeeded Trump in 2021 amid concerns by US lawmakers over the security of the technology.\n\nThe US Congress can disapprove weapon sales authorised by the president and his secretary of state."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/palestine-action-trial-begins-in-london-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:45:06+00:00","title":"Palestine Action trial begins in London – what we know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The trial of six members of the UK-based Palestine Action group begins at Woolwich Crown Court, marking a pivotal moment in a broader conflict over free speech, civil resistance, and national security.

Action, go on trial on Monday for allegedly damaging weapons at the UK base of Israeli defence firm  Elbit Systems  in August 2024.\n\nThe detainees, who are just some of a total of 24 activists linked to the group who have been arrested at different times, have been in custody for more than a year without trial, breaking the UK’s six-month pre-trial detention limit.\n\nTheir prosecution, which has drawn international scrutiny, has become a test case for how the British government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer is dealing with pro-Palestine demonstrations, with many UK residents and rights groups accusing authorities of heavy-handedness.\n\nThousands of people have demonstrated in support of the detained group, collectively known across the UK as the “Filton24”, named after the location of the targeted Elbit Systems offices in Filton, Bristol.\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks for demonstrating in solidarity with Palestine Action, which was banned under “anti-terror” laws in July.\n\nAt least 500 people, aged between 18 and 89, were detained at protests in London on October 4. Authorities said they had been arrested for “supporting a proscribed organisation”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the court case starting this week:\n\nSix Palestine Action members are being tried at Woolwich Crown Court in London. This is the first trial since the initial group of Filton24 members were arrested in August 2024, with others being arrested during subsequent police raids. All face charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder.\n\nThis week’s case focuses on the six defendants who were caught on the premises of Elbit Systems on August 6, 2024.\n\nAccording to the Free the Filton 24 group, formed by family and friends, they are: Zoe Rogers, Fatema Zainab (Ray) Rajwani, Jordan Devlin, Samuel Corner, and Charlotte “Lottie” Head. One other person has been identified by activist groups on social media only as “Ellie”. Most of the Filton24 appear to be UK citizens, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nOther members of Palestine Action may be tried later in relation to the Elbit Systems incident.\n\nThey include: Ian Sanders, Madeleine Norman, William Plastow, Leona Kamio, Hannah Davidson, Teuta “T”  Hoxha, ​​Zahra Farooque, Yulia Brigadirova, Qesser Zuhrah, Heba Muraisi, Kamran Ahmed, Amu Gib and Aleksandra Herbich.\n\nSean Middleborough, 32, who told local media he had been arrested in a violent raid on his home last November, was the only one to be granted temporary bail to attend his brother’s wedding in October. He reportedly failed to return to prison in early November as scheduled, and the police are now searching for him, according to Sky News.\n\nThe names of the remaining five arrested members of Palestine Action are unknown.\n\nFounded in July 2020 by activists Huda Ammori and Richard Barnard, Palestine Action describes itself as “a pro-Palestinian organisation which  disrupts the arms industry  in the United Kingdom with direct action”. The group has accused the UK government of complicity in Israeli war crimes in Gaza and says it is “committed to ending global participation in Israel’s genocidal and apartheid regime”.\n\nThe group’s members have targeted Israel-linked companies across the UK, spraying their facilities with trademark red paint. Members have also blocked entrances to buildings, chained themselves to infrastructure and damaged equipment.\n\nIn the wake of Israel’s war on Gaza, which began on October 7, 2023, the group’s demonstrations intensified. In October that year, its members targeted the BBC’s headquarters in London with red paint, in protest against the broadcaster’s perceived pro-Israel bias.\n\nIts members also blocked the facilities of weapons manufacturers Lockheed Martin, a US aerospace and defence group in London, and Leonardo, a defence and security group.\n\nOn August 6, 2024, Palestine Action’s members broke into the premises of the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Filton, Bristol, and reportedly destroyed quadcopter drones, which the group says are used by the Israeli military in Gaza to target Palestinians.\n\nThe action was estimated to have caused more than 1 million pounds ($1.3m) in damage, according to local news outlets. Six activists were arrested at the scene – the same who are on trial on Monday.\n\nFour others were arrested in connection with the Filton event in nationwide raids days after. Then, in November 2024, more raids saw the number of those arrested and held climb to 18. Later, in June 2025, a final raid led to six more people being arrested.\n\nThe detainees are being held in different prisons, including New Hall – for female and young offenders – located in West Yorkshire, and Pentonville in London. While they were initially held on charges of “terrorism”, those charges were later dropped, and all are now facing non-terror-related charges. According to the Free the Filton 24 group, formed by family and friends of the activists, nearly all the activists have been denied bail despite several applications.\n\nAt least six members began a hunger strike this month in protest against what they say is “systematic abuse” in the prisons, including wardens referring to them as “terrorists”, confiscating their clothing – including their Palestinian kefiyehs – and restricting their visits and letters. They include Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Jon Cink, Kamran Ahmed, Teuta “T” Hoxha and Qesser Zurah.\n\nThe group has vowed to refuse food until Elbit is shut down and prison authorities stop the alleged abuse.\n\nIn June 2025, the group announced that some of its members had cut through the outer fences of Brize Norton airbase in Oxfordshire, the largest station of the British Air Force, and sprayed red paint on the turbine engines of two Airbus Voyager aircraft.\n\nThe planes are used for air-to-air refuelling and have allegedly been used to refuel Israeli military fighter jets. The two activists involved used electric scooters to enter the compound and were able to escape unhindered.\n\nFive people were later arrested and charged on July 3, 2025, in relation to the Brize Norton action: Muhammad Umer Khalid, Amy Gardiner-Gibson, Jony Cink, Daniel Jeronymides-Norie and Lewie Chiaramello. All are being charged with conspiracy to enter a prohibited place and conspiracy to commit criminal damage.\n\nAnalysts at the time said the breach, while not posing a direct military threat, was embarrassing for the UK’s Ministry of Defence, as aircraft used by the king and prime minister are normally stationed there.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack, calling it “disgraceful”. The spraying reportedly cost the UK between 7 million and 30 million pounds ($9.2-$39m) in damage, according to police officials and various UK broadcasters, although the government told news site Declassified UK that it has not estimated a precise figure.\n\nBefore it intensified its demonstrations against Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the Palestine Action group’s members were also noted for:\n\nIn July, following the Brize Norton incident, the UK parliament  voted  overwhelmingly to proscribe Palestine Action as a “terrorist” group, making it a criminal offence to join or support the group, subject to a jail sentence of 14 years. That puts the group in the same category as armed groups, such as al-Qaeda.\n\nThe UK government said it proscribed Palestine Action for national security reasons. By doing so, “the government is demonstrating its zero tolerance approach to terrorism, regardless of its form or underlying ideology”, a statement read, adding that the group had orchestrated “aggressive and intimidatory attacks” against businesses, institutions, and the public in violation of the UK’s Terrorism Act of 2000.\n\n“National security is the government’s first priority, and it will not shy away from this responsibility,” the government’s statement read, adding that the right to “legitimate” protests will be protected.\n\nThe move has drawn widespread condemnation from pro-Palestine campaigners in the UK and rights groups. Hundreds of people marching in support of the group’s detained members, and condemning the proscription, have been arrested, according to the UK authorities.\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk warned days after the ban that the move represented a “misuse” of the country’s terrorism laws, as it was being applied to conduct that is not “terrorist” in nature – Palestine Action is not an armed group and its members have not killed or seriously injured anyone, nor have they threatened to do so.\n\nAmnesty International described the government’s move as “disturbing” and called on the UK to instead focus on taking action against Israel.\n\n“Instead of taking draconian measures to [proscribe Palestine Action], the Government should be taking immediate and unequivocal action to put a stop to Israel’s genocide and end any risk of UK complicity in it,” Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s chief executive, said.\n\nPalestine Action, meanwhile, argues that its actions are a form of civil resistance aimed at disabling weapons production.\n\nBREAKING: The government LOST their appeal and failed to stop the legal challenge of the Palestine Action ban.\n\nThat means the Judicial Review will go ahead on November 25-27th.\n\nNot only that, but we won TWO MORE grounds to argue the illegality of the ban.\n\nHuge victory.\n\n— Huda Ammori (@HudaAmmori)  October 17, 2025\n\nIn October, cofounder Huda Ammori was  granted permission  by a UK court to challenge the proscription on the grounds that it constitutes a disproportionate interference with free speech rights, after the UK government tried to block her appeal. The case is due to be heard between November 25 and 27."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe geomagnetic storm, classified as a G4 level by NOAA, is affecting Earth due to multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun.

have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-5912","dateOfPublication":"2024-06-25","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Experts (and a trivia buff) share tips to boost memory","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article offers science-backed strategies to improve everyday memory, such as remembering where keys are left.

Experts (and a trivia buff) share tips to boost memory \n         By Andee Tagle, Margaret Cirino \n        \n           Tuesday, June 25, 2024 • 4:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         You don't have to be a trivia buff to be great at remembering things. Monica Thieu , a four-time  Jeopardy!  contestant and winner of the game's 2012 college championship, uses memory techniques like mnemonic devices and flash cards to retain world capitals, TV shows, Olympic cities and more. \"With practice, absolutely everyone can make their memory stronger,\" says Thieu, who also researches memory, human cognition and emotion as a postdoctoral scientist at Emory University. Listen to the podcast episode:  Where did I put the keys? Tips to improve memory That's because memory is selective. What our brains choose to remember is something we can train, says  Charan Ranganath , director of the Dynamic Memory Lab at the University of California, Davis, and author of  Why We Remember . \"It can be biased, warped and reconstructed.\" If you want to improve your memory, even if it's just remembering where you parked or where you put your keys, try these science-backed strategies from our experts. Pay attention to what you want to remember \"The first necessary ingredient in creating a memory that lasts longer than the present moment is attention,\" says  Lisa Genova , a neuroscientist and the author of  Remember: The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting . \"We need that input — otherwise that memory doesn’t get made, even if your eyes see it.\" When people gripe about having memory problems, they're often having attention problems, she adds. For example, if you blame your memory because you can't find your parking spot, you probably weren't paying attention to it in the first place. So slow down and focus on what you want to remember. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Create a rule and a habit If you repeatedly lose track of an object like your keys, wallet or cellphone, pick a designated spot in your home and keep it there when it's not in use, says Genova. That way, you don't have to expend effort trying to remember where you placed it. \"If you put it in the same place every time, you've made it [a fact], sort of like your address and birthday: My keys always go in this bowl. There's a rule and a habit,\" she says. The more details the merrier To form memories you'll naturally keep, make them as immersive as possible, says Thieu. This is especially helpful when you're tackling a subject that you find difficult to connect with. Let's say you're trying to learn more about the Renaissance era. Commit the period to memory by absorbing information about it through a variety of mediums, says Thieu. Make a playlist of music from the era. Watch period dramas set at that time. And \"any time you have an opportunity to learn something in a richer way, do it\" — like going to a theater performance on the subject matter. Our brains love to remember anything that's \"meaningful, emotional, surprising or new,\" says Genova. So the more details you can give your brain to latch onto, the stronger that a memory becomes and the easier it is to recall later. For relationship advice (plus health, finance and parenting tips and more),  subscribe to Life Kit’s newsletter . Trigger your memory When your brain creates a memory, it naturally weaves together all the sights, sounds, tastes and smells associated with that memory, says Genova. So use those connections to your advantage. Let's say you're studying for a vocabulary test. If you always listen to Dua Lipa while you're studying and \"have a chance to listen to Dua Lipa while you take the test, it might help you remember those words,\" says Genova. Psychologists call this process \"context-dependent memory.\" Genova suggests enhancing your study space with smells, music or certain tastes. Try chewing a piece of cinnamon gum, for example, while you're preparing for a big exam — and then again while you're taking it. Your senses can act as triggers for the rest of your memory to fall into place. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Chunk\" long strings of information If you have a big load of information to recall at once, Ranganath suggests a strategy that researchers call \" chunking .\" It's a way to organize longer strings of information to make them easier to recall. Let's say you want to remember the phone number (130) 555-1212. \"That’s 10 digits, which is a lot to juggle around in my mind.\" So \"chunk\" it into three parts, he says: 130, 555, 1212. Instead of recalling each number individually, you can recall the entire group — and then retrieve each individual number more easily. Create a \"mind palace\" Need to remember to grab eggs, milk and coffee creamer from the store? Ranganath suggests a method that memory researchers, as well as memory champions, call a \"mind palace\" — or the  method of loci , which means \"places\" in Latin. You may have seen this ancient mnemonic device on TV shows like  Sherlock . This technique allows you to pair a place you know well, like your childhood home, with new information. Picture yourself placing the items of your grocery list around the house. Place a carton of eggs on your couch. Put milk on the kitchen counter. Put some creamer on the coffee table. Later on at the supermarket, recall this path through your house as you're shopping. It'll help you remember your grocery list. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Try good old flash cards Don't overlook the power of reviewing flash cards, says Thieu. \"Some of the best trivia experts I know do a lot of flash-carding.\" Thieu likes to watch old  Jeopardy!  reruns and create flash cards for the information in each episode. Then, she'll use the cards to quiz herself. She also uses this technique to drill lists of more specific trivia information — say, the world's longest rivers or deepest lakes. Take your flash-carding one step further by testing yourself  before  you learn the information, to see what you already know, and then afterward to see what you were able to remember. A pre-lesson test primes your brain for what you'll need to recall later on. \"We learn the most when we challenge ourselves  — and that's an extraordinarily powerful tool for retaining information in the long run,\" says Ranganath. Go easy on yourself Lastly, don't expect your memory to be perfect, say our experts. It's normal to occasionally misplace your keys or forget to pay a bill. \"Life is an open-book test,\" says Genova. You're not cheating if you look something up or write it down.

border\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has agreed to review a legal challenge against a controversial tactic called “metering”, which the federal government has used to turn away asylum seekers who arrive at its borders but are prevented from crossing.\n\nOn Monday, the justices granted a petition from the administration of President Donald Trump to review a lower court ruling that found “metering” to be an unlawful impediment to the asylum process.\n\nThe case, known as Al Otro Lado v Noem, had previously been weighed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, California. That court found that “metering” violated federal law granting non-citizens the right to apply for asylum in the US.\n\n“Metering” refers to the practice of turning away asylum seekers who arrive at official ports of entry into the US, on the basis that border officials are “at capacity”.\n\nAsylum seekers who were turned away were often left on the Mexican side of the southern border without safeguards or a timeline for when their asylum application would be accepted.\n\nA two-to-one majority on the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in 2024 that such action amounted to a “withholding” of asylum rights, rather than a simple delay.\n\nAl Otro Lado, the migration advocacy nonprofit that helped bring the case, said in a news release on Monday that it would “look forward to presenting [its] case” to the Supreme Court, which has a six-to-three conservative majority.\n\n“As the Ninth Circuit correctly concluded, our immigration laws require the government to inspect and process people seeking asylum at ports of entry and allow them to pursue their legal claims in the United States,” the advocacy group said in a statement.\n\n“The government’s turnback policy was an illegal scheme to circumvent these requirements by physically blocking asylum seekers arriving at ports of entry and preventing them from crossing the border to seek protection.”\n\nAl Otro Lado also argued that the “metering” policy left asylum seekers in dangerous conditions on the Mexican side of the border, where they could face extortion from criminal networks and corrupt officials alike.\n\n“Vulnerable families, children, and adults fleeing persecution were stranded in perilous conditions where they faced violent assault, kidnapping, and death,” it wrote.\n\nUS law allows individuals fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution to seek asylum within its borders. Protected groups include those facing violence for their race, religion, nationality, political leanings or membership in a particular social group.\n\nSuccessive administrations have long encouraged asylum seekers to present themselves at official ports of entry to file their claims, rather than crossing the border through irregular channels.\n\nAdvocates point out that “metering” appears to send the opposite message: that presenting yourself at an official port of entry could result in being turned away indefinitely.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, has sought to restrict asylum applications in general, and it has argued that “metering” is a necessary tool in preventing abuse within the asylum system.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration maintain that “metering” does not violate asylum laws because it applies to would-be applicants who have simply arrived at the border, but not crossed it.\n\n“Allied forces did not ‘arrive in’ Normandy while they were still crossing the English Channel,” the US Department of Justice said in its court filings, employing a World War II reference.\n\nIt also used a sports metaphor, comparing crossing the border to scoring a touchdown in American football. “A running back does not ‘arrive in’ the end zone when he is stopped at the one-yard line,” the Justice Department wrote.\n\nThe practice of “metering” began in 2016, when US officials at the border began turning away asylum seekers. The practice became formalised in 2018, with the federal government citing capacity issues amid a growing influx of arrivals.\n\nThe initial lawsuit was filed in 2017. In addition to Al Otro Lado, groups including the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies (CGRS), the Center for Constitutional Rights and the American Immigration Council have been among the groups representing 13 immigrants in the case.\n\n“Metering” was ultimately halted in 2021, under President Joe Biden, after a federal court struck down the practice. But legal proceedings over the tactic have since continued, and other restrictions on the asylum process have since been put in place.\n\nThe Trump administration’s defence of “metering” comes as part of a larger debate over its asylum policies.\n\nOn January 20, the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order effectively  banning asylum applications  at the southern US border.\n\nThat asylum ban has been subject to  a separate legal challenge . In July, US District Judge Randolph Moss  struck down the ban , saying that it effectively creates an “alternative immigration system” separate from the protections Congress has established.\n\nThe Trump administration has appealed that decision as well.\n\nWhile the asylum system was created, in large part, as a reaction to the widespread persecution that took place during the Holocaust and World War II, recent years have seen various governments seek to restrict asylum rights as part of a broader immigration crackdown.\n\nTrump, for instance, campaigned for a second term on a platform that sought to dramatically scale back immigration to the US.\n\nHis administration has since petitioned other countries to join its efforts to overhaul the asylum and refugee system. In September, for instance, a Trump official  held a panel  on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly entitled, “Global Refugee Asylum System: What Went Wrong and How to Fix It”.\n\nThen, a month later in October, the Trump administration unveiled the lowest-ever cap on refugee admissions in US history.\n\nOnly  7,500 refugees  would be allowed into the US in fiscal year 2026, according to a federal filing. Priority, it said, would be given to white Afrikaners from South Africa and “other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination”.\n\nCritics, however, have dismissed Trump’s claims of an anti-white “genocide” in South Africa  as false ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/unsc-approves-us-resolution-mandating-intl-stabilisation-force-in-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"22:42:20+00:00","title":"UN Security Council passes US resolution backing international Gaza force","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Security Council passed a 13-0 resolution, drafted by the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan, establishing a transitional administration and an International Stabilization Force in Gaza to promote Palestinian self-determination and statehood.

resolution mandating a transitional administration and an  International Stabilization Force  in Gaza that envisions a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe resolution, drafted by the United States as part of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan, passed in a 13-0 vote on Monday, paving the way for the crucial next steps for the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Russia and China abstained from the vote.\n\nArab and other Muslim countries that expressed interest in providing troops for an international force had previously indicated that a UN mandate was essential for their participation. At their behest, the US had included more defined language about Palestinian self-determination in the draft to get it over the finish line.\n\nThe draft now says “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” after the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-governance in the occupied West Bank, carries out reforms and advances are made in the redevelopment of Gaza.\n\nThat language angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to a Palestinian state and pledged to demilitarise Gaza “the easy way or the hard way”.\n\nIsraeli National Security Minister  Itamar Ben-Gvir  also rejected the measure, calling for the assassination of Palestinian Authority officials if the UN backs Palestinian statehood.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz said after the vote that the “resolution represents another significant step that will enable Gaza to prosper in an environment that will allow Israel to live in security”.\n\nAmar Bendjama, Algeria’s ambassador, said his country was grateful to Trump, “whose personal engagement has been instrumental in establishing and maintaining the ceasefire in Gaza”.\n\n“But we underline that genuine peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice, justice for the Palestinians who have waited for decades for the establishment of their independent state,” he said.\n\nThe US resolution says the stabilisation troops will help secure border areas along with a trained and vetted Palestinian police force and they will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. It says the force should closely consult and cooperate with neighbouring Egypt and Israel.\n\nIt also calls for the stabilisation force to ensure “the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip” and “the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”. The resolution authorises the force to “use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate”.\n\nHamas, which has not accepted disarmament, rejected the resolution, saying it failed to meet Palestinians’ rights and demands and sought to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.\n\n“Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the group said.\n\nThe resolution says Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza “based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarisation”, which would be agreed by the stabilisation force, Israeli forces, the US and the guarantors of the ceasefire.\n\nTrump said on his Truth Social platform that the international board of peace overseeing Gaza would “include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World” and thanked countries that “strongly backed the effort, including Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, The Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia , Indonesia, Turkiye, and Jordan”.\n\nRussia had circulated a rival resolution stressing that the  occupied West Bank  and Gaza must be joined as a contiguous state under the Palestinian Authority and underlining the importance of a Security Council role to provide security in Gaza and for implementing the ceasefire.\n\nReporting from New York, Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo said: “There is some certain criticism of [the US] draft resolution. A lot of people are saying that it simply changes the dynamics, but it still leaves Gaza essentially occupied, just by a different entity.”\n\nWashington and other governments had hoped Moscow would not use its veto power in the UN’s most powerful body to block the adoption of the US resolution.\n\nAl Jazeera’s senior political analyst, Marwan Bishara, said passage of the resolution is a “reflection of the imbalance of power on the ground in Gaza in favour of Israel and the imbalance of power in the Middle East in favour of the United States”.\n\nDespite the ceasefire that came into effect on October 10, Israel has continued to carry out deadly attacks in Gaza almost daily and to restrict humanitarian aid.\n\nIsrael’s brutal assault has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians in what leading rights groups have described as a genocide."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have recorded the most energetic flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, emitting light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at the age of 97.

a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-12-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-12:59","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including a severe G4 geomagnetic storm warning from the US weather agency, political misinformation claims by former President Trump about Tylenol and autism, Amazon's recent workforce reduction, Delhi’s experimental cloud seeding to reduce pollution, Nvidia’s global expansion amid US-China trade tensions, OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation post-capital deal, and breakthroughs in mRNA-based cancer vaccines.

Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93d08jg383o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"03:46:10.752+00:00","title":"Japan movie releases postponed in China after Taiwan row","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s controversial remarks in the Japanese parliament suggesting Japan could take military action if China attacked Taiwan, cultural tensions escalated.

space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/landslides-kill-dozens-as-heavy-rains-lash-southeast-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:57+00:00","title":"Landslides kill dozens as heavy rains lash Southeast Asia","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of people have been killed across Southeast Asia due to landslides triggered by heavy rains during the rainy season, with at least 18 fatalities in Indonesia’s Central Java and additional deaths in Banjarnegara and eastern Papua.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3eplgwdwdko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"22:52:18.501+00:00","title":"Will Trump's tariff rollback lower food prices?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump recently rolled back tariffs on over 200 products, including coffee, spices, and tropical fruits like bananas, in response to public concern over rising food prices and declining approval ratings.

President Donald Trump last week removed tariffs on more than 200 products, it represented something of a political earthquake, and marked a significant concession on a hallmark White House policy\n\nThe decision, which critics said was long overdue, came as the president returned his attention to cost-of-living issues, after polls suggested affordability concerns were weighing down White House approval ratings and hurting Republican candidates in recent elections.\n\nA top lobby group for the food industry, FMI, the Food Industry Association, hailed the tariff rollback, which affected popular items like bananas and coffee, as a \"critical step\" toward affordability, as other business groups also praised the move.\n\nBut in the end, the practical relief may not feel as monumental as the political gesture.\n\nIn October, the Budget Lab at Yale projected that Trump's tariffs this year - currently a baseline tax of 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would drive up food prices 1.9% in the short run.\n\nThe impact would be significant, given that US grocery prices historically have been relatively stable, rising an average of only 2% a year between 2013 and 2021.\n\nThe White House order did not eliminate tariffs on all food, but it removed levies on some items, such as coffee, spices and tropical fruit like bananas, for which US production is negligible or non-existent.\n\nFor those kinds of goods, economists and businesses said they expected the order would help bring down prices - and relatively quickly.\n\nAnthony Serafino, president of the New Jersey-based fruit importer and distributor EXP Group, said he expected to drop his prices in the coming weeks, after raising them earlier this year to cover millions of dollars in new tariff costs.\n\nHe said it might take a few weeks for shoppers to see the difference, since he has to sell items he brought in before the change. But he expected the decision to be a \"big help\".\n\n\"We were just passing through costs. We're not going to keep prices elevated just to keep prices elevated,\" he said.\n\nThe overall impact on household grocery budgets, however, may still end up feeling relatively modest.\n\nThough the US is heavily dependent on foreign supplies in certain categories, such as fresh fruit and seafood, imports typically account for less than 20% of overall food and beverage purchases by Americans, according to USDA.\n\nAnd many food imports from Mexico - America's single biggest foreign food supplier - were already spared tariffs, due to White House exemptions for goods covered by a US, Mexico and Canada free trade agreement.\n\n\"You will certainly see it on certain products,\" said Sean Cash, a professor of food economics at Tufts University.  \"I don't think we're going to see a lot in terms of the average price of groceries coming down.\"\n\nFood companies are still facing higher costs from tariffs on materials like aluminium, used to make canned foods; items like wine, cheese and palm oil did not make the list.\n\nRecent jumps in food prices also reflect factors unrelated to tariffs, like rising labour costs and droughts, which hit coffee and cattle supplies.\n\n\"If we got rid of trade barriers on food items and food commodities, would that make food cheaper in the US? Yes, a little bit, but not that much, because most of what we're buying are services,\" said Daniel Sumner, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis, noting costs like border inspections, washing, trucking fees and supermarket workers.\n\nOverall, grocery prices climbed 2.7% over the 12 months to September.\n\nThat is still significantly lower than the huge jumps in 2022 and 2023, when grocery prices surged 11.4% and 5% respectively.\n\nTrump administration officials have cast high food prices as a mess they inherited from the Biden administration, and warned it will take time to correct the problem.\n\nIn a briefing for reporters last week about new tariff exemptions, they acknowledged the effects might be limited, saying reducing prices in grocery aisles was the goal and not a guarantee.\n\nWalmart, Target and Kroger did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFood prices tend to fluctuate more than other kinds of goods, meaning some relief is likely, especially given attention on the issue, economists said.\n\nBut Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Canada, warned today's high prices are likely to inform future decisions, comparing the dynamic to the \"tide\".\n\n\"The tide goes up, it leaves a mark on the dock and that line remains,\" he said. \"If tariffs disappear, you will see that mental mark remaining and industry tends to work with that mark.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"22:46:15.468+00:00","title":"What does Trump want with boat strikes near Venezuela and Caribbean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, the US launched a sustained campaign of airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, dubbed Operation Southern Spear, targeting vessels allegedly involved in drug trafficking.

continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear.\n\nTens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nOn Sunday the US military confirmed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, had arrived in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Trump administration argues the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US.\n\nThey have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region.\n\nPresident Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets.\n\nIn a statement, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nIn at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nIt is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.\n\nThe US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.\n\nBBC Verify has identified 15 warships in the region based on ship-tracking data, satellite imagery and announcements by US authorities.\n\nThis includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, described by the US Navy as \"the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world\".\n\nThe deployment also includes a range of guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nAdditionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline.\n\nTrump has also acknowledged that he authorised  the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.\n\nBetween 2 September and 16 November, US forces hit at least 22 vessels in 21 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nUS Southern Command announced on Sunday that its latest strike, conducted on Saturday in eastern Pacific international waters, killed three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board.\n\n\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Southern Command wrote in a post on X, alongside a video showing the boat exploding in a massive fireball.\n\nCollectively, at least 83 people have been killed.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nOne investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nIn a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".\n\nBut some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that  he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity .\n\nCritics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.\n\nAccording to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.\n\nIn October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\n\n\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"\n\nThe build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially to try to topple the left-wing socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nOn 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\nMaduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace.\n\n\"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Edgington"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q1z80n8qdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"01:44:02.796+00:00","title":"Federal agents arrest 130 in Charlotte immigration crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal immigration agents arrested 130 people in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a two-day operation dubbed 'Operation Charlotte's Web', marking the city as the latest target of President Donald Trump’s nationwide crackdown on immigration.

Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.\n\nIncluded   in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute.\n\nThe resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained.\n\nAdopting it was an \"important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire,\" a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands.\n\nWriting on Telegram after the resolution passed, Hamas said the plan, \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject\".\n\n\"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added.\n\nUnder the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.\n\nUntil now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.\n\nMike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the Council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarization of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\".\n\nThe Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n\nFinancing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution.\n\nUnder the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force.\n\nTrump called the Security Council vote \"historic\" and said it was a way of \"acknowledging and endorsing\" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair it.\n\n\"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nUnlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for.\n\nIsrael strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to \"translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground\" and lead to \"a political process for the achievement of the two-State solution\".\n\nThe US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented \"urgently and immediately\".\n\nRussia and China did not exercise their vetoes, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it.\n\nBoth Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution.\n\nThe initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\".\n\nTrump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas which had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.\n\nMore than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8glerlyrgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"02:55:31.961+00:00","title":"Americans survived one government shutdown and brace for another","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a 43-day government shutdown in the United States, the longest in history, which left millions of Americans—particularly military families and low-income individuals relying on federal benefits—living in financial and emotional uncertainty.

picking up and moving her family every three years.\n\nThe crippling anxiety that comes with a US government shutdown, however, is not something she is used to.\n\nShe is one of the millions of Americans who sighed a deep breath of relief when politicians in Washington agreed to reopen the government earlier this week.\n\nAt 43 days, it was the longest shutdown in US history.\n\nBut that relief could be short-lived, as the funding agreement expires at the end of January, when Congress will face the same spending challenge once again.\n\n\"It really affects every part of your life when your family’s sole source of income comes from the federal government,” Ms Johnson said. \"The uncertainty is crippling.\"\n\nThe Tennessee mother of two has lived in seven states since her husband joined the military nearly 20 years ago.\n\nPicking up and moving her family every three years means it is tough for her - and other service members' spouses - to get work, so the Johnson family lives on one paycheque.\n\nNot knowing whether or not military service members would receive their paycheques from the shuttered government left her family with difficult decisions.\n\nSome 1.3 million active-duty personnel are required to serve during government shutdowns potentially without pay, but the Trump administration stepped in twice during the autumn shutdown to reallocate funds for those servicemembers.\n\nBut without certainty, many families had to tighten their belts. One of Ms Johnson’s sons even offered to get fewer Christmas Gifts - “it’s ok we don’t need them,” he said to his mother.\n\nMs Johnson is frustrated by what she described as unnecessary sacrifice from millions of Americans.\n\n“What was it all for? Why were we suffering for over 40 days in uncertainty, not knowing what was going to happen,\" she questioned. \"What was the point? We’re just going to go through this again probably in January.”\n\nThe agreement Congress made this week funds the government for the next two months, guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - which provides food aid to one in eight Americans - until next September.\n\nSierra Bird is one of the more than 42 million Americans who depend on funds from Snap to feed her family.\n\nThe Florida mother of four gets about $900 a month, but those funds were delayed because they were caught up in the spending bill.\n\nMs Bird said she \"survived\" the shutdown and her Snap card will be reloaded over the weekend.\n\nShe'll return to some sense of normal, but she's also weary another shutdown could be on the horizon and she said she would start stockpiling food, just in case.\n\n\"People are going to take what they need if they don't have what they need,\" Ms Bird said. \"Don't mess with people's food.\"\n\nWhile Snap benefits have resumed, one thing that hasn't come back is health-insurance subsidies. It was those subsidies that Democrats had said they were willing to fight for, which helped fuel the shutdown in the first place.\n\nDemocrats had said they would not approve the budget unless the subsidies continued. But on Tuesday, eight Democrats sided with Republicans to approve a spending plan without them.\n\n\"I swapped one stress for another,\" Ms Bird said. \"I would rather have the affordable healthcare than Snap, because I can feed them rice and beans and survive, but I need my medications.\"\n\nIn addition to those struggling to put food on the table during the shutdown, more than 1.4 million federal employees went without pay for 43 days.\n\nSarah, a Utah Interior Department employee who asked her last name not be used, was among them.\n\nShe was furloughed from the start of the shutdown on 1 October and as the days and weeks went by she worried she would have to find another way to make money.\n\n\"I was trying to decide if I wanted to give up the federal sector altogether to find another career,\" Sarah said.\n\nAs an archaeologist, she works in a unique, specialised role, making it hard to transfer her expertise to another job or industry.\n\nHer worries were quelled on Thursday when she returned to work for the first time in weeks, following the government's reopening, but she is already preparing for the prospect of another one come January.\n\n\"With the holidays coming up, I'm not going to spending a whole lot of money,\" she said, noting she is putting off certain remodelling projects too.\n\n\"I would not be the least bit surprised if another shutdown happened.\"\n\nIn the less than 80 days until the next potential government shutdown, Ms Johnson, the military wife, said she would be preparing, just in case.\n\n\"We're making a huge effort to watch unnecessary spending and save money where we can so we have a bigger nest egg built up because if the government shuts down again in January there's no guarantee that active duty military is going to get paid.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump's announcement to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing, with the U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarifying that the planned tests are noncritical and do not involve nuclear explosions.

2025-11-03T12:27:39+00:00\n\nTitle: How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l1zxekp3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"00:18:39.700+00:00","title":"This phone habit might be ruining your relationship.

Here's how to stop it\n\nWe all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.\n\nThat's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone -creeps into everyday moments.\n\nThis can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.\n\nRather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.\n\nDr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.\n\nEvery time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage.\n\nIt sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehr says this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or \"Just quickly look something up\" without thinking.\n\nWhat matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: \"I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.\"\n\nBy naming it - \"I need to check my train times\" or \"I'm replying to my mum\" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter.\n\n\"It stops the other person feeling ignored,\" Dr Regehr says.\n\n\"And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.\"\n\nDoing this could help improve your relationships too.\n\nDr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton,  led a study  which involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be.\n\n\"Not everyone reacts in the same way,\" Dr Hart says. \"It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation.\n\n\"They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.\"\n\nEvery time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"23:01:18.831+00:00","title":"A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Chinese firm, Fosun Group, acquired Wright USA, a U.S. insurer that provided coverage to FBI and CIA agents, in 2015.

2025-11-17T23:01:18.831+00:00\n\nTitle: A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree\n\nSince 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications.\n\nBut the rules weren't always so strict.\n\nIn 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity.\n\n\"Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'\" he remembers. \"I was astonished!\"\n\nIn 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership.\n\nUS concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned.\n\nWright USA wasn't an isolated case.\n\nThe BBC has exclusive early access to brand new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.\n\nIn the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret.\n\nBut on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: \"There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.\"\n\nThe Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA.\n\nStein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale.\n\nFosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nHigh-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018.\n\nVery few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent.\n\n\"For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,\" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \"And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.\"\n\nAidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China.\n\nA four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the first known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world. The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access.\n\nAidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries.\n\n\"China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,\" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds.\n\nThat size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities.\n\n\"The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,\" Mr Shih says. \"This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.\"\n\nSome of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025.\n\nIn it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year.\n\nBeijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China.\n\nGlobal alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it \"stayed very much alive\" as a guiding strategy.\n\n\"There are all kinds of plans still being published,\" he says, \"including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.\"\n\nAt a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating \"high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement\" until 2030.\n\nAidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how  the Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company .\n\nThe United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA.\n\nAidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy.\n\n\"At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,\" he says. \"I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.\"\n\nHowever, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts.\n\n\"The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,\" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC.\n\n\"Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.\"\n\nChina's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment.\n\nIn the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company.\n\nIt shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech.\n\nNexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company.\n\nThat bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing.\n\nNexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions.\n\nThe company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets.\n\nXioaxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past.\n\n\"We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,\" she says. \"Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.\"\n\nXiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China.\n\n\"There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,\" she says.\n\n\"Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.\"\n\nIf China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over?\n\n\"No! There's gonna be multiple laps,\" maintains Brad Parks. \"There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital.\n\n\"So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot.\n\n\"They're going to move from defence to offence.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50nvq8znvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"01:54:37.368+00:00","title":"When is the Epstein files vote - and why does Trump now say he wants them released?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has reversed his prior opposition to releasing documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, urging Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of a House bill that would require the Justice Department to make all Epstein-related files—potentially including those involving Ghislaine Maxwell and other individuals—publicly available within 30 days.

urged Republicans in Congress to vote to release more files relating to Jeffrey Epstein - a sudden reversal in his position after having previously opposed efforts to make the documents public.\n\nTrump had been facing a potential revolt this week after a growing number of Republicans signalled they would vote in favour of releasing the files despite his opposition.\n\nWhile the measure is likely to pass in the House of Representatives, it is far from certain that it would pass in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nAnd even if it does pass in the Senate, it remains unclear when the files could be released and whether they would satisfy ardent campaigners.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on a measure that would compel the justice department to make publicly available \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" all files pertaining to Epstein within 30 days.\n\nProcedural votes and debates are expected to begin at 10:00EST (15:00GMT) and continue for many hours.\n\nSeveral victims of Epstein are also expected to spend the day on Capitol Hill, to advocate for the bill's passage and to hold news conferences with reporters.\n\nThe releases could, in theory, also include files pertaining to imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as people - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents.\n\nThe vote will come just  two days after Trump wrote on Truth Social to encourage Republicans to vote for the measure . In the post, he argued that \"we have nothing to hide\".\n\nThe measure is likely to pass. Even before Trump's post, some House Republicans had made clear they were willing to break ranks with the president and House Speaker Mike Johnson to vote in favour.\n\nShould it pass, it still faces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is under no obligation to even pick up the measure.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune will do so - but the Republican is under enormous pressure from both sides of the US political spectrum.\n\nHe had previously suggested that while he was \"not hearing\" much desire from fellow Republicans to push for the release of the documents, a successful House vote could change that.\n\n\"I just hope John Thune will do the right thing,\" Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie told ABC News over the weekend.\n\nAnother Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, only told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the Senate will \"take a look\" at the bill if it passes the House.\n\n\"We'll see what it says,\" Barrasso said. \"We all want accountability and transparency. But to me, this it not about the truth. It's not about justice.\"\n\n\"This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame-duck president,\" he added. \"And I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\"\n\nOnly after the Senate passes the bill would it head to President Trump, who has said he would sign it into law.\n\nThere are, however, obstacles to the files being released even if he does so.\n\nThe text of the document that will go before the House, for example, notes that the Attorney General could withhold or redact portions of records that contain personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\n\n\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\n\n\"There may also be some issues about law enforcement techniques that the justice department might not want to be out there in the public domain,\" he added.\n\nThe proposed House bill also notes that the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\".\n\nThat could potentially lead to delays, given that President Trump said in his post that he would be calling for an investigation into Epstein's alleged links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton and Larry Summers \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\n\n\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Prof Entin said. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\"\n\nDoing so, he added, \"might create some prejudicial publicity about targets of the investigation\" that could ultimately lead to intense litigation if any indictments are brought.\n\nFor those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.\n\n\"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,\" Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican now in a public row with Trump over the files, told CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"I have no idea what's in the files. I can't even guess,\" Greene added. \"But that is the question everyone is asking is - why fight this so hard?\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0el0vg8mno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"22:26:59.395+00:00","title":"James Comey: Judge says government 'missteps' may have tainted case against ex-FBI boss","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. federal judge has ruled that 'investigative missteps' and 'government misconduct' by the Justice Department may have tainted the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey, who was charged by President Donald Trump after being targeted for his role in the 2016 Russian election interference investigation.

federal judge says \"investigative missteps\" and \"government misconduct\" may have tainted the Trump administration's criminal case against former FBI director James Comey.\n\nIn a 24-page opinion, Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered justice department lawyers to release grand jury materials,  including transcripts and evidence, to Comey's defence team. The justice department has appealed against the order.\n\nComey was charged in September after President Donald Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case.\n\nComey, who has long drawn Trump's  ire, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include obstructing a congressional investigation.\n\nThe former FBI chief was fired by Trump during his first term, after Comey led an investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Since then, Comey has been a frequent target of the two-term US president.\n\nComey was accused of lying to lawmakers during a congressional hearing in 2020 about his Russian election interference investigation.\n\nAfter other federal prosecutors had reportedly declined to pursue the case against Comey, citing lack of evidence, Trump tapped Lindsey Halligan as the lead prosecutor in the case.

Many states have similar laws, which say people are not required to retreat before using deadly force when they are threatened.\n\nBoone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood said in a news conference on Monday that state law did not allow for Mr Andersen to open fire.\n\n\"Based upon the particular evidence and circumstances of this case, we have determined that Curt Andersen's actions do not fall within the legal protections provided by the Indiana 'stand your ground' law,\" Eastwood said.\n\nHe added that the suspect \"did not have the proper information which would allow him to make the determination that he was reasonable in his actions\".\n\nAuthorities responded to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown early on the morning of 5 November.\n\nMrs Perez was found dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of the home shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT), according to police.\n\nPolice say the cleaners did not appear to have entered the home.\n\nShe leaves behind four children, including an infant who is about to turn one-year-old. Her husband says he is trying to bring her body back to her native Guatemala for burial.\n\nStand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.\n\nSimilar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing.\n\nIn New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3ee303yxpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:43:38.178+00:00","title":"Sheikh Hasina: Bangladesh's pro-democracy icon who became an autocrat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister and a former pro-democracy icon, was ousted in August 2024 after a violent student-led uprising that resulted in over 1,400 deaths, with security forces using lethal force against protesters.

autocrat\n\nBangladesh's longest-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed began her political career as a pro-democracy icon, but fled mass protests against her rule in August 2024 after 15 years in power.\n\nSince then, Hasina has been in self-imposed exile in India, where she flew after being deposed by the student-led uprising which spiralled into nationwide unrest.\n\nOn 17 November, a special tribunal in Dhaka sentenced her to death after convicting her of crimes against humanity. It was found Hasina had ordered a deadly crackdown on protesters between 15 July and 5 August 2024. She denied all charges against her.\n\nUp to 1,400 people were killed during the weeks of protests leading up to her ousting, most by gunfire from security forces, UN human rights investigators said. Their report found that  she and her government had tried to cling to power using systematic, deadly violence  against protesters.\n\nIt was the worst bloodshed the country had seen since independence in 1971.\n\nThe protests brought an unexpected end to the reign of Hasina, who had ruled Bangladesh for more than 20 years.\n\nShe and her Awami League party were credited with overseeing the South Asian country's economic progress. But in recent years she was accused of turning autocratic and clamping down on any opposition to her rule.\n\nPolitically-motivated arrests, disappearances, extra-judicial killings and other abuses all rose under her rule.\n\nIn January 2024, Hasina won an unprecedented fourth term as prime minister in an election  widely decried by critics  as being a sham and boycotted by the main opposition.\n\nProtests began later that year with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs. By summer they had morphed into a wider anti-government movement as she used the police to violently crack down on protesters.\n\nAmid increasing calls for her to resign, Hasina remained defiant and condemned the agitators as “terrorists”. She also threw hundreds of people into jail and brought criminal charges against hundreds more.\n\nA leaked audio clip suggested she had ordered security forces to  \"use lethal weapons\"  against protesters. She denies ever issuing an order to fire on unarmed civilians.\n\nSome of the bloodiest scenes  occurred on 5 August, the day Hasina fled by helicopter before crowds stormed her residence in Dhaka. Police killed at least 52 people that day in a busy neighbourhood, making it one of the worst cases of police violence in the country's history.\n\nHasina, who has been tried in absentia, called the tribunal a \"farce\".\n\n\"It is a kangaroo court controlled by my political opponents to deliver a pre-ordained guilty verdict... and to distract the world's attention from the chaos, violence and misrule of [the new] government,\" she told the BBC in the week before her verdict.\n\nShe called for the ban on her party to be lifted before elections due in February.\n\nHasina is also charged with crimes against humanity relating to forced disappearances during the Awami League's rule in another case at the same tribunal in Bangladesh. Hasina and the Awami League deny all the charges.\n\nHasina and other senior members of her former government are also facing trial for corruption in a separate court - charges they deny.\n\nBorn to a Muslim family in East Bengal in 1947, Hasina had politics in her blood.\n\nHer father was the nationalist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's \"Father of the Nation\" who led the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971 and became its first president.\n\nAt that time, Hasina had already established a reputation as a student leader at Dhaka University.\n\nHer father was assassinated with most of his family members in a military coup in 1975. Only Hasina and her younger sister survived as they were travelling abroad at the time.\n\nAfter living in exile in India, Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and became the leader of the Awami League, the political party her father belonged to.\n\nShe joined hands with other political parties to hold pro-democracy street protests during the military rule of General Hussain Muhammed Ershad. Propelled by the popular uprising, Hasina quickly became a national icon.\n\nShe was first elected to power in 1996. She earned credit for signing a water-sharing deal with India and a peace deal with tribal insurgents in the south-east of the country.\n\nBut at the same time, her government was criticised for numerous allegedly corrupt business deals and for being too subservient to India.\n\nShe later lost to her former ally-turned-nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, in 2001.\n\nAs heirs to political dynasties, both women have dominated Bangladesh politics for more than three decades and used to be known as the \"battling begums\". Begum refers to a Muslim woman of high rank.\n\nObservers say their bitter rivalry resulted in bus bombs, disappearances and extrajudicial killings becoming regular occurrences.\n\nHasina eventually came back to power in 2009 in polls held under a caretaker government.\n\nA true political survivor, she endured numerous arrests while in opposition as well as several assassination attempts, including one in 2004 that damaged her hearing. She has also survived efforts to force her into exile and numerous court cases in which she has been accused of corruption.\n\nOnce one of the world's poorest nations, Bangladesh achieved credible economic success under her leadership from 2009.\n\nIts per capita income tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years.\n\nMuch of this growth has been fuelled by the garment industry, which accounts for the vast majority of total exports from Bangladesh and has expanded rapidly in recent decades, supplying markets in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nUsing the country's own funds, loans and development assistance, Hasina's government also undertook huge infrastructure projects, including the flagship $2.9bn Padma bridge across the Ganges.\n\nBut Hasina has long been accused of enacting repressive authoritarian measures against her political opponents, detractors and the media - a remarkable turnaround for a leader who once fought for multi-party democracy.\n\nRights groups estimate there have been at least 700 cases of enforced disappearances, with hundreds more subject to extra-judicial killings, since Hasina took power again in 2009. Hasina denies involvement in these.\n\nBangladesh's security forces have also been accused of serious abuses. In 2021, the US sanctioned its Rapid Action Battalion - a notorious police unit accused of carrying out numerous extra-judicial killings - citing human rights violations.\n\nHuman rights activists and journalists also faced increasing attacks including arrests, surveillance and harassment.\n\nHasina's government was also accused of \"judicially harassing\" targets with court cases, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus - who became head of the interim government after Hasina fled. He had been  jailed earlier in 2024  and faced more than 100 charges, in cases his supporters say were politically motivated.\n\nHasina's government flatly denied claims of such abuses,   while also restricting visits when it was in power by foreign journalists seeking to investigate the allegations.\n\nThe protests against civil service quotas, which sparked last year's uprising,   came as Bangladesh struggled with the escalating costs of living in the wake of the pandemic. Inflation skyrocketed, the country's foreign exchange reserves dropped precipitously, and its foreign debt doubled since 2016.\n\nCritics blamed this on mismanagement by Hasina's government, claiming that Bangladesh's economic progress only helped those close to her."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v336lyz4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:51:25.793+00:00","title":"New international student enrolment drops 17% at US universities","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 17% drop in first-time international student enrolment at US universities in autumn 2025 has been reported by the Institute of International Education, with visa-related issues—such as delays, denials, and stricter screening including social media checks—identified as primary causes.

autumn compared to previous years, research released on Monday indicates.\n\nThe drop comes as the Trump administration has made it more difficult to obtain student visas, with the research suggesting visa application issues like delays and denials are among the top reasons for the decline in first-time students.\n\nThe survey found a modest overall 1% decline in international students when taking into account students who have been in the US for years.\n\nForeign students make up about 6% of total US enrollment and contributed $55bn (£41bn) to the economy, according to 2024 figures from the commerce department.\n\nThe survey by  the Institute of International Education examined the population of international students at 828 higher education institutions.\n\n\"There are warning signs for future years, and I'm really concerned about what this portends for fall '26 and '27,\" Clay Harmon, executive director of AIRC: The Association of International Enrollment Management, told the Associated Press.\n\nThe 17% decline in first-time students is lower than one forecast over the summer by NAFSA, a non-profit international educators group, which had estimated a potential 30%-40% drop this autumn due to visa issues.\n\nSome 84% of universities told the Institute of International Education they consider foreign student recruitment a priority.\n\nMany schools said they are providing flexibility to students who have faced hurdles in beginning their studies in the US, including deferrals which saw a 39% increase compared to the 2024 survey.\n\nUS institutions told the report researchers there were a number of factors driving a decline in new students, including visa issues, travel restrictions that effect about 2% of the foreign student population, and some \"student concerns about feeling unwelcome in the United States\".\n\nThe White House has made a number of moves that have limited the number of foreign students, most who pay higher tuition rates, in the US.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration paused scheduling visa appointments for international students. In June, when those resumed, the administration announced it would screen visa applications more closely, including by asking all applicants to allow their social media accounts to be checked.\n\nThat policy came in the wake of large pro-Palestine protests on many college campuses.\n\nBefore that, the State Department  revoked more than 6,000 international student visas  because of violations of US law including assault, driving under the influence (DUI), and \"support for terrorism\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged the importance of foreign students to the economy and as a source of income for higher education.\n\nIn September, he said he plans to issue 600,000 Chinese student visas - about double the current number - despite concern from some of his supporters over national security.\n\n\"You know, the students pay more than double when they come in from most foreign countries,\" Trump said on Fox News last week.\n\n\"I want to see our school system thrive.

He was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and is currently a professor there.\n\nIn Summers' statement on Monday night, he said he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\n\n\"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" he said.\n\nThe Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, announced on its website on Monday that he is no longer affiliated with the center.\n\nThe emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".\n\nIn a separate email just after US President Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".\n\nDue to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", Putin \"proximity\", and \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".\n\nA representative for Summers previously told US media that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\" in 2008 for soliciting an underage prostitute.\n\nThe emails include many high-profile figures. A review by The Wall Street Journal found that Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. While he was discussed in some  messages released last week, he did not send or receive them."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993evxk24jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"00:03:52.347+00:00","title":"US will give visa appointment priority to World Cup ticket holders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced that U.S. embassies will prioritize visa appointment interviews for foreign nationals holding tickets to the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Appointment Scheduling System (Pass) will \"allow World Cup ticket-holders with long wait times to opt with Fifa for a prioritised interview,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday.\n\nTicket-holders for the tournament - set for next June and July in the US, Canada and Mexico - will not be automatically granted a tourist visa, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nBut foreign nationals with tickets to World Cup football matches could get an interview at an embassy or consulate within six to eight weeks of applying, Rubio said.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa; it

The only difference here is we're moving them up in the queue.\"\n\nThe 2026 men's World Cup will be co-hosted across North America, with Mexico and Canada, with most matches played in the United States.\n\nSpeaking in the Oval Office with Trump and Rubio, Fifa President Gianni Infantino said up to 10 million visitors could come to the US to watch World Cup matches.\n\n\"With this Fifa Pass, we can make sure that those who buy a ticket, that are legitimate football fans or soccer fans, they can come and attend the World Cup in the best conditions, starting from getting their visa,\" he said.\n\nSome countries whose national teams have already qualified for next year's tournament currently have long wait times for visa appointments.\n\nIn Colombia, travellers applying for US visas are currently waiting around 11 months for an interview appointment, according to data published by the US State Department, the agency which processes visa applications.\n\nThe average wait time in Mexico City is nine and half months, while non-Canadian citizen residents of Toronto can expect a wait of 14 months for appointments.\n\nIf those wait times hold, the World Cup will have already been played and the golden trophy already awarded by the time fans from some countries have their visas approved or denied.\n\nMonday's announcement was lauded by US Travel Association, a tourism industry trade group. \"The expedited process for Fifa ticket-holders adds needed efficiency without sacrificing security,\" its CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement.\n\n\"This is the kind of practical action that strengthens security, increases capacity and cuts wait times, putting the U.S. on stronger footing to welcome millions of visitors next year.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the new appointment rules will cover ticket-holders from countries whose citizens are mostly or entirely banned from travelling to the US. In June, Trump signed an executive order banning nationals from 12 countries from entering the US, citing an effort to manage security threats\n\nIran, whose football team has qualified for the World Cup, is among the countries affected by the ban. The June executive order exempts athletes and coaching staff travelling for the World Cup and 2028 Olympics, though its fans could still face a ban.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the US State Department for comment.\n\nNot all travellers coming to the US next year will need a visa. Most citizens of countries under the US waiver programme can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days. That scheme covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others.\n\nAt the two most recent World Cups, in Russia and Qatar, a ticket to a game generated a fan ID that could be used like a visa to enter the host country."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd0m874g05o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"01:32:24.793+00:00","title":"Bihar: India's politicians are dishing out election freebies - but are they affordable?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India's political landscape is increasingly shaped by election-driven freebies—especially cash handouts to women—leading to significant fiscal strain.

powering election victories in India, but can its states afford them?\n\nOver the years, handouts have taken different forms in the hotly contested political landscape of the world's largest democracy. Voters have been lured with everything from television sets to  bicycles  and sometimes even gold ornaments - blurring the fine line between welfare economics and pre-poll populism.\n\nIn recent years, cash transfers, especially directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for political parties of all stripes.\n\nA sweeping victory last week in the eastern state of  Bihar  - India's poorest state - for an alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being credited in part to a 10,000 rupee ($112; £85.18) cash handout to the state's women. A record number of women turned out to vote in the election.\n\nSimilar women-oriented financial support schemes were launched by Modi's party in other states like Maharashtra ahead of polls last year. Opposition parties have also promised similar schemes in some states ahead of elections.\n\nEconomists like  Jean Drèze  have argued in favour of such giveaways. He says that while distinguishing between \"useful\" and \"wasteful\" handouts is important, it is only by extracting promises during elections that the poor in India get anything at all from their political representatives.\n\nOn the other hand, despite his party's own track record on the issue, Modi has in the past warned of the dangers of \"revdi culture\" - likening election giveaways to the frivolous distribution of sweets. India's top court had also sought to curb the distribution of such \"irrational freebies\" during elections back in 2023.\n\nWhile there is broad agreement on the need for targeted subsidies to challenge the use of handouts as electoral bait, Indian elections are increasingly dominated by unaffordable, poll-driven freebie economics that states can ill afford.\n\nAccording to research from brokerage Emkay Global, Bihar is facing considerable fiscal pressure, with the deficit or gap between what the state earns and spends at 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nDespite this, the state announced pre-election schemes amounting to 4% of GDP, more than its capital outlay - money that could have been spent in job-creating, long-term assets that would have aided the state's development.\n\nIt is just one example in a litany of states practising indiscriminate election populism, according to Emkay Global.\n\n\"Even good [fiscally prudent] states are now in the grip of freebie economics,\" the brokerage said, as a result of which the 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ceiling that has been mandated for states, to curb non-budgeted spending, is now actually the floor.\n\nSome estimates suggest that 21 of India's 29 states have  crossed  this 3% deficit target, with disproportionate costs imposed by election-driven spending being one of the reasons.\n\nThe fact that such populism is unsustainable is illustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance's Ladki Bahin (Beloved Sister) financial assistance scheme, which led to a 0.4% jump in Maharashtra state's deficit, according to Emkay Global. It forced the government to roll back some of the promises once the polls were over.\n\nIndia's central bank has also flagged the rising burden of such subsidies on state-level debt as a key emerging concern.\n\nAccording to the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) , while overall debt of Indian states declined to about 28.5% of GDP by March 2024 compared with the levels seen over the past decade, it remains well above the 20% recommended threshold, with new pressures emerging in the form of an increasing subsidy burden.\n\n\"An area of incipient stress is the sharp rise in expenditure on subsidies, driven by farm loan waivers, free/subsidised services (like electricity to agriculture and households, transport, gas cylinder) and cash transfers to farmers, youth and women,\" the RBI said in its 2024-25 report on state finances.\n\n\"States need to contain and rationalise their subsidy outgoes, so that such spending does not crowd out more productive expenditure.\"\n\nThis warning comes as the private sector continues to hold back on investment in new job-creating factories, and the government, forced to slow its own capital spending on infrastructure, turns instead to tax cuts and giveaways to spur middle-class consumption.\n\nBut with freebies seeing such success in Bihar - and more state elections looming - that warning is unlikely to be heeded.\n\n\"This [Bihar] election outcome reinforces the freebie wave that has swept states in the last two years, and with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and crucially, West Bengal going to polls next year, one can expect this race to the bottom to continue,\" Emkay Global economists Medhavi Arora and Harshal Patel said in their note.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kp6j5n68do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"21:37:17.372+00:00","title":"Off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who tried to crash plane midair will not serve prison time","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former Alaska Airlines pilot, Joseph Emerson, who attempted to shut off the engines of a passenger plane mid-flight in October 2023 while off-duty, will not serve additional prison time.

The United States and its allies do not recognize Mr. Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after last year’s election.\n\n“I’m not in love with the people running Venezuela,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nLast month, Mr. Trump called off efforts to reach a diplomatic agreement with Venezuela. Still, the president has raised the possibility for two days running that he might still talk to Mr. Maduro, though it was not clear what contact there might have been between the two governments or how serious Mr. Trump is about negotiating a deal that would avert a decision to take further military action.\n\n“We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out,” he said Sunday night as he departed from West Palm Beach, Fla. He added that Venezuela “would like to talk” but would not elaborate on what he meant.\n\n“What does it mean? You tell me, I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. When a reporter asked if he was interested in negotiations, he shrugged. “I talk to anybody,” he said. “I talk to you.”\n\nThe U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, the country’s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier, arrived in the Caribbean Sea on Sunday, expanding the U.S. military’s ability to conduct potential strikes and other attacks on Venezuelan soil. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the same day that the State Department would designate a Venezuelan group, Cartel de Los Soles, as a foreign terrorist organization and said the group is “headed by” Mr. Maduro. The designation would restrict financial transactions of the group or anyone associated with it.\n\nThe series of actions follow two meetings Mr. Trump held in the Situation Room last week, where he spoke with top military advisers to review options, including the use of Special Operations forces and direct action inside Venezuela. Shortly after a meeting on Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on social media that the mission in the Caribbean now had a name, “Southern Spear.” He described its goal in expansive terms, saying the operation “removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the arrival of the Ford and three accompanying missile-firing Navy destroyers, there are now 15,000 troops in the region, more than at any other time in decades.\n\nThe strikes by American forces on the boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific have drawn criticism from a range of experts in laws governing the use of armed forces. They say the U.S. military cannot intentionally target civilians who pose no threat of imminent violence, even if they are suspected of committing crimes.\n\nThe administration says the strikes are legal because Mr. Trump has determined that the U.S. is in an armed conflict with the drug cartels and that anyone on the boats is therefore a combatant.\n\nAt the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump suggested he was open to military strikes in Mexico, a major source of the drugs that flow into the United States.\n\n“Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? It’s OK with me,” he said. “Whatever we have to do to stop drugs.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy170jkekdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:42:33.267+00:00","title":"Ukraine to get 100 French-made Rafale F4 fighter jets in 'historic' deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine has signed a historic military agreement with France to receive up to 100 Rafale F4 fighter jets, advanced air defense systems, and French radars, with deliveries scheduled to be completed by 2035.

deal\n\nUkraine will get up to 100 of France's Rafale F4  fighter jets as well as advanced air defence systems in a major deal to boost Kyiv's ability to protect itself against deadly Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the move as \"historic\", after signing the letter of intent with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at an air base near Paris.\n\nDeliveries of the Rafale F4's are planned to be completed by 2035, while the joint production of interceptor drones is starting this year.\n\nFinancial details are yet to be worked out, but reports say France plans to attract EU financing and also access  frozen Russian assets - a controversial move that has split the 27-member bloc.\n\n\"This is a strategic agreement which will last for 10 years starting from the next year,\" Zelensky said at a joint briefing with Macron on Monday.\n\nUkraine would also get \"very strong French radars\", eight air defence systems and other advanced weaponry, he added.\n\nZelensky stressed that using such advanced systems \"means protecting someone's life... this is very important\".\n\nRussia has in recent months increased its drone and missile attacks against Ukraine, targeting energy and rail infrastructure and causing massive blackouts across the country.\n\nDozens of civilians have been killed in the strikes, in what Kyiv and its Western allies describe as war crimes. In the latest overnight Russian missile attack, three people were killed and 15 injured, in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Balakliya, local officials said.\n\nSpeaking alongside Zelensky, Macron said: \"We're planning Rafales, 100 Rafales - that's huge. That's what's needed for the regeneration of the Ukrainian military\".\n\nThe French president added that he wanted to help Ukraine prepare for whatever was coming next.\n\nThese Rafale fighter jets are seen as crucial to protecting Ukraine's skies, because the country is almost powerless in preventing long-range air strikes on its border towns and cities.\n\n\"The Russians are using 6000 glide bombs per month,\" Serhiy Kuzhan, a Ukrainian defence analyst, told the BBC. \"It would be important to have a French air to air system, with a 200km range, because Russians have their own system with a range of 230km.\"\n\nWhile this announcement between Kyiv and Paris is sizeable, Justin Bronk from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) points out: \"The difference they'll make will depend on the timeframe and the missiles that come with them\".\n\nThis is a long-term political agreement, rather than a detailed purchase order, so few are expecting this announcement to dramatically change the dynamics of Russia's grinding invasion.\n\nThe promises of Western military hardware are only as effective as the training and logistics they come with. Whether it's a German-made Leopard 2 Tank or an American F-16 fighter jet, they all require intensive training, sizable support crews and a lot of spare parts.\n\nWith the Rafales, further complexities arise around the question of who pays. It's thought France will dip into its own budget contributions for Kyiv, as well as look as joint EU borrowing mechanisms to help pay for the deal.\n\nBut what you hear privately admitted in EU's corridors of power in Brussels, is that the money is slowing running out.\n\nThe bloc has agreed to help support Ukraine's battered economy for the next two years, but there is less consensus on whether to unlock €140bn ($162bn; £123bn) of frozen Russian assets to help support Ukraine financially and militarily.\n\nThe proposals are currently illegal under international law, and some members are nervous about the prospect of having to pay Russia back when the war ends.\n\nUkraine's air force is already using France's Mirage warplanes as well  as US-made F-16s . Kyiv has also recently provisionally agreed to obtain Sweden's Gripen fighter jets.\n\nAfter France, Zelensky will travel to Spain to seek further military and other support for Ukraine.\n\nOver the weekend, he secured a gas deal with Greece.  Vital supplies of US liquefied natural gas are now expected to start flowing into Ukraine this winter  via a pipeline across the Balkans.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMoscow currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory and Russian troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line - despite reported huge combat casualties."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/politics/trump-epstein-republicans-vote.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:44:03-05:00","title":"Trump Bows to Reality in Epstein Reversal, Beating a Rare Retreat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump, who had previously denounced calls for the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files as a 'Democrat hoax' and threatened retaliation against Republicans supporting transparency, reversed course after pressure from a coalition of House Republicans and constituents.

Bows to Reality in Epstein Reversal, Beating a Rare Retreat\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T17:44:03-05:00\n\nPresident Trump denounced calls for the release of the Epstein files as a Democratic hoax. He dispatched aides to warn Republicans that backing it would be seen as a “hostile act.” He placed personal calls to those who dared to do so, and even dispatched his attorney general and F.B.I. director to meet with one in the White House Situation Room in efforts to get her to flip.\n\nIn the end, none of it worked. And on Sunday night, Mr. Trump did something he has rarely been forced to do: He caved in the face of pressure from his party and called on House Republicans to go ahead and back a bill that would order his Justice Department to release all of its investigative files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBy Monday, he was saying, “Sure,” he would sign the legislation he has spent months trying to kill.\n\nIt’s not clear that doing so would have any concrete impact; Mr. Trump could have ordered the release of the files without an act of Congress, and has not. And it remains to be seen whether his Justice Department will ultimately release the files.\n\nBut his reversal has opened the floodgates of Republican backing for the bill, which is expected to come to a vote in the House as early as Tuesday and appears likely to pass unanimously. It has also raised questions about Mr. Trump’s ability to impose his will on Republicans and the nation, suggesting a slip in his iron grip on his party amid his falling polling numbers, rising prices and rifts within his political coalition.\n\nFor the first 10 months of his presidency, Mr. Trump has steered the narrative and bullied Congress into doing whatever he wanted with almost no pushback. But as Republicans gear up for midterm elections and some begin to plot a future after Mr. Trump, the Epstein episode is a rare instance in which he has lost control.\n\nFor months, House Republicans had dreaded the prospect of a vote on releasing the Epstein files. Such a moment would leave them torn between pressure from a fervent base demanding that they support the release of the files and a vengeful president who was demanding the opposite.\n\nMr. Trump’s about-face was a bow to the inevitable that came after it had become clear that many, if not most, Republicans were planning to support the measure, wary of appearing to aid in a coverup for a sex offender.\n\n“As long as Democrats and President Trump both are calling for the release, I can’t imagine anyone not voting to release,” Representative Lance Gooden, Republican of Texas, said in a text message. “I predict 100 percent will vote to release.”\n\nEven Representative Troy Nehls, Republican of Texas, was now on board, just days after he wrote on social media that he would be a hard “no” on the release of the “Epstein hoax,” designed by Democrats to “distract us from the winning of President Trump and his administration.” He said in a text message on Monday that he would vote to release the files.\n\nMr. Trump’s turnabout came after private conversations with Republicans, who warned him that they would have to vote to release the files because of pressure from their constituents. In those conversations, according to a person briefed on them who insisted on anonymity to discuss them, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the vote was now an inevitability, and that if they needed to support it they should do so. And he listened to Republicans who told him that his opposition was making it seem like he had something to hide.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Trump did not want to lose.\n\nSo on Sunday night, the president drafted a post for Truth Social while flying aboard Air Force One from Florida to Washington, reversing course.\n\n“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files,” he wrote, “because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.”\n\nMr. Trump was forced to make the pivot because he failed to sway three Republican women who had signed onto a petition that would force a vote on the bill, which would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on Mr. Epstein within 30 days. After the petition received 218 signatures, a House majority, the rules required an eventual vote, and Speaker Mike Johnson said he would call one this week.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna, the California Democrat who is a co-sponsor of the measure, said that the vote would be an extraordinary example of a unique coalition standing up to Mr. Trump, with the backing of his MAGA base.\n\n“In 48 hours, we went from the president threatening to un-endorse Republicans and hauling them into the Situation Room to his surrendering to math,” said Mr. Khanna, who also predicted a unanimous vote.\n\nThat is in part because the measure has the backing of Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, who is often the lone dissident who breaks with his party to oppose legislation that Mr. Trump urges the conference to support. In this case, Mr. Massie is running the show: He and Mr. Khanna are co-sponsors of the Epstein transparency bill.\n\nIn his second term, Mr. Trump has tested not only norms, but also rules and laws, taking a metaphorical wrecking ball to institutions that have often bent to his will. The Epstein files have become the unusual case in which a bipartisan pair of lawmakers, with support from a tiny group of hard-right Republicans, found a way to use House rules to make it impossible for him to get his desired outcome. So on Sunday night, he changed his desired outcome.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump sounded eager to move past the episode and worried about the impact it could have on him and his party.\n\n“Let anybody look at it, but don’t talk about it too much, because honestly I don’t want to take it away from us,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, calling the Epstein files “a Democrat problem.” “The whole thing is a hoax, and I don’t want to take it away from really the greatness of what the Republican Party has accomplished over the last period of time.”\n\nAsked whether he would sign the measure, he told reporters, “Sure I would.”\n\nThat raised renewed questions about whether Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and majority leader, would bring the bill to a vote in that chamber. Mr. Thune had previously hinted that moving ahead with a vote was not a priority.\n\nBut a unanimous House vote — or even a lopsided one — in favor of releasing the files would place enormous pressure on him to allow the bill to be considered in the Senate.\n\nSenator Jacky Rosen, Democrat of Nevada, wrote to Mr. Thune last week urging him to quickly schedule a vote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/politics/comey-justice-department-misconduct.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:48:52-05:00","title":"Judge Says Justice Dept.

May Have Committed ‘Misconduct’ in Comey Case\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T12:48:52-05:00\n\nA federal magistrate judge said on Monday that Lindsey Halligan, the inexperienced prosecutor picked by President Trump to bring charges against James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, may have committed “misconduct” when she sought an indictment in the case in a way that “could compromise the grand jury process.”\n\nThe remarkable rebuke of Ms. Halligan came in a blistering 24-page ruling in which the magistrate judge, William E. Fitzpatrick, lodged broader complaints about the way that prosecutors presented the case to the grand jury and asserted that it could result in the matter being dismissed altogether.\n\nThe judge said that when Ms. Halligan appeared — by herself — in front of the grand jury, she made at least two “fundamental and highly prejudicial” misstatements of the law. He also pointed out that the grand jury materials he ordered Ms. Halligan to turn over to him for his review appeared to be incomplete and “likely do not reflect the full proceedings.”\n\n“The court is finding that the government’s actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct, are inextricably linked to the government’s grand jury presentation and deserve to be fully explored by the defense,” Judge Fitzpatrick wrote.\n\nAs part of his ruling, the judge ordered prosecutors to provide Mr. Comey’s lawyers with the grand jury materials that he has already looked at — a measure he himself described as “an extraordinary remedy.” Typically, grand jury notes are kept secret before trial, even from defendants and their lawyers.\n\nBut the disclosure was needed, Judge Fitzpatrick said, to permit Mr. Comey’s legal team to delve into the question of whether Ms. Halligan and an F.B.I. agent who testified in front of the grand jury had conducted themselves properly when they secured the indictment.\n\nThe ruling by Judge Fitzpatrick was only the most recent setback in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring charges against Mr. Comey — a decision that was initially rejected by Ms. Halligan’s predecessor as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik S. Siebert. In an extraordinary move, Mr. Trump ousted Mr. Siebert in September to make way for Ms. Halligan after he suggested there was insufficient evidence to file an indictment against Mr. Comey.\n\nJudge Fitzpatrick’s harsh words came just days after a different judge involved in the Comey case raised doubts about a separate question pertaining to Ms. Halligan: namely, whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had lawfully appointed to her post as U.S. attorney in the first place. The judge overseeing that issue said she would make a decision on the matter by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe indictment against Mr. Comey charges him with lying to and obstructing Congress during an appearance he made in September 2020 in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the hearing, he was asked questions about whether he had authorized anyone at the F.B.I. to serve as an anonymous source in newspaper articles about sensitive investigations.\n\nMs. Halligan, who had never worked on a criminal case until she was thrust into the Comey prosecution, has faced extensive scrutiny from the moment Mr. Trump installed her atop the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia against the wishes of many career prosecutors there. Her critics have pointed out that her previous experience in the law was limited to working as an insurance lawyer and serving on Mr. Trump’s defense team in the case in which he was accused of mishandling classified materials.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/world/africa/gaza-palestinians-south-africa-flights.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:56:52-05:00","title":"After Hundreds of Gazans Arrive on Mystery Flights, South Africa Asks How","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of Gazans fled the war-torn Gaza Strip via a series of flights arranged by the opaque organization Al-Majd Europe, arriving in South Africa under mysterious conditions.

said he worked for a humanitarian organization that could arrange to fly Ahmed Shehada and his family out of war-ravaged Gaza if he paid $1,600 per person to a crypto account. He demanded the money upfront.\n\nMr. Shehada thought it was a scam and declined. But after he learned of a friend who escaped Gaza through the same group, he decided to take a chance.\n\nThat decision led Mr. Shehada, 37, his wife and their two young children on a jittery 24-hour journey in two separate bus convoys, through tense Israeli checkpoints, onto a flight with an unknown destination and eventually to South Africa, a country to which he had never been.\n\n“The situation in Gaza is so dreadful, you would take such a risk,” he said.\n\nMr. Shehada, a doctor, arrived in South Africa with his family last month, among the hundreds of Palestinians who have landed there recently aboard two flights, under conditions that the South African government has deemed suspicious.\n\nThe flights were arranged by Al-Majd Europe, a group with a scant public profile that South African officials said they knew little about. South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, suggested on Monday that Israel was behind what he called “a clear agenda to cleanse the Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank” — an accusation Israel has denied.\n\n“It does seem like they were being, you know, flushed out,” said President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, adding that his government had a duty to accept Palestinians because they are “a different and special case of a people that we have supported as a country.”\n\nThe Israeli military said it received approval from a third country to send the Palestinian families there, but it did not name the country.\n\nScrutiny of the flights, and South Africa’s handling of them, comes as the country faces a high-stakes week on the international stage, hosting the first Group of 20 Summit on African soil.\n\nOfficials in South Africa, which has been among the most vocal supporters of Palestinians, have faced criticism from local activists who believe the government mishandled the arrival last week of the second plane, carrying 153 Palestinians who were forced to wait on board for at least 10 hours while their immigration status was sorted out.\n\n“The border authorities were unwilling to consider the factors that these people came from Gaza, that there’s a humanitarian crisis,” said Na’eem Jeenah, a South African activist who has assisted the Palestinians. “They were looking at it very narrowly.”\n\nMr. Shehada, who has worked for a U.N. agency since 2014, said when his flight arrived on Oct. 28, passengers were allowed to get off the plane and go through immigration just like any other international arrival.\n\nHe said he and his family were displaced 12 times during the war. He contacted Al-Majd in March after a colleague sent him a link to the website over WhatsApp. He filled out a form there, and in April someone from the organization called him.\n\nWhen he decided to leave months later, Mr. Shehada, said he paid $6,400 andgot a call shortly before midnight on Oct. 26. The family needed to get to Khan Younis to leave in four hours, an Al-Majd representative told him.\n\nThere, they boarded a bus and were told to close the blinds and refrain from using their phones before entering Rafah, he said. Al-Majd instructed them to tell anyone who asked what they were doing, that they were part of the French Embassy evacuation.\n\n“ We said to ourselves, ‘What if they have no connection with the Israeli army and we go into Rafah and they start shooting at the buses?’” Mr. Shehada said.\n\nThey made it to the Kerem Shalom border post, where Israeli troops told them to leave all their belongings behind. They walked through several security checks and onto new buses that took them to Ramon Airport in southern Israel to board a charter flight, he said. They were not told until mid-flight that they were going to Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nFrom there, they flew to South Africa, he said, where he received his last message from Al-Majd, telling him of a guesthouse booked for his family — but  for only a week, though the group had promised a month.\n\nA message on Al-Majd’s website on Monday said it was operating as normal and continuing to provide services, and warned of online scams using the organization’s name.

Lowell, represents the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and a federal reserve governor, Lisa Cook. His attack on Mr. Pulte came in separate documents related to each case.\n\nIn one, a motion to dismiss a criminal case against Ms. James, Mr. Lowell characterized Mr. Pulte’s aggressive championing of the prosecution as so improper that it amounted to “outrageous government conduct” and a violation of Ms. James’s Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nMr. Lowell also sent a letter to the Justice Department, which is investigating Ms. Cook after Mr. Pulte sent two criminal referrals about her mortgage paperwork. In the letter, he said that Mr. Pulte had coordinated with the White House to smear the president’s enemies.\n\nIn tandem, the documents amounted to a frontal attack on Mr. Pulte, highlighting his role at the helm of the once-obscure Federal Housing Finance Agency and the way he has used his access to housing paperwork to cast aspersions on White House targets.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. The Justice Department, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Mr. Pulte did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Lowell also disclosed information that may weaken the Justice Department’s case against Ms. James. She was indicted in Virginia on accusations of bank fraud related to her classification of a residence in that state as a second home. The case rests in part whether Ms. James misrepresented her plans to occupy the home, but an official within Mr. Pulte’s agency suggested that there was not clear and convincing evidence of occupancy fraud, according to a chat excerpt included in the filing.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Pulte has accused Ms. Cook of improperly classifying several homes as primary residences. In his letter, Mr. Lowell addressed the specifics of the allegations for the first time.\n\nMr. Pulte has become a trusted ally of Mr. Trump in part by attacking his adversaries, including Ms. Cook, whom Mr. Trump has sought to fire to gain greater sway over the Federal Reserve. Mr. Pulte also has pursued Ms. James; Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California; and Representative Eric Swalwell, also a Democrat from California. He accused all of mortgage fraud.\n\nMr. Pulte has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats for sidestepping the usual process of allowing the agency’s inspector general to investigate such claims of fraud, instead taking it upon himself to make criminal referrals to federal prosecutors.\n\nThe agency’s acting inspector general, John Allen, had been looking into aspects of the referrals made by Mr. Pulte when he was removed from his post a little over a week ago, a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak about it said. Mr. Allen returned to his prior job as chief counsel for the agency’s inspector general.\n\nOn Monday, a group of Democratic senators led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog with investigative powers that is not answerable to the Trump administration, to investigate Mr. Pulte’s work at the housing agency.\n\nMr. Pulte has said he relied on tips and public information before making his referrals and publicizing some on his X social media account, which has about 3 million followers.\n\nThe case against Ms. James is the first that Mr. Pulte has pushed to result in an indictment, and Mr. Lowell is attempting to dismiss it on several grounds. The outrageous government conduct argument was unusual. Such motions typically come in cases in which a defendant is likely to say that he was entrapped by the government into committing a crime.\n\nRarely used defense motions have become more common as federal judges have become more distrustful of the Justice Department under Mr. Trump.\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Pulte’s other accusations will result in indictments or survive scrutiny from judges. Generally, housing and legal experts have said, paperwork errors and household moves can make such cases difficult to pursue.\n\nIn the letter related to Ms. Cook’s homes, Mr. Lowell noted that recent reporting has indicated that Trump administration officials — including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy — have also identified multiple properties as principal residences in mortgage filings.\n\n“Director Pulte has ignored many of those allegations,” Mr. Lowell wrote, adding that those that he had failed to refer “share a commonality — they involve Trump-aligned Republicans.”\n\nIn August, Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Pulte’s allegations and announced he was firing Ms. Cook.\n\nShe has notched legal victories since, with the Supreme Court siding with lower courts in allowing her to stay on as a governor as her case is litigated. The justices will hear arguments on the case on Jan. 21.\n\nMs. Cook’s lawyers have previously been focused on keeping her in her job. But their letter on Monday responded directly to Mr. Pulte’s suggestion that Ms. Cook might have committed crimes by stating in paperwork over the years that she held primary residences in Michigan, Georgia and Massachusetts.\n\nMs. Cook is being investigated in Michigan and Georgia, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a continuing investigation.\n\nMr. Lowell’s response was systematic. He wrote that she had properly classified two of the three homes, those in Michigan and Massachusetts, as primary residences while living in those states.\n\nHe implied that Ms. Cook had improperly written in a mortgage application that a Georgia apartment would also be a primary residence. But he said that Ms. Cook had also informed the lender that she would be using the condo as a vacation home. The conflicting rationales make it difficult to argue that she was attempting to fool the lender, he wrote.\n\nMr. Trump’s attempt to oust Ms. Cook from the Fed marks the most aggressive effort yet to put pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates. He has called for lower borrowing costs, which he believes are crucial to unleashing an economic boom.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump targeted Ms. Cook, she quickly retained Mr. Lowell, who has made a practice of representing the White House’s enemies. Along with Ms. Cook and Ms. James, he has also been retained by John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Mr. Trump who was recently indicted by the Justice Department; Susan Monarez, the fired director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and several others.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/etel-haxhiaj-ice-immigration-election-massachusetts.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:14-05:00","title":"A Councilwoman Intervened During an ICE Arrest.

A cold wind tugged at the sign in her hands, threatening to blow it away.\n\nMs. Haxhiaj, 45, was a two-term city councilwoman in the city.

And she was facing a worrisome reality: Her actions in May could cost her the election, even in this diverse, immigrant-friendly, majority-Democratic city.\n\nThe controversy had brought new campaign donations and support.

After a major incident in September 2025 when 20 Russian drones flew into Poland, sparking widespread concern, there is growing pressure within NATO and the EU to develop a comprehensive response. The system would use a combination of radars, sensors, jamming, and interceptors to detect and neutralize drones, with a target of full operational capability by 2027. Experts debate its realism, citing high costs, vast geographical scale, and the rapid technological evolution of drones, which leads to a constant arms race. While the drone wall is seen as necessary for countries near Russia’s border, such as Poland and the Baltics, critics argue it is not a foolproof solution. A more strategic alternative — targeting the drone launch bases — is suggested to deter attacks, but such actions would be extremely escalatory. Ultimately, the article underscores a complex strategic dilemma: balancing defensive resilience against the reality of evolving, asymmetric warfare in the hybrid conflict environment between Russia and Western Europe.","keyTakeAways":["The concept of a 'drone wall' refers to a coordinated, multi-layered defense system across Europe designed to detect, track, and neutralize incoming drones from

plan to build a 'drone wall' against Russia?\n\nFirst comes the warning, that disembodied voice over the tannoy: \"Your attention please. Air siren in the city. Please move to the shelter on the minus second floor.\" Then comes the mosquito-like whine of the incoming Russian drones, massing in their hundreds just above the clouds.\n\nIt's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens.\n\nThis is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine.\n\nThese are attack drones that explode on impact.\n\nDrones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield.\n\nAcross western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of \"hybrid warfare\" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine.\n\nRecent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries.\n\nNow, there is talk that a \"drone wall\" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic?\n\nOn 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports.\n\nNato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions.\n\nThis was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began.\n\nWhich is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing.\n\n\"This momentum is really driven by these recent incursions,\" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank.\n\nDrones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space.\n\nOn the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices.\n\nBut these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall.\n\nPreviously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September.\n\nSo, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond?\n\nAfter all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: \"[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money.\"\n\nUkraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians.\n\nThen there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nBut there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war.\n\nThat is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared.\n\nSometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports, including one in Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania.\n\nUnlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these \"civilian drones\" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships.\n\nSuspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility.\n\nBelgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions).\n\nThere is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base?\n\nThe UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones.\n\nStill, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants.\n\nThe plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia.\n\nThe wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea.\n\nIt's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027.\n\nNot surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia.\n\nKatja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue.\n\nBut she adds:  \"This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders.\"\n\nNonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic.\n\nRobert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some \"sort of impervious wall\", is, in his words, out of the question.\n\nYet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try.\n\n\"For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,\" he says.\n\n\"The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable\", agrees Ms Bego.\n\n\"It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them.\"\n\nFabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones.\n\n\"You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets.\n\n\"You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill.\"\n\nHard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders.\n\nAs for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters.\n\n\"You can have lasers which could be useful as well,\" he adds, \"but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be.\"\n\nAndré Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once.\n\nAs tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called \"hybrid\" or \"grey zone\" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them.\n\nThese include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables.\n\nAnd yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority.\n\nThe first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised.\n\nMeanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge.\n\nMr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. \"You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres.\n\n\"And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap.\"\n\nThe question of finance is a complex one. \"It is a really difficult defence question,\" says Mr Tollast. \"Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well.\n\n\"So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people.\"\n\nIt will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets.\n\nInitially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it.\n\n\"Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion...\n\n\"The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets\".\n\nAs for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, \"they can definitely achieve more protection by then\".\n\nWhile all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them.\n\nThis all makes it something of a new arms race.\n\n\"The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,\" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology.\n\n\"It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust.\n\n\"The aggressor\", he concludes, \"will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through\".\n\nSo are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow.\n\n\"It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,\" argues Ms Bego.\n\n\"And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this.\"\n\nBut any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory.\n\nEver since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war.\n\nBuilding a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another.\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images, Sketchfab\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Security Council Adopts U.S. Peace Plan for Gaza\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T17:35:53-05:00\n\nThe United Nations Security Council on Monday approved President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, a breakthrough that provides a legal U.N. mandate for the administration’s vision of how to move past the cease-fire and rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip after two years of war.\n\nThe Council’s vote was also a major diplomatic victory for the Trump administration. For the past two years, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas has raged, the United States had been isolated at the United Nations over its staunch support for Israel.\n\nThe U.S. resolution calls for an International Stabilization Force to enter, demilitarize and govern Gaza. The proposal, which has attached Mr. Trump’s 20 point cease-fire plan, also envisions a “Board of Peace” to oversee the peace plan, though it does not clarify the composition of the board.\n\nThe resolution passed with 13 votes in favor and zero vetoes. Russia and China, either of which could have vetoed the resolution, abstained, apparently swayed by the support for it from a number of Arab and Muslim nations.\n\nMike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who addressed the Council before the vote, called Gaza “hell on earth” and held up a copy of the resolution, describing it as “a lifeline.” After the vote, Mr. Waltz thanked the Council for “joining us in charting a new course for Israelis, Palestinians and all the people in the region alike.”\n\nSecurity Council resolutions are considered legally binding international law, and although the Council does not have a mechanism for enforcing such resolutions, it can take measures to punish violators with penalties such as sanctions.\n\n“It’s a win-win,” said Richard Gowan, the U.N. director of the International Crisis Group, a conflict-preventing organization. “It’s a diplomatic victory for Trump but also a recognition that the U.N. matters.”\n\nStill, the path forward is still plagued by many uncertainties, with Israeli strikes continuing in Gaza and outbreaks of violence erupting in the West Bank. Among the next steps would be naming members of the Board of Peace, the body in charge of overseeing the transition in Gaza, and clarify under whose authority the stabilization forces would operate.\n\nThe resolution says that if the Palestinian Authority, which partly governs the West Bank, undergoes reforms and the redevelopment of the shattered Gaza Strip advances, the conditions “may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”\n\nThat language drew objections from Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying on Sunday that “our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed.”\n\nThe resolution went through multiple revisions in negotiations last week and faced significant pushback from many Council members, including Europeans, who demanded more clarity on Palestinian statehood and the Board of Peace.\n\nAt one point late last week, objections by China and Russia, which typically coordinate their positions around resolutions by the United States, threatened to derail the U.S. resolution altogether. Russia drafted its own 10-point counterresolution on Gaza, which called outright for Palestinian statehood and said the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza should be joined as a state under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe United States made minimal compromises on the resolution and instead rallied the support of Arab countries — Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — as well as Indonesia, Turkey and Pakistan, which is a member of the Council, to pressure Russia and China not to be seen as obstacles to a breakthrough in Gaza. Diplomats said that Mr. Waltz, had warned the countries during negotiations that if the resolution failed, the cease-fire in Gaza would collapse.\n\nThe stakes were high for all the major actors. Palestinians want the suffering and the war to end. Israelis want Hamas disarmed. And the United States hoped to be the major player bringing peace to the region.\n\nMike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, told NBC News in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he believed “we are on the brink of a historic realignment in the Middle East.” Now, Washington’s plan for the Gaza cease-fire, reconstruction and stabilization has the weight of the Security Council behind it.\n\nThe Trump administration sought the mandate of the United Nations because countries tapped to contribute troops to the stabilization forces in Gaza — Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates — said they needed Security Council authorization so that their troops would not be viewed by their own populations as occupiers in Gaza.\n\nThe resolution also allows the World Bank, a U.N. entity, to allocate financial resources for the reconstruction of Gaza and calls for the establishment of a dedicated trust fund for this purpose.\n\nThe resolution authorizes the Board of Peace to oversee Gaza at least until the end of 2027 and says that the enclave would be managed day-to-day by a “technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip.”\n\nThe International Stabilization Force would be responsible for destroying military infrastructure in Gaza and decommissioning militant groups’ weaponry.\n\nIt would coordinate with Egypt and Israel to train and support Palestinian police personnel, protect civilians, work to secure humanitarian corridors and secure border areas.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/business/fed-bowman-bank-oversight.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:26:37-05:00","title":"Wall Street’s Top Cop Ushers In Lighter-Touch Oversight of Banks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve, under the leadership of Vice Chair Michelle W.

The way the central bank had long monitored and addressed risks across the financial system was in for a drastic overhaul.\n\nThe memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times, contained a list of directives for Fed examiners and supervisory staff across the country that significantly curtailed how closely they scrutinized lenders. It followed a host of changes made by Michelle W. Bowman, a Fed governor, who since becoming vice chair for supervision at the start of the summer had been providing regulatory relief to banks. One day after the memo was sent, Ms. Bowman announced a 30 percent cut in staff across her division in Washington.\n\nCurrent and former policymakers and legal experts were already worried that those changes would encourage exactly the kind of risk-taking that could sow the seeds for the next crisis. But the sweeping nature of the plans outlined in the memo is likely to further fan fears that supervisors will be less equipped to spot such a crisis in advance, risking deeper damage to the economy.\n\n“As a guiding principle, staff should not assume that our current or past operating practices should continue going forward,” the memo said. Staff “should take note of the significant shift in direction and implement the changes necessary to align our supervisory work and messaging with this new approach.”\n\nThe memo was sent by Mary Aiken, acting director of the Fed’s division of supervision and regulation, and Julie Williams, acting deputy director, who stepped into those roles recently after the departure of several Fed veterans. But it was clear they were acting on orders from above.\n\nMs. Bowman, who was appointed to the role by President Trump, has long argued that banks across the country face far too much red-tape and should be allowed to operate which much lighter-touch oversight — views that align with other Trump-appointed financial regulators, the administration and industry lobbyists. In her first speech as vice chair in June, Ms. Bowman said the “task of policymakers and regulators is not to eliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and effectively managed.”\n\nWith these changes, Ms. Bowman says she is trying to make the Fed more efficient and effective in safeguarding the financial system — something the Fed struggled with as recently as 2023. Back then, the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank rattled regional lenders across the country and led to a string of bank closures.\n\n“There is no sign that a financial crisis is imminent, but these changes in the aggregate might set the stage for another one,” said Kathryn Judge, a financial regulation expert at Columbia Law School.\n\nThe three-page memo was expansive in its reach.\n\nNo longer would examiners and supervisory staff focus on anything other than a “material financial risk” to a lender’s “safety and soundness” or the financial system. They should not become “distracted” from that priority by “devoting excessive attention to processes, procedures and documentation” of activities that did not reach that threshold. Nor should they devote as many resources to “smaller, less complex and less systemic organizations.”\n\nIn a shift from the past, examiners were given stricter rules about issuing warnings known as “matters requiring attention” or “matters requiring immediate attention,” which have helped to flag risks across the financial system. The memo made clear that the standard for those warnings was changing, and it ordered reserve banks to only independently verify whether an issue was resolved if the company’s internal audit was deemed insufficient.\n\nExaminers should also ensure that warnings were not written in “vague or overbroad language.”\n\nThe memo also outlined changes that sought to limit the oversight power of two groups created by the Fed’s board after the 2008 financial crisis. Those programs — the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee and the Large and Foreign Banking Organization — have aimed to assess risks across the biggest institutions to allow for more comprehensive coverage. But now, those group were directed to avoid conducting such assessments, known as a “horizontal reviews,” unless authorized by the Fed’s deputy director of supervision.\n\nA shift in tack is not unusual when a new vice chair for supervision takes over. Changeovers for that position, which was created after the financial crisis, tend to track election cycles more closely than any other role at the politically independent Fed.\n\nMs. Bowman’s predecessor, Michael S. Barr, a Biden administration appointee who pushed for stringent bank regulations, announced his departure in January to avoid a legal fight with Mr. Trump. Randal K. Quarles, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, resigned at the end of the first year of the Biden administration, having loosened the regulatory reins on Wall Street.\n\nIn addition to setting policy, the Fed’s division in Washington oversees the reserve banks, which carry out the board’s orders and interact with lenders.\n\nUnder Ms. Bowman’s leadership, the Fed has already announced a number of regulatory changes. These include loosening a rule dictating how much easy-to-access money lenders need to set aside against their leverage and making annual tests gauging banks’ ability to withstand shocks less onerous. Both were approved by a majority of the seven-person board of governors, including the Fed’s chair, Jerome H. Powell.\n\nMs. Bowman has spearheaded those efforts amid a raft of departures from the top ranks of her division, which she wants to shrink from around 500 employees to roughly 350 by the end of next year.\n\n“This is dismantling supervision and regulation in a much more public way than we’ve seen in the past,” said Ellen Meade, who served as a senior adviser at the Fed until 2021. “Cutting bodies at some point can result in cutting functions and competency.”\n\nThe Fed is not the only financial regulator undergoing upheaval to align with the Trump administration’s vision. The president wants more sway over how the central bank and other independent institutions, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, oversee Wall Street. In January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing more authority over rule changes.\n\nAnother regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which oversees lenders that are not banks, including payday lenders and debt collectors, has already been gutted. Non-bank companies are especially prevalent in the mortgage market, where they originate more than half of all new loans.\n\nAfter becoming acting director in February, Russell T. Vought, the director of the White House budget office, immediately ordered C.F.P.B. employees to halt their work.\n\nBefore Mr. Vought arrived, the bureau’s supervision department was its largest division, with nearly 500 analysts and examiners. The group scrutinized financial companies’ handling of products like checking accounts, car loans, mortgages and credit cards, and exposed improper fees, charges for services never provided, errant auto repossessions and wrongful foreclosures. The agency forced banks and other lenders to return nearly $20 billion to customers.\n\nMr. Vought stopped all exams. He also ordered all outstanding regulatory issues to be resolved by the end of the year. The bureau’s examiners have been instructed to accept financial companies’ claims and close issues without further verification, according to two employees involved in the work.\n\nMr. Vought wants to close the agency, which cannot be done without congressional approval. The agency recently told a federal court that it would run out of operating cash early next year.\n\nThe F.D.I.C. and the O.C.C. are scaling back their examination processes and have cut their supervisory teams through buyouts and attrition. The agencies are gathering public comments on a proposal to stop flagging potential problems that do not pose the threat of “material harm” to an institution.\n\nBecause the biggest banks handle trillions of dollars, even issues affecting large numbers of customers or big markets might not rise to that level. After a sham accounts scandal came to light at Wells Fargo, the O.C.C. acknowledged that its examiners had overlooked years of warning signs.\n\nThe Fed and the F.D.I.C. declined to comment. The C.F.P.B. did not respond to a request for comment. An O.C.C. spokesman said the agency’s proposed changes would reinforce a “risk-based” approach to supervision.\n\nDaniel K. Tarullo, a former Fed governor, said that bank supervision could be made more efficient, but that he was apprehensive about the recent changes.\n\n“The whole point of supervision is to fill in the many blanks that are left by quantitative metrics,” he said. “If your regulations on capital are less restrictive, then you should be more focused on making sure that any shift in bank activities is not creating problems.”\n\nPeggy L. Twohig, who led the consumer bureau’s supervision department until 2021, added that supervision is effective because examiners can flag risks to financial institutions confidentially, allowing lenders to address problems before they get too big. “People don’t know what problems were stopped before they had a chance to hurt them,” she said.\n\nAnother former regulator worried about the rules being applied unevenly, leading to inconsistent standards for a healthy bank. Fewer supervisors could mean less capacity to track risks that may appear small but could become more significant.\n\n“When you create blind spots like this, you limit what your range of visibility is,” said Peter Conti-Brown, an expert on Fed governance at the University of Pennsylvania. “Why does the drunk look for his keys under the light post? Because that’s where the light is. But we want to be able to find our keys where they are.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/politics/trump-epstein-files-congress.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:48:49-05:00","title":"Trump Has the Power to Release the Epstein Files, With or Without Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has reversed his opposition to a congressional bill that would require the Justice Department to release more materials from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, signaling support for the legislation if it reaches his desk.

Why doesn’t he immediately order Attorney General Pam Bondi to make the documents public?\n\nThe fact is that if Mr. Trump chooses to, he can indeed order more files released — with or without legislation — much as he did in other cases of intense public interest, including the killings of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President John F. Kennedy.\n\nDemocrats have accused the president of trying to cover up embarrassing material by hiding files related to Mr. Epstein, his former friend who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking minors.\n\nBut the White House contends that it has already made public tens of thousands of pages of documents tied to the Epstein investigation and that nothing will satisfy Mr. Trump’s critics.\n\nIn February, Ms. Bondi released a few hundred pages of documents in the Epstein case, including an evidence list, flight logs, a contact book and a heavily redacted masseuse list.\n\nIn September, House Republicans released more than 30,000 pages of documents provided to them by the Trump administration in response to a subpoena; and then another 20,000 last week from the Epstein estate.\n\n“We’ve already given 50,000 pages,” Mr. Trump complained on Monday, adding, “No matter what we give, it’s never enough.”\n\nBut a federal judge has said there are more than 100,000 pages of files and materials related to the Justice Department’s investigation into Mr. Epstein, and the Justice Department has confirmed that it possesses more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence, including files that must be withheld.\n\nOn Monday, a White House official said the administration was releasing documents in conjunction with the House Oversight Committee’s continuing investigation.\n\nFor years, the allegations of sexual abuse against Mr. Epstein — and his close connections to the rich and powerful — have fueled a desire for the release of more documents about his case to expose any other potential abusers.\n\nBut Trump officials, including Ms. Bondi, repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered what they would make public, angering the president’s supporters.\n\nWhen Ms. Bondi released binders full of documents titled “The Epstein Files, Phase 1” just a month into Mr. Trump’s new term, they were widely panned as a disappointment.\n\nAnd there was never a “Phase 2.”\n\nInstead, the Justice Department released an unsigned memo in July informing Mr. Trump’s base that its review of the files “revealed no incriminating ‘client list.’”\n\n“There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” the memo stated. “We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n\nBy this time, Ms. Bondi had already informed Mr. Trump that his name appeared in the files.\n\nThen Congress became involved.\n\nUsing a maneuver known as a discharge petition, Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, have been able to circumvent Republican House leadership.\n\nTheir legislation calls on the Justice Department to make public certain records related to the investigations into Mr. Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring to sexually traffic minors.\n\nSpecifically, the Justice Department must publicly disclose “all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials,” including “records relating to Epstein’s detention and death; flight logs of aircraft owned or used by Epstein; individuals named in connection with Epstein’s criminal activities, civil settlements, or immunity or plea agreements; immunity deals, sealed settlements, or plea bargains of Epstein or his associates; entities with ties to Epstein’s trafficking or financial networks; and internal Justice Department communications concerning decisions to investigate or charge Epstein or his associates.”\n\nThe legislation also calls for the Justice Department, within 15 days of turning over the documents, to provide Congress with a list of all categories of records released and withheld, all redactions made and their legal basis, and “all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials.”\n\nThe legislation contains a list of exceptions that are very similar to the reasons Ms. Bondi initially cited in her decision to withhold many of the documents.\n\nIn withholding the files, the Justice Department said many contained images of victims, downloaded videos of illegal child sex abuse or materials that had been ordered sealed by a court. The seal served to protect victims but also to ensure the case did “not expose any additional third parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n\nIn the legislation, the Trump administration may withhold records that are classified, identify victims or include images of child sexual abuse, or that would jeopardize an active federal investigation. The Justice Department “may not withhold or redact records on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity,” it adds.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump demanded that the Justice Department investigate a list of powerful men mentioned in some of the emails turned over by the Epstein estate — singling out only Democrats. Ms. Bondi said she had started the investigation.\n\nAfter the president’s order to open an investigation into Mr. Epstein’s Democratic associates, it was unclear on Monday whether the administration intended to argue that the new investigation permitted it to deny requests for documents from previous Epstein investigations.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/climate/epa-curbs-protections-for-wetlands.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"14:21:56-05:00","title":"E.P.A.

Rule Would Drastically Curb Protections for Wetlands\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T14:21:56-05:00\n\nThe Trump administration proposed on Monday to significantly limit the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to limit pollution in wetlands, rivers and other bodies of water across the country.\n\nThe proposed rule could strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, potentially threatening sources of clean drinking water for millions of Americans. It was a victory for a range of business interests that have lobbied to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, including farmers, home builders, real estate developers, oil drillers and petrochemical manufacturers.\n\n“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, other landowners and governments,” said Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, during an event at the agency’s headquarters in Washington featuring Republican members of Congress and industry executives.\n\nUnder the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals must obtain a permit from the E.P.A. before releasing pollutants into the nation’s waterways. They must receive a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before discharging any dredged or fill material, such as sand, silt or construction debris.\n\nA 2023 Supreme Court decision had set the stage for the E.P.A.’s action by curtailing the agency’s power to police millions of acres of wetlands. In the majority opinion in Sackett v. E.P.A., Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Clean Water Act allowed the agency to regulate only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a “relatively permanent” body of water.\n\nBut Justice Alito did not explicitly define a “relatively permanent” body of water. Now, the Trump administration is describing it as a body of water that flows either year-round or during the “wet season.”\n\nThe new definition would exclude wetlands that abut or touch many intermittent streams, which do not flow during dry periods. It also could exclude ephemeral streams, which sit dry for much of the year and fill up only after rainfall or snowmelt.\n\nThese changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.\n\n“The administration is preparing to rip away protections from the vast majority of wetlands in the United States, which are the waters that protect our communities from floods, help filter drinking water and provide habitat for millions of birds and fish,” said Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president for nature at N.R.D.C.\n\nEphemeral streams can be small, but a recent study found that they provided about 55 percent of the water flowing through most river systems used in drinking water supplies.\n\n“This rule will mean more unsafe drinking water and more expensive water treatment costs for taxpayers,” said Jim Murphy, senior director of legal advocacy at the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders, an industry trade group, praised the Trump administration’s proposal, saying it would slash costs for builders and developers, potentially lowering the price of new homes. “This is a significant step toward reducing regulatory red tape, cutting permitting costs and lowering the cost of doing business in communities across the country — all while continuing to protect our nation’s vital waterways,” Buddy Hughes, chairman of the association, said in a statement.\n\nRepresentative Bruce Westerman, Republican of Arkansas and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, said the proposal would help fix a “broken” permitting process in the United States. “We’re losing our ability to build things here in America,” he said at the E.P.A. event.\n\nEver since Congress passed the Clean Water Act to protect all “waters of the United States,” policymakers in Washington have been squabbling over how, exactly, to define those bodies of water.\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration widened the law’s scope to cover smaller streams and headwaters. Several Republican-led states challenged the rule in court as an example of regulatory overreach, leading a federal judge to pause its implementation.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, the E.P.A. repealed the Obama-era rule and issued a weaker version. Then in 2023 the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. E.P.A., dealing a setback to the Biden administration’s efforts to again strengthen the regulation.\n\nThe Sackett case concerned an Idaho couple, Michael and Chantell Sackett, who sought to build a house on what an appeals court called “a soggy residential lot” near a lake. The E.P.A. determined that there were wetlands on the property, and it ordered the couple to stop construction or risk paying fines of more than $40,000 per day.\n\nThe Sacketts, represented by the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, sued.

too.\n\nEvery year, I tell myself I’m going to keep Thanksgiving simple, and every year, I fail. Not in the frantic way, but in that way where “simple” quickly turns into “well, maybe just one more dish.”\n\nSo I’ve stopped fighting it. The cooking part is the best part. (I mean, I love my family, but I see them all the time.) It’s the one day that still feels deeply analog — everyone crowded in the kitchen, things bubbling, the air heavy with butter, thyme and my husband Keith’s ’90s-filled playlist. And as a food writer and recipe creator, cooking is what I do for a living — and how I find calm, even when I’m doing it for a crowd.\n\nThis year’s menu channels that desire for abundance. It’s in every way more — fresher, more colorful and full of texture, a table that enlivens rather than lulls — but it’s also manageable, whether you make one dish or all of them.\n\nThis isn’t a reinvention of Thanksgiving, but it is a reminder that the meal doesn’t have to feel like a rerun. The dishes are familiar, but they’ve been lightened, brightened, given a pulse. The turkey gets a sweet-tart pomegranate glaze that looks like lacquered mahogany. The mashed potatoes are tinted gold with turmeric and sharp Cheddar. Even the cranberry sauce, normally an afterthought, is finished with a drizzle of tahini that, you have to trust me, will make it the dish everyone’s talking about. It’s a mix of dishes that look good, taste even better and make the whole day feel like something worth celebrating rather than something to get through.\n\nThis year, I’ll be hosting in my new home, which adds a layer of stress, but mostly excitement. Keith is in charge of the table, flowers and most important, keeping me calm. My mother will be my right-hand in the kitchen. My in-laws will bring the wine and some boisterous New Jersey energy. If the turkey takes longer than expected, who cares! If the whipped cream’s too stiff, no one will notice. All the small things, they’re forgettable. There’s something bigger around this table that we’re here for, and that part is hard to mess up.\n\nWhipped together, feta and yogurt turn impossibly light and pale green, before being finished with olive oil, pistachios and Aleppo chile, the perfect way to welcome guests.\n\nA glaze of reduced pomegranate juice, soy sauce, honey, herbs and garlic gives this bird its shine, and the browned-butter gravy, full of shallots and black pepper, can easily be made ahead.\n\nAt least one orange side is essential at Thanksgiving. Here, squash wedges are simply roasted, then layered over citrusy yogurt and finished with a chile crisp that hits sweet, salty and spicy all at once.\n\nThese mashed potatoes glow. Turmeric gives them their golden hue. Cheddar adds sharpness, and buttermilk keeps them bright and light.\n\nEqual parts vegetable and gratin, this dish of charred sprouts, lemony cream and a golden breadcrumb crust just feels right.\n\nWe’re swapping the stuffing out for rice, a Thanksgiving staple for my family (and maybe yours, too?). Long-grain rice is gently steamed with fresh chiles, ginger, garlic, shallots and coconut milk. It’s camouflaged with crispy kale chips and cilantro for a big green finish.\n\nJammy, garnet-red and scented with cardamom, this version relies on tahini to soften the tartness and beckon you back for another spoonful.\n\nA cake this good makes a strong argument for its presence next to the pies. Deeply spiced but not heavy, olive-oil rich but fluffy, and finished with salted maple cream that you can dollop into your post-dinner coffee, too.\n\nEven though I’ve hosted countless times, I know there will be stressful moments, but the entire holiday doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Give yourself time (and maybe dabble in some meditation). If you don’t have four days (totally understandable), watch our video on how to do it all in two.\n\nYou’re in the honeymoon phase: hopeful, organized, slightly naïve. Go to the store while the markets are still calm (mornings!), grab the prettiest herbs you can find and clear your fridge.\n\nShop for all ingredients; organize produce, herbs and pantry staples.\n\nIf your turkey is frozen, begin thawing in the refrigerator.\n\nWash and prep kale and herbs; wrap in damp towels and refrigerate.\n\nIf you haven’t delegated wine and cocktail duty (you should), place a wine order or pick some up today.\n\nYou’re not doing much cooking yet. Relish it. This is a good night for takeout, going to dinner or seeing a movie.\n\nMake the green feta dip (keeps perfectly for three days).\n\nMake the chile crisp (without citrus zest) for the roasted squash.\n\nThis is when things start to smell good while the kitchen gets slowly demolished.\n\nMake the honeyed cranberries (leaving the tahini off until just before serving).\n\nBake the olive oil pumpkin cake. Cool it completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic and store it at room temperature. (You’ll make the salted whipped cream on Thanksgiving Day.)\n\nThis is a highly productive day, but if you pace yourself, it’s also highly satisfying. You’ll wake up to a fridge full of promise and go to bed feeling like someone who has their life together.\n\nMake the kale chips for the coconut pilaf and store in an airtight container.\n\nCook the brussels sprouts with the leeks and cream, then transfer to a baking dish, scatter the breadcrumb topping over (don’t bake yet), and refrigerate.\n\nPrep the vegetables for crudité (wash, cut, and chill).\n\nSet the table and organize linens, servingware and florals.\n\nMake the brown butter gravy for the turkey. Cover and refrigerate.\n\n7 a.m.: Have a proper breakfast, that second cup of coffee or tea, and get the playlist going.\n\n8 a.m.: Make the mashed potatoes (without the chives). Keep covered in the pot to rewarm later over very low heat.\n\n9 a.m.: Cook the coconut pilaf. Keep covered in the pot to rewarm later over very low heat.\n\n10 a.m.: Take the turkey out of the fridge to come to room temperature. Drizzle tahini over the cooled cranberries, make the citrus yogurt for the squash and add the citrus zest to the chile crisp. Whip the salted maple cream in a stand mixer or by hand. Cover and chill until you are ready to top the cake.\n\n10:30 to 11 a.m.: Heat the oven for the turkey. Tidy the kitchen and reset your work space. Double-check platters, serving utensils and hot pads.\n\n11 a.m.: Put the turkey in the oven, and start roasting and glazing. Taste the green feta dip and adjust with a little lemon if needed, then set out for snacking, along with the crudité. Take five minutes to sit down before guests arrive.\n\n12:30 to 12:55 p.m. The turkey should be done around now. Use tongs to tilt it slightly over the pan to let any juices run off before transferring to a cutting board and letting it rest (uncovered) for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\nRewarm the mashed potatoes and brown butter gravy on the stovetop over very low heat, stirring occasionally. Rewarm the coconut pilaf (covered) over very low heat.\n\n12:55 p.m. Transfer the brussels sprouts to the oven and bake until bubbling and golden. Spoon the citrus yogurt on a platter, layer the squash on top and finish with the chile crisp. Reheat the roasted squash in the oven for about 10 minutes or until warmed through.\n\n1:05 to 1:30 p.m.: Transfer the coconut pilaf to a serving dish, and scatter the kale chips and cilantro over. Transfer the warmed mashed potatoes to a serving dish and top with more butter, pepper and the chives.\n\n1:30 p.m.: Top off drinks, call everyone to the table and eat.\n\nWhenever: Top the pumpkin cake with the whipped cream, and finish with maple drizzle and flaky salt.

hopes Britain’s restrictive new policy on asylum seekers will give him a grip on a feverish immigration debate that is threatening his government. But the harsh new rules are already eliciting charges of “performative cruelty,” not least from lawmakers in his own Labour Party.\n\nThat is only the beginning of the challenges that will confront Mr. Starmer. He is pitching a policy that will deny refugees the ability to settle permanently in Britain until they have been in the country for 20 years — up from the current five years — and subject them to regular reviews, after which they can be forced to return to their home countries if those counties are once again deemed safe.\n\nBritain is emulating Denmark, which has set out to make the lives of refugees as uncomfortable as possible to deter others from following them. Immigration experts have labeled this approach, parts of which have been tried by other Scandinavian countries, “negative nation branding.”\n\nWhether going negative, however, will cause the number of arrivals to Britain to fall as it did in Denmark is an open question. Moreover, experts say, the policy could have a corrosive long-term effect on legal immigrants, who often feel targeted by the government’s hostile messaging.\n\nIn Denmark, said Kristina Bakkaer Simonsen, an expert on immigration at the University of Aarhus, “immigrants have lower levels of political trust and democratic satisfaction,” adding, “This is particularly pronounced among Muslim immigrants and those with less education.”\n\nProfessor Simonsen said it was hard to pinpoint how much of the drop in Denmark’s asylum claims was because of its policies. After a spike in 2015, fueled by wars in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, asylum claims fell across Europe. But Denmark’s share of claims also shrank relative to its neighbors.\n\nThe Danish government’s cutback of welfare benefits to asylum seekers played a part in that decline, she said. But it also led to more refugees living in poverty, which contributed to an increase in crime and poorer results in education.\n\nCritics said the proposals would carry the same risks for Britain, which has already evolved from being one of the most liberal countries in Europe toward asylum seekers — approving 76 percent of claims in 2022 — to the middle of the pack, approving 48 percent in the first half of 2024.\n\n“Plans to leave refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty about where and if they can rebuild their lives are not just performative cruelty, they are counterproductive to integration and the economy,” Stella Creasy, a Labour member of Parliament, posted on social media on Monday.\n\nCritics took particular umbrage at what one minister said was a plan to confiscate valuables, including jewelry, from arriving asylum seekers to help defray the cost of housing and feeding them. The government later clarified that it would not seize jewelry or goods with sentimental value at the border.\n\n“The jewelry proposal is performative cruelty with terrible historical resonances for those who benefited from sanctuary in Britain,” said Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a research organization in London, referring to those who fled the Holocaust during World War II. Mr. Katwala said he understood “the pressure to show control, but it must be control with compassion.”\n\nPresenting the plan in Parliament on Monday, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, alluded to riots that have broken out at hotels housing asylum seekers in the past year. Overhauling the system, she said, was critical to averting further social unrest.\n\n“To the British public, the system feels out of control and unfair,” Ms. Mahmood said. “To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must establish order and control.”\n\nThe government hopes the plan will help Britain curb the flow of asylum seekers who cross the English Channel in often unseaworthy boats. Nearly 40,000 people have made such hazardous crossings so far this year, more than in the same period last year, though behind the record-setting pace in 2022.\n\nWith its outmoded policies toward asylum seekers, Ms. Mahmood said, Britain had fallen behind other European countries in controlling the influx of these migrants. In 2024, she said, asylum claims in Britain increased by 18 percent, a record level; across Europe, they fell by 13 percent.\n\nUnder the new proposals, people granted asylum would receive 30 months of residency, after which their claims would be reassessed and they would face deportation if they were no longer “considered in need of protection.” If their home countries were judged to be safe, they would be returned on a fast-track basis.\n\nUnder the current policy, asylum claims are decided only once and refugees are granted permission to remain in Britain for five years, after which they can apply for permanent settlement. Refugees in the new system would be eligible for permanent settlement only after 20 years.\n\nBritain said it would stop issuing visas to countries that do not cooperate in taking back refugees. Officials singled out Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo as potential targets for that penalty.\n\nThe government will also reduce benefits to asylum seekers, encouraging them to find work or otherwise pay for their own accommodation. And the government will remove a legal obligation to provide support to all asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute.\n\n“The challenge governments face is that they have a conflict between two goals,” said Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “They want to reduce the number of refugees. But if people are realistically going to spend the rest of their lives in the country, they want them to integrate.”\n\n“The same set of policies that are used to deter people from coming are also policies that make it harder for them to integrate,” she said.\n\nMuch about the plan remained unclear on Monday. Officials said they did not have estimates for how the new rules would affect small-boat crossings, asylum claims or wider immigration numbers.\n\nPolitics, as much as policy, is driving the plan. Mr. Starmer is desperate to fend off pressure from the right, particularly the anti-immigration party Reform U.K., which has amassed a double-digit lead over Labour in the polls, in part because of its exploitation of anxieties about uncontrolled immigration.\n\nBut the qualms expressed by Labour lawmakers should be a warning to the government, according to political analysts. Mr. Starmer has been forced to back down on previous proposals, like a cutback in welfare benefits, after they provoked a backlash in his party.\n\nThe government, they said, could find itself in the unenviable situation where it antagonizes its supporters without winning favor from the anti-immigration right.\n\n“We seem to be in a kind of doom loop where they make some bombastic declaration that gets picked up by the tabloids and alarms their base,” said Robert Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. “Then they row back and pretend, ‘That’s not what we meant at all.’”\n\nLizzie Dearden contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/well/ai-chatbot-doctors-health-care-advice.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:58:32-05:00","title":"Frustrated by the Medical System, Patients Turn to A.I.","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As patients grow increasingly frustrated with the lack of specific, actionable medical advice from traditional healthcare providers, more Americans—especially younger adults—are turning to artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot to obtain accurate health information.

She hoped her primary care provider could tell her exactly how much was enough.\n\nShe dashed off a message, but the response left her feeling that the doctor hadn’t read her question, or even her chart. The doctor offered generic advice: Stop smoking (she doesn’t smoke), avoid alcohol (she doesn’t drink), exercise regularly (she works out three times a week). Most infuriatingly, she was advised to eat “adequate protein to support bone health,” no specifics included.\n\nFrustrated, Ms. Goldberg posed the same question to ChatGPT. Within seconds, it produced a daily protein goal in grams.\n\nShe shot back one last message to her doctor: “I can get more information from ChatGPT than I can from you.”\n\nMs. Goldberg didn’t really trust ChatGPT, she said, but she had also become “disillusioned with the state of corporate medical care.”\n\nDriven in part by frustrations with the medical system, more and more Americans are seeking advice from A.I.

Could Give’\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T12:50:38-05:00\n\nA cadre of Dallas Cowboys players chased after the football as it tumbled into the end zone under the bright lights of “Monday Night Football.” In a flash, one player emerged in front of the pack — a 268-pound defensive end who smothered the ball for a touchdown.\n\nTo most Cowboys fans, it was 6 points scored on a blocked punt. But to many in western Michigan, it was the culmination of a lifetime of hard work for the funny but quiet, sports- and video-games-obsessed guy they knew, Marshawn Kneeland, who had spent 24 years outrunning circumstances, loss and doubt to make the N.F.L.\n\nThat touchdown on Nov. 3 was his first in the league, and the congratulatory texts flooded in, including from one of his college coaches. The next day, Mr. Kneeland was still buzzing from the touchdown, and he told the coach, Lou Esposito, that he planned to come back to Michigan that week. Mr. Kneeland said he had something to share. Mr. Esposito asked him what it was. “Good news,” he responded.\n\nTwo nights later, Mr. Kneeland was dead, following what the authorities in Texas said was a police chase, a crash and, then, a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThe case raised questions that have yet to be answered, in part because the authorities have released few details about what happened after officers tried to pull him over for a traffic violation. Why did Mr. Kneeland try to flee, and why did he have a gun in the car?\n\nPolice dispatch audio captured the Cowboys’ security director telling law enforcement that Mr. Kneeland had sent concerning texts, appearing to say goodbye and saying that he could not go to prison.\n\nIt was an abrupt and devastating end for a man who seemed to have achieved his dreams — a multimillion-dollar contract, a tight inner circle of friends and a girlfriend who had recently become pregnant with their child.\n\n“He was so excited about growth,” said Brandon Kimble, his high school coach, who remembers praying about the future with Mr. Kneeland and his girlfriend, Catalina Mancera, in their kitchen north of Dallas just a month ago. “It’s just so hard, and it makes it even harder,” he said.\n\nThe football field at Godwin Heights High School sits in Wyoming, Mich., just outside Grand Rapids, and is encircled by a running track. The field and track are bordered on one side by a creek and railroad tracks, and on the other by a quiet residential street. After school let out one night last week, the field was empty except for a teenager kicking a soccer ball.\n\nMr. Kneeland spent much of his childhood in a house close enough that he could walk to school. His older sister, Yahmya, remembers spending long days outside, playing tag and laughing. Back then, she said, her brother liked to draw and dance to whatever music was on, but he always had a singular focus on athletics. Teachers told him he needed a backup plan to his dreams of playing in the N.F.L., but he had only the one goal.\n\nMr. Kneeland was raised at times by his mother and father and at times by his father’s parents. His mother, Wendy, worked in human resources for UPS, and his father, Shawn, mostly held odd jobs. His father had been a high school basketball star in Grand Rapids but was jailed several times during Mr. Kneeland’s childhood and was recently sentenced to prison on drug and gun charges.\n\nYahmya Kneeland said that she could see her mother’s drive, focus and work ethic in her brother. Neither ever made excuses. Part of his drive also came from wanting to take care of them, she said. Despite being the younger brother, Mr. Kneeland had a tattoo on his left arm that read: “My sister’s protector.” She matched it with one on her forearm: “My brother’s keeper.”\n\nGodwin Heights has long been known as a basketball school, and when Mr. Kneeland arrived, no football player had ever received a scholarship offer from a Division I college, Mr. Kimble said.\n\nMr. Kimble, who is now the school’s athletic director, took over as football coach when Mr. Kneeland was a senior, in the fall of 2018. He had so much talent that he played on both sides of the ball — as a lineman on defense and as a tight end on offense.\n\nBut even with Mr. Kneeland’s star power, the season started off rocky, and the Godwin Heights Wolverines entered their fifth game with only one win under their belt. In that game, on the road about 100 miles north, the team was down, 21-0, at halftime, but Mr. Kneeland, who usually played on the edge of the defensive line, recognized that the team was getting beat by runs up the middle. He asked his coaches to move him to the interior defensive tackle position to help plug the gap.\n\n“I don’t think they gained over 15 yards once we got into the second half,” Mr. Kimble said. The team scored 28 unanswered points, winning by a touchdown.\n\nAfter that, the team didn’t lose another game that season, sweeping the next four to earn a spot in the playoffs.\n\n“The thing that turned our season around was literally Marshawn taking over the game,” Mr. Kimble said.\n\nAt that time, Mr. Esposito — now the defensive line coach at the University of Michigan — was the defensive coordinator at Western Michigan University. He was keeping an eye on Mr. Kneeland and remembers going to see him play a basketball game that winter and watching him fly up and down the court.\n\nIt was a done deal — Mr. Kneeland was going to be playing Division I football.\n\nThose who knew Mr. Kneeland said he was never the loudest in a room — perhaps he was even on the quiet side — but would burst out of his shell to crack a joke or when the topic turned to his interests: video games and anime TV shows.\n\nSometimes, it was surprising how much he kept to himself. Early on in college, he had surgery scheduled for Christmas Eve to fix an injured shoulder and was planning to simply return to his dorm room afterward. Mr. Esposito found out about it and picked Mr. Kneeland up from the hospital; they spent Christmas at Mr. Esposito’s home, with Mr. Kneeland playing video games and hanging out with the coach’s four children.\n\nOver his five years at Western Michigan, people were struck with his work ethic, whether he was studying film or working out in the gym. Sometimes, he needed to be told to take a break from the weights.\n\n“He went so hard all the time,” Mr. Esposito said.\n\nBut Mr. Kneeland also had a soft side. In his second year on the team, he noticed that Mr. Esposito was visibly upset about having recently lost his father. “No one can take the memories away,” Mr. Kneeland told him.\n\nMr. Esposito remembered that advice when, in February 2024, Mr. Kneeland’s mother died from an accidental overdose. Mr. Kneeland was in Florida, preparing for the N.F.L. combine, an event where college players show off their skills in front of professional scouts ahead of the draft.\n\nMr. Esposito drove down and found him distraught. “I said to him, ‘You remember what you told me, right?’” The combine can be a make-or-break experience, but Mr. Kneeland was close to skipping it altogether. Jon Perzley, his agent, said he had tried to assure Mr. Kneeland that teams would understand if he needed to be elsewhere. “Nobody will give you any kind of problems,” he remembers saying.\n\nMr. Kneeland thought about it and came to a conclusion: His mother would want him out on the field. In fact, she would be disappointed if he weren’t.\n\n“He always told her he was going to the N.F.L., he was going to take care of her. That was his goal,” Mr. Kimble said. “He wanted to go make her proud.”\n\nMr. Perzley said he had already known that Mr. Kneeland was strong-willed, but his standout performance at the combine put him at another level.\n\n“It’s the most important five or six days of his life, and his mother just died,” Mr. Perzley said. “And right there I said, ‘This kid is different.’”\n\nA few days later, in March 2024, Mr. Kneeland returned home for his mother’s memorial service. He told those at the church that his mother had always been there, supporting him on cold nights at the football field and from afar.\n\nWhen she died so unexpectedly, he said, “it tore me apart.”\n\n“One thing that helped me get through it is that I could still feel her,” he said. The next month, in April 2024, Mr. Kneeland sat surrounded by his family and friends in Michigan, as the Dallas Cowboys called his name in the second round of the draft. His sister reached out on a video call from South Korea, where she was stationed in the Army.\n\nGreg Ellis, then an assistant defensive line coach for the Cowboys, said Mr. Kneeland had come in with as much hustle as anyone.\n\n“The kid gave all he could give in every aspect of his life,” he said, adding that Mr. Kneeland was the player whom coaches would point out to other players and say, “Do you see how hard he’s working?”\n\nMr. Kneeland fell in love with the Dallas area. If he could, he wanted to play with the Cowboys for his entire career, friends said. And he was becoming more of an adult, Mr. Kimble said, talking with Ms. Mancera about their future: marriage, children, buying a home. His sister, still in the Army, had recently moved to San Antonio.\n\nOn the first game of the N.F.L. season, Mr. Kneeland recorded his first career sack. Then, two months later, his first touchdown.\n\nThe police have given only a basic description of the night he died, saying that he sped off when Texas state troopers tried to stop his car for a traffic violation. He managed to get away briefly but crashed his car next to a highway north of Dallas. When the police searched near the crash, they found him dead.\n\nThe Cowboys were heading into a week off at the time. A teammate posted a photograph later in the week of flowers beneath Mr. Kneeland’s locker. On Monday night, the Cowboys will play their first game since his death.\n\nHis friends and family said they did not want to speak about his death or what might have been running through his mind. Not only is it too soon and too painful, they said, but he also should be remembered as much more than the football player who killed himself.\n\nInstead, they have tried to console one another.\n\nYahmya Kneeland has spent time recently with Ms. Mancera, grieving their loss, and said she had been thinking about how people live on through one another.\n\nAfter his mother’s death, Mr. Kneeland wore a small capsule containing some of her ashes on a chain around his neck. Ms. Kneeland’s 5-year-old daughter had always called him “Uncle Buddy,” his mother’s nickname for him. Now, Ms. Kneeland says, her brother will live on through his child with Ms. Mancera.\n\nMr. Esposito says he has been haunted by Mr. Kneeland’s comment that he had something to share with him. Was the “good news” that he expected to soon be a father? Was it something else? All of it, Mr. Esposito said, is “brutal.”\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.\n\nBernard Mokam and Edgar Sandoval contributed reporting, and Georgia Gee contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/arts/dance/dancers-ballet-mental-health-therapy.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:08-05:00","title":"Instead of ‘Gritting Our Teeth,’ Ballet Dancers Opt for Therapy","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sara Mearns, a principal dancer with New York City Ballet, began addressing her mental health in 2021 after struggling with performance anxiety and emotional distress following her return to the stage.

started to pay attention to her mental health in a serious way around the fall of 2021, when the company returned to the stage after the pandemic shuttered theaters the year before. She felt strong. During lockdown she had worked constantly, barely taking a break.\n\n“I didn’t accept that this was happening, that I was losing out on a year and a half of my career performing-wise,” she said in one of a series of interviews, starting in 2022.\n\nMearns said she felt like she had to return to the stage at a top level — dancing as she had been when the world shut down. But on City Ballet’s opening night that fall, during George Balanchine’s “Symphony in C,” she missed a turn in the finale.\n\n“How could I miss that turn?” she recalled thinking. It started a downward spiral. She felt everything she did onstage was wrong. “I was crying after every show,” she said.\n\nTo compensate, she over rehearsed, which left her body in shambles. “I was just hobbling and barely making it onstage.” She realized some of this was her own doing: “I could have said, ‘I can’t do these shows.’” But she kept going.\n\nThe retirement of the longtime principal Maria Kowroski that season affected Mearns in a way she couldn’t have predicted.\n\n“‘Oh my God, am I in her shoes now?’” Mearns said of the leadership responsibilities of being a senior ballerina. “I don’t know if I can handle this.”\n\nAfter Kowroski’s farewell performance, Mearns said she crawled under her dressing room table and sobbed. The next morning she found herself weeping on a park bench. She knew this was not OK. She texted Marika Molnar, City Ballet’s health and wellness coordinator, and told her that she needed help.\n\nThat was the start of Mearns’s “therapy journey,” she said, “and finally talking about my issues and my traumas from childhood and from relationships and career and injuries. How it all is so intertwined.”\n\nA dancer is sometimes called an instrument. But an instrument, even one completely in tune, doesn’t have a mind.\n\nA dancer is a body — and a mind. Mearns, in speaking openly about her mental health, has led the way to normalizing discussions of the topic for ballet dancers. That frankness feeds into a change in ballet culture that took on greater urgency during the pandemic. Dancers began to question their careers and who they were apart from being dancers. Some saw their bodies change. Some decided to have children. And many started paying closer attention to their mental well-being.\n\nMany workplaces, schools and college campuses are trying to provide more mental health services. But ballet faces special challenges.\n\nSerious students often leave their families as teenagers to train, making adult decisions before their prefrontal cortices are fully developed. For dancers lucky enough to get into a company, pressure comes from all sides. They need to deal with a constant stream of corrections. They must learn to take of their bodies and to deal with injuries. And there is the stress of stepping in last minute if another dancer is ill or injured, which could be the kind of break that leads to a meaningful career.\n\nThe pressure never lets up. All dancers have to deal with the mirror, a punishing aid in which bodies are on full display and ripe for comparison. Weight, too much or too little, can be an issue. Some dancers grapple with eating disorders or substance abuse. Injuries can lead dancers to wonder what they are without dance.\n\nBallet companies can’t solve all of dancers’ problems. But now, after decades of neglecting dancers’ emotional health, companies and schools are taking steps to prioritize the whole dancer, body and mind.\n\nAnd dancers are showing that seeking therapy isn’t a sign of weakness, but a proactive approach to becoming a better artist — the kind who doesn’t dance through injuries but addresses them, mentally as well as physically.\n\n“It’s a real game of balance through your whole life,” said Wendy Whelan, the associate director of City Ballet and a former principal. “Finding that balance between your body and your mind. Your chemistry inside.”\n\nA similar taboo about mental health is being broken in sports, as major athletes like Simone Biles, Kevin Love and Naomi Osaka talk publicly about their struggles, pushing back at the idea that it’s a failing in an arena that prizes mental toughness and grit.\n\nStill, sports psychologists are an ordinary part of an athlete’s life. There’s no equivalent for dancers.\n\n“It’s one of the biggest things that’s lacking in ballet, because all sports get that kind of coaching,” said Susan Jaffe, the artistic director of American Ballet Theater. In dance “you have to go out there and do really, really hard things. And how do you do that if you’ve got a lot of fear or you don’t have confidence?”\n\nMolnar, who started with City Ballet in 1980 as a physical therapist at the request of Balanchine, the company’s founding choreographer, has been thinking about mental health for decades. But when she started, it was thought of as a different specialty. “It was psychology or psychiatry,” she said. “It wasn’t part of the same field.”\n\nAt City Ballet, there wasn’t an emphasis on mental health until the company brought in SportStrata, which specializes in performance coaching and sports psychology, before the pandemic.\n\n“They presented ideas of how to take care of health in all ways, not just being strong and conditioned and ballet ready,” Molnar said. “But their whole body outside the ballet as well.”\n\nCity Ballet, in partnership with SportStrata, now makes performance coaching and sports psychology available to dancers in group sessions or one on one.\n\nWhen Whelan danced in the company, from 1984 to 2014, things were different. “We had to find our own mentors,” she said. “We had to deal with our own mental health privately or with a friend. But nobody wanted to talk about it because that was a weakness, and that was not looked well upon.”\n\nIt meant you were fragile, it meant you could be broken, that you might be judged. Whelan found a therapist on her own, when she was in her 20s, and said she couldn’t have handled her career without one. “I luckily found the right person at the right time, but that was my own thing,” she said. “I did it on Mondays, and it armed me and it gave me tools to get through the career.”\n\nNow at City Ballet, dancers are offered life coach sessions with Carla Körbes, Juilliard’s ballet chair and a former company member. Körbes said that even if mental health programs in ballet are not yet fully formed, the conversation has been started.\n\n“We just need to land in a place where there’s no fear around it,” she said. “No, we’re not making everybody soft and petting them. What I actually do is shift their minds from blaming everybody else to ‘this is what I have control of.’”\n\nMany companies have broadened their wellness programs to include mental health, including San Francisco Ballet, where it is overseen by Antonio Castilla, the company’s associate artistic director. A former company member who experienced problems with mental health, Castilla meets with dancers at least twice a year.\n\n“I want to know where the dancers are,” he said. “Even if they’re not in maybe such a good place, I’d rather know than not know.”\n\nProactive steps are also being taken at the student level, when addressing mental health can help prevent problems later, said Aubrey Lynch II, dean of students and the wellness director of American Ballet Theater. “My work is making sure the pipeline starts so that when they are in a company, they are aware.”\n\nThe School of American Ballet — the training ground for City Ballet — has opened a new artistic health and wellness student center. Designed by Verona Carpenter Architects, it opened in September for intermediate and advanced students, and cost $4.2 million.\n\nOne aim of the center is normalizing the need for support. Students can book sessions with mental health counselors and nutritionists using a confidential online system.\n\nJennifer Carpenter, the principal architect, wants students to feel safe and secure there, she said, for it to be “a place where you’re not under scrutiny.”\n\nStudents told her that along with constantly being observed by their teachers, they felt other eyes on them, too. “They’re also role models for the younger students,” Carpenter said. “So this could be the place where they can sort of be themselves.”\n\nMental health issues affect all dancers, not just those in ballet and its comparatively well-funded institutions. “Dancers are notorious for not reaching out for help,” said Bebe Neuwirth, the dancer and actress, who founded the Dancers’ Resource at the Entertainment Community Fund (formerly the Actors Fund). “We are notorious for gritting our teeth and getting through it.”\n\nThat’s because “we are at the bottom of the food chain in the arts,” she added. “We are paid less than anyone else. And we are the most replaceable.”\n\nNeuwirth formed the Dancers’ Resource after having a hip replacement. “I was in my mid-40s,” she said, “and I was still dancing — and then I was limping, and I was not able to go to ballet class, and it was very, very difficult emotionally.”\n\nShe saw others dealing with similar problems. “Most dancers don’t have the financial means to get their own independent private help,” she said. “Most dancers can’t afford to hire a therapist and work through this pain.”\n\nDancers’ Resource helps with financial assistance for all types of dancers, in all stages of their careers. Mario Ismael Espinoza, a former member of Ballet Hispanico, is a social worker there.\n\nFormer dancers, Espinoza said, understand “being in a space like dance that can be so harmful psychologically, but creates so many strengths,” adding that “they’re intertwined. The same things that are harmful also build resilience and work ethic and strength.”\n\nMearns knows that therapy works. Over the years, she has shared her struggles on social media, including announcing that she had been suffering from hearing loss for years. In 2022, her dog died suddenly, which she posted about on Instagram. “It flipped something in me,” she said.\n\n“I was like, I’m here again,” she said. “How am I here again?”\n\nShe texted her therapist, who told her that she was never alone and that “‘you can literally walk to the emergency room.’”\n\nMearns says some days are better than others, but through extensive therapy, she feels free. “I’ve never really felt this,” she said. “I’ve always just been pleasing people and sort of surrendering myself to the situations and not having my own voice and not putting my foot down.”\n\nNow, because of therapy — which, she stressed, “is very, very hard work” — she sees the world with different eyes. She is in the beginning stages of developing a platform for dancers and companies to address mental health.\n\nRecently, Mearns hit her head in an elevator, which led to a serious concussion. She was confined to her apartment, where everything was off limits except sleeping, showering and eating. Mearns was able to return to the stage before the fall season ended, but the accident taught her a lot.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever been this healthy in my entire career as a person,” she said. “It was a big wake-up call in terms of health for my entire body, and that affects your mental state.”\n\nOver the past year, Mearns has felt more present onstage than at any point in her career. “This is another level that I didn’t think was possible,” she said. “It’s because of the work that I’ve done to value who I am offstage and to take care of myself that I have been able to do that.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/maga-republicans-trump-epstein.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:09:00-05:00","title":"The MAGA Crackup Might Finally Be Here","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump faced growing internal resistance from Republican lawmakers, including Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene, over their efforts to push a transparency measure on Jeffrey Epstein’s files.

2025-11-17T19:09:00-05:00\n\nThis weekend, Donald Trump picked a fight with two Republicans in Congress and lost.\n\nThe president has reportedly been apoplectic  about a House vote, which could come as soon as Tuesday, ordering the Justice Department to release its files on the sex-trafficking financier Jeffrey Epstein. On Friday attacked Thomas Massie, the eccentric conservative who, along with the California Democrat Ro Khanna, spearheaded a maneuver to bypass House leadership and force the Epstein measure to the floor. Massie’s wife of three decades died unexpectedly last year, and on social media, Trump mocked him for remarrying. “Boy, that was quick!” he wrote, adding, “His wife will soon find out that she’s stuck with a LOSER!”\n\nThen, on Saturday, Trump lashed out at Marjorie Taylor Greene, a MAGA die-hard who has been loudly demanding transparency on Epstein, calling her, among other things, a traitor.\n\nTrump seemed to be trying to dissuade other Republicans from voting yes on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Khanna wrote. But many were still planning to defect, with Massie predicting as many as 100 Republicans might join him. Such defiance, Khanna told me, would show “how weak Trump’s hold is becoming on his own caucus, and it may signal the beginning of the end of Trump’s dominance.”\n\nPerhaps Trump agreed, because on Sunday night he reversed course, announcing that Republicans should go ahead and vote for the release of the Epstein files. In doing so, he avoided a humiliating public rebuke. What he cannot avoid, however, is the growing disillusionment among conservatives with their deeply unpopular lame-duck leader.\n\nThe last wretched decade shows that reports of a MAGA crackup ought to be viewed somewhat skeptically. There have, after all, been many moments when Trump seemed to be losing his grip on the right, only for his hold to grow stronger.\n\nBut a few things are different now. In his first term, Trump inherited a good economy from Barack Obama, and the establishment Republicans who surrounded him prevented him from tanking it with major trade wars or mass deportations. Much of Trump’s base distrusted these figures, seeing them as part of a deep state cabal trying to thwart his populist agenda. But they shielded the country from at least part of the price of Trump’s erraticism.\n\nThis time, however, Trump came into office with a much shakier economy, and, unrestrained by Washington technocrats, has proceeded to make it worse, putting the country in a sour mood. “The five-alarm fire is health care and affordability for Americans,” Greene told Politico. “And that’s where the focus should be.”\n\nFor a while, Republicans could dismiss polls showing public unhappiness with Trump as fake news. Such denial has become harder in the wake of this month’s elections, in which Democrats made outsize gains virtually everywhere. As Axios has reported, Republicans are now worried about the possibility of a Democratic upset in a Tennessee district that Trump won by 22 points.\n\nWhen a president becomes a drag on his party, it can have a psychological effect on partisans. Suddenly, flaws they’d barely registered come into focus. (Recall, for example, how many Democrats refused to see Joe Biden’s age-related decline until it became a political emergency.) We may never see a Republican stampede away from Trump, but some of his supporters are experiencing a moment of clarity about his character.\n\nEven before this weekend, many conservatives were livid about an interview he gave to Laura Ingraham of Fox News explaining the need for H1-B visas, which American employers use to hire foreign workers for certain high-skilled jobs. The visas, Trump told Ingraham, were necessary to bring in talent. “We have plenty of talented people,” Ingraham said. “No, you don’t,” Trump replied.\n\nTo many Trump supporters, angry about both immigration and an increasingly bleak job market, his words were a slap in the face. “We’ve never seen an administration crash and burn in its first year so badly,” wrote Anthony Sabatini, a Republican county commissioner in Florida.\n\nA few days later, Mike Cernovich, the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theorist and MAGA influencer, posted a surprising critique of the administration. During a visit to Washington, he wrote, “the talk of everyone was how overt the corruption was. It’s at levels you read about in history books.” Many, he said, were asking, “Do people just think Democrats will never win and they’ll all get away with this?”\n\nNow, no remotely savvy person can be surprised by this White House’s epic graft. When Trump was riding high, his acolytes appeared to enjoy watching his vulgar profiteering trigger Democrats. But as Trump burns up political capital on personal enrichment, some on the right might be starting to suspect that it’s not just the libs being owned.\n\nIt was against this backdrop of conservative disaffection that Trump rebuked Greene and Massie. Many right-wing influencers reacted with unusual fury, some posting images of burning MAGA hats. Trisha Hope, a Texas Republican who was at Trump’s rally on Jan. 6, wrote that she was no longer entertained by Trump, and was “beginning to find him repulsive.” Scott Morefield, a columnist for the right-wing site Townhall, called Trump’s posts “cruel in a way that should make any human with basic empathy question what kind of human he is.”\n\nIt would be easy here to make a crack about leopards eating faces. But in the past, when Trump has turned on Republicans, his base has tended to follow. Trump ended the political careers of Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, once a darling of the Tea Party; Bob Good, former chair of the right-wing House Freedom caucus; and his own first vice president, Mike Pence. His inability to stand up to Greene and Massie suggests that something has changed.\n\nTrump’s grudging endorsement of the Epstein Files Transparency Act is kind of absurd, since he could, if he wanted, simply instruct the Justice Department to release the files. Even if Khanna’s bill passes the House, Trump will have levers to thwart the files’ disclosure. Republicans might kill the measure in the Senate, where it needs 60 votes. Last week, under pressure from Trump, the Justice Department announced an investigation into prominent Democrats who’ve been associated with Epstein, and the administration may say it needs to keep the files under wraps while that inquiry is open.\n\nBut even if the files never come out, it’s increasingly clear that the MAGA coalition is fragmenting. On Monday, I asked Morefield how significant he thought the fissures in the movement were. “I think it’s pretty serious,” he said. “Epstein really started it. It was like the crack in the dam, I think.”\n\nEven if the dam holds for a while longer, we can now see how brittle it is.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Effort on the Runway to Raise Climate Funds\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T12:11:26-05:00\n\nIt could eventually be the world’s first wealth tax.\n\nA handful of countries are taking baby steps to impose a fee on private jets and first- and business-class seats on flights taking off from their airports. The proceeds would help all the countries that join the coalition adapt to climate change.\n\n“Those who pollute more should contribute more, and a levy on premium fliers can generate billions for climate resilience, adaptation and sustainable development,” said Maria del Mar Fernández-Palacios, a Spanish diplomat. She was representing her country at an event at the COP30 climate talks to draw other countries to join the Premium Flyers Solidarity Coalition, as they call themselves.\n\nThey’re a long way from raising billions, though.\n\nSpain is among only two industrialized countries, along with France, that support this effort. The majority are countries from where few premium flights depart but that stand to gain from the potential proceeds: Benin, Djibouti, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia and South Sudan. Four countries have joined the coalition as observers,: Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, Fiji and Vanuatu.\n\nAviation accounts for around 4 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that are raising global temperatures to dangerous levels, with private jets and first-class seats standing out for a disproportionate share of pollution per passenger.\n\nIn a statement, the International Air Transport Association, a global trade group, called the proposed tax “exasperating and disappointing.”\n\nThe association said the industry had already pledged to reduce its climate pollution in other ways. That includes efforts to make planes more fuel-efficient, using biofuels and offsetting the emissions of air travel with carbon credits, which have been criticized as ineffective. The European Commission’s consumer protection authority has called the advertising claims for the offsets “misleading.”\n\nCountries currently have a range of existing taxes on aviation. Some tax all flights equally. The 27-country European Union imposes an additional tax on private jets. Maldives has a staggered system of taxes, with private jet passengers paying nearly 10 times what economy class passengers pay. France imposes different fees based on both the class and the distance of the flight: On a per passenger basis, a first-class seat on a short-haul flight is taxed at a higher rate than an economy seat on a long haul. Very few countries use the proceeds from aviation taxes for climate measures.\n\nThe would-be premium passenger tax aims to change that.\n\nThe terms are still vague. The structure of such a tax could vary by country, depending on how they currently tax aviation. When it takes effect depends on the national governments that join the effort. And it remains to be seen whether countries with the busiest airports, including the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Britain, will agree to join this voluntary coalition.\n\nStill, it’s notable because it is potentially a source of new money at a time when there is very little new money to help countries cope with the hazards of a hotter planet. Rich countries promised to raise $40 billion a year for lower income countries for climate adaptation measures, per year. They barely raised $26 billion.\n\nWhat’s especially attractive to low and middle-income countries is that the proposed tax is designed to raise cash rather than extend loans. Many of these countries are already drowning in debt. They are wary of taking on new debt to pay for climate adaptation measures.\n\n“It’s very simple. We need new resources that don’t create debt, that are predictable and that have some rationality for sectors that pollute,” Laurence Tubiana, a French diplomat who has led the negotiations for the proposed tax, said in a recent interview. “It will be difficult. There will be resistance.”\n\nThis strategy to build a voluntary coalition reflects an effort to bypass conventional international agreements under United Nations rules that require global consensus or a majority of countries to vote in favor of a given measure. In reality, many times, those sorts of international agreements collapse in negotiation.\n\nThe latest example of that was a long-awaited vote on a carbon tax on the shipping industry at the International Maritime Organization, a U.N. agency. The United States led a vociferous attack on it, threatening visa restrictions and other sanctions against countries that backed it. The proposed measure was deferred by a year.\n\nThe proposed new jet tax comes after years of deliberations among policymakers and national leaders to figure out new ways of raising money. At the international climate talks two years ago, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, a task force was formed by the leaders of Barbados, France and Kenya. In June of this year, eight governments backed the idea of a tax on private jets, along with first-class and business flights. Since then, Barbados backed out. Djibouti, Nigeria and South Sudan joined.\n\nDemand for high-end travel has surged over the last five years in the United States. Two of the biggest U.S.-based airlines, Delta and United, have seen revenue from premium flights increase so handsomely that they could soon rival revenue from economy seats.\n\nNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/opinion/venezuela-trump-maduro.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:00:05-05:00","title":"The Case for Overthrowing Maduro","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article argues that U.S. intervention is necessary to remove Nicolás Maduro from power in Venezuela, citing moral failure, regional instability, and economic exploitation.

“sort of” made up his mind about his plan for Venezuela, but he “can’t tell you what it would be.” With an aircraft carrier strike group and some 15,000 service personnel deployed to the region, it’s sort of hard to imagine that the president’s decision will be to stand down and go home.\n\nI’ve been outspoken in calling on the administration to act against Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship in Caracas — a column I wrote in January ran under the headline “Depose Maduro.” With war looming, possibly within days, it’s worth making the case again — and thinking through the ways it could go wrong.\n\nLet’s take it point by point.\n\nIs there a vital American interest at stake? There is, and it’s not just the one the administration keeps talking about: drugs.\n\nNot that there’s much doubt that the regime is deeply implicated in the drug trade, even if there are questions about whether Maduro runs an actual cartel. The most careful analysis I know of, a 2022 report by the InSight Crime think tank, notes that the “principal role” of the president and his henchmen is “to ensure the drug trafficking system functions to the benefit of the regime by placing corrupt and loyal personnel in strategic political and military positions.”\n\nBut the larger challenge posed by Maduro’s regime is that it is both an importer and exporter of instability. An importer, because the regime’s close economic and strategic ties to China, Russia and Iran give America’s enemies a significant foothold in the Americas — one that Tehran reportedly could use for the production of kamikaze drones. An exporter, because the regime’s catastrophic misgovernance has generated a mass exodus of refugees and migrants — nearly eight million so far — with ruinous results throughout the hemisphere. Both trends will continue for as long as the regime remains in power.\n\nAre there viable alternatives to conflict? Economic sanctions against the regime in Trump’s first term have worked about as well as economic sanctions usually do — immiserating ordinary people while allowing the regime to entrench itself through its control of ever-scarcer goods. The Biden administration sought détente with the regime by easing some of those sanctions, only to reinstate them after concluding that Maduro had reneged on promises of democratic reforms. Last year’s elections, which the opposition won in a rout, were stolen. The opposition leader María Corina Machado, winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, lives in hiding.\n\nThat leaves two plausible alternatives. The first, suggested by Maduro, is to give the United States a stake in Venezuela’s vast mineral wealth, effectively in exchange for allowing him to stay in power. To my surprise, Trump rejected that quasi-colonialist bargain. The second is to use a show of force to persuade Maduro and his senior officials to flee the country, much as Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and his cronies did. To my surprise, too, that hasn’t happened, either. At least not yet. On Sunday, Trump said he was mulling talks with Maduro, perhaps to make that latter option more attractive.\n\nIs there a moral case for regime change? Outside of North Korea, few governments have produced more misery for more of their own people than Venezuela’s. Starvation, political brutality, corruption, social collapse, endemic violence, collapse of the medical system, environmental catastrophes — the only thing more shocking than the self-destruction of this once-rich country is the relative indifference to the catastrophe, at least among the usual do-gooders who otherwise like to anguish over the plight of others. Why hasn’t Greta Thunberg set sail to Caracas with symbolic deliveries of food?\n\nAny morally serious person should want this to end. The serious question is whether American intervention would make things even worse.\n\nCould this turn into another fiasco? Intervention means war, and war means death: Even the swift and effective overthrow of Panama’s Manuel Noriega in 1989 led to the loss of 26 Americans and several hundred Panamanians. Maduro’s better-armed forces might put up a serious fight. Or they could retreat to the hinterland and start an insurgency, perhaps by joining up with the narco-insurgents across the border in Colombia.\n\nThe law of unintended consequences is unrepealable. But there are also important differences between Venezuela and Iraq or Libya. These include a democratically elected leader, Edmundo González, who could govern with immediate legitimacy and broad public support. They include Trump’s clear reluctance to put U.S. boots on the ground for any extended period. And they include the fact that we can learn from our past mistakes, not least by promising immediate amnesty and jobs for soldiers, police officers and civil servants in the current regime who aren’t implicated in its crimes.\n\nWhat is the balance of risk? Unintended consequences must be weighed against the predictable risks of inaction. If Trump stands down or conducts limited strikes against sites connected to the drug trade while allowing Maduro to survive, the Venezuelan dictator will see it, rightly, as a resounding victory and vindication. The U.S. will have succeeded only in strengthening his determination to hold on to power rather than relinquish it. And Trump’s hesitation will be read, especially in Moscow and Beijing, as a telling signal of weakness that can only embolden them, just as President Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan did.\n\nWhat is to be done? Maduro should be given a final chance to board a flight with whomever and whatever he can take with him and leave unharmed and unpursued — whether to Havana or Moscow or another friendly capital. Barring that, he deserves the Noriega treatment: capture and transfer to the U.S. to face charges, accompanied by the destruction of Venezuela’s air defenses and command-and-control capabilities, the seizure of its major military bases and arrest warrants for all senior officers — with promises of leniency for those who turn themselves in.\n\n“If you start to take Vienna, take Vienna,” Napoleon is said to have told one of his generals.

Links Measles Outbreaks in Multiple States for the First Time\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T19:25:15-05:00\n\nHealth officials on Monday linked for the first time the measles outbreak that began in Texas with another in Utah and Arizona, a finding that could end America’s status as a nation that has eliminated measles.\n\nThe news came in a phone call, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, among officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments.\n\nThe chain of transmission began in January, in a conservative Mennonite group on the western edge of Texas, and spread to Oklahoma and New Mexico.\n\nCountries lose their elimination status after 12 months of sustained transmission. If the outbreak cannot be extinguished by January, the anniversary of the first cases in Texas, the United States will lose what is known as “elimination status” as determined by the World Health Organization, which it has had for 25 years.\n\n“I wouldn’t call the code yet, but I think the patient’s not looking real good,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nCanada lost its status last week, ending a 27-year run, after failing to control an outbreak that began at a Mennonite gathering in October 2024.\n\nLosing elimination status may not lead to tangible changes, such as travel restrictions. But experts have called the possibility “deeply embarrassing” for a wealthy country with the medical resources of the United States.\n\nA representative from the Health and Human Services Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nThis month, the C.D.C. presented its outbreak information to the Pan American Health Organization. As of Nov. 13, the C.D.C. had confirmed 1,723 measles cases nationwide, 87 percent of which were associated with a record 45 outbreaks so far this year. By contrast, 16 outbreaks were reported in 2024.\n\nAbout 92 percent of the reported cases this year are among people who are either unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status.\n\nThe subtype of measles that is circulating, identified by the number 9171, first took hold on Jan. 20 in Gaines County, Texas, and “continues, unfortunately uninterrupted, across multiple jurisdictions,” said Dr. David Sugerman, who leads the C.D.C.’s measles response, on the call.\n\nThe country’s measles elimination status is “very much still under threat if we see that same sequence transmitting in current outbreaks ongoing through the end of January,” he said, when the outbreak will have been going on for a year.\n\nThe C.D.C. is working with health authorities in Canada and Mexico to share best practices and collaborate on decoding the genetic sequences of the measles virus, he added.\n\nThe outbreak in Utah and Arizona is currently the largest in the country, with more than 180 cases. Most new infections are among household members of infected individuals, but roughly one in four across both states have an unknown origin, suggesting that officials are missing some sources of exposure. About 7 percent of infections were contracted at congregate events, including weddings and other festivals.\n\nLocal public health officials in Utah said efforts to encourage vaccinations in the area have had “limited” impact. While there was an initial spike in vaccination rates when the outbreak first took root, progress has fallen off.\n\n“It would not surprise me in the least if there’s continued spread across these next several months,” said Dr. David Kimberlin, who sits on a panel of experts that analyzes measles data for the United States’ elimination status review.\n\nAnother large outbreak in two schools in South Carolina is close to being contained. Rockland County, N.Y., has four reported cases, the first since a massive outbreak in 2018 that lasted 10 months. That outbreak raced through Orthodox Jewish communities, some of which had vaccination rates below 70 percent.\n\n“Overall, the risk of widespread measles transmission in the United States remains low,” Dr. Sugerman said. But the virus may quickly move through close-knit communities where vaccination rates are low, he warned.\n\nThe infections in New York this year stem from two people traveling from Israel. In total, the United States has had 152 importations from at least 47 countries, including eight new ones just in the last two weeks.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/science/monarch-butterfly-migration-tracking-sensor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:49:21-05:00","title":"We Can Now Track Individual Monarch Butterflies.

Monarch Butterflies. It’s a Revelation.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T10:49:21-05:00\n\nFor the first time, scientists are tracking the migration of monarch butterflies across much of North America, actively monitoring individual insects on journeys from as far away as Ontario all the way to their overwintering colonies in central Mexico.\n\nThis long-sought achievement could provide crucial insights into the poorly understood life cycles of hundreds of species of butterflies, bees and other flying insects at a time when many are in steep decline.\n\nThe breakthrough is the result of a tiny solar-powered radio tag that weighs just 60 milligrams and sells for $200. Researchers have tagged more than 400 monarchs this year and are now following their journeys on a cellphone app created by the New Jersey-based company that makes the tags, Cellular Tracking Technologies.\n\nMost monarchs weigh 500 to 600 milligrams, so each tag-bearing migrator making the transcontinental journey is, by weight, equivalent to a half-raisin carrying three uncooked grains of rice.\n\nResearchers are tracking more than 400 tagged monarch butterflies as they fly toward winter colonies in central Mexico. The maps below follow six butterflies.\n\nDots show tracked locations, typically through nearby Bluetooth devices.\n\nLines show gaps in detection, often in remote locations or over water where there are fewer people and devices.\n\nMexico City\n\nDots show tracked locations, typically through nearby Bluetooth devices.\n\nLines show gaps in detection, often in remote locations or over water where there are fewer people and devices.\n\nMexico City\n\nDots show tracked locations, typically through nearby Bluetooth devices.\n\nLines show gaps in detection, often in remote locations or over water where there are fewer people and devices.\n\nMexico City\n\nSan Antonio\n\nMexico City\n\nSan Antonio\n\nMexico City\n\nSan Antonio\n\nMexico City\n\nSouth Abaco\n\nSan Antonio\n\nMexico City\n\nSan Antonio\n\nMexico City\n\nSouth Abaco\n\nSan Antonio\n\nMexico City\n\nSan Antonio\n\nMexico City\n\nTwo monarchs known as LPM021 and LPM084 were released on Sept. 13 and 28 in Long Point, Ontario. They flew past Mexico’s Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, where the largest colonies are located, toward smaller colonies to the southeast.\n\nJMU004 and MW026 were released on Sept. 23 and 27 and were the first tagged monarchs to reach the winter colonies, on Nov. 9.\n\nLAN003 took a coastal route from Pennsylvania into the Florida Keys. And CMP032 was probably blown out to sea from Cape May to the Bahamas before flying west to Florida.\n\nResearchers have theorized that some monarchs may reach Mexico from Florida by way of Cuba, while many others stay in Florida.\n\nSource: Project Monarch Collaboration data through Nov. 15.\n\n“There’s nothing that’s not amazing about this,” said Cheryl Schultz, a butterfly scientist at Washington State University and the senior author of a recent study documenting a 22 percent drop in butterfly abundance in North America over a recent 20-year period. The movements of monarchs and other flying insects are cloaked in mystery, and “now we will have answers that could help us turn the tide for these bugs.”\n\nTracking the world’s most famous insect migration may also have a big social impact, with monarch lovers able to follow the progress of individual butterflies on the free app, called Project Monarch Science. Many of the butterflies are flying over cities and suburbs where pollinator gardens are increasingly popular. Some tracks could even lead to the discovery of new winter hideaways.\n\n“It’s an incredible technological advance,” said Orley Taylor, a professor emeritus at the University of Kansas who goes by Chip and has spent more time studying the migration than any other living researcher.\n\nMonarch tracking has relied on low-tech methods ever since it began in 1935. The biggest current effort is led by Monarch Watch, founded by Dr. Taylor in 1992. The group oversees the annual sticker-tagging of more than 100,000 monarchs, though fewer than 1 percent are recovered in the winter colonies.\n\nEven when a monarch bearing a sticker tag is found, the information it yields is limited to the butterfly’s physical characteristics and the time and place it was tagged, with no details about the long journey in between. That’s like trying to make sense of an entire book from only its first and last pages.\n\nNow that those pages are being filled in, researchers can see that the story of the migration is even more dramatic than expected, with many monarchs blown far off course but using their strong wing muscles and remarkable navigational abilities to get back on track for Mexico.\n\n“We can already see that a lot of things we thought we knew about how these insects move are oversimplifications,” Dr. Taylor said.\n\nMonarchs have evolved two highly sophisticated navigational systems. Most of the time, they rely on a system that orients them in relation to the sun, keeping them pointed south throughout the day by compensating for the sun’s movements across the sky. When clouds get in the way, monarchs switch to a backup compass that relies on ultraviolet light to detect the angle of the Earth’s magnetic field.\n\nTheir twin compasses usually keep migrating monarchs headed in the correct general direction. But how the butterflies manage to locate the same isolated colonies their great-great grandparents occupied the year before is a longstanding mystery.\n\nNo more than one in four is likely to survive the journey, with the rest succumbing to unfavorable winds, hungry birds, vehicle traffic or sheer exhaustion, among other perils.\n\nThe migrators who manage to reach the colonies join a spectacle in which huge flocks circle overhead in kaleidoscopic whirls and roost so thickly on fir trees that even the sturdiest branches bend under their collective weight.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people annually hike up 10,000-foot mountains to witness this phenomenon, but the multigenerational migratory cycle that sustains it is under growing stress.\n\nIn the 1990s, the winter population at the Mexican colonies was regularly estimated in the hundreds of millions, but it now rarely tops 60 million. Last winter, the estimate was roughly 38 million. The much smaller West Coast monarch population is even more vulnerable. Last winter, fewer than 10,000 were seen huddling in their usual spots along the California coast.\n\nExperts cite a host of reasons for the decline, all related to human influence.\n\nIn the fall and spring, heat and drought spurred by climate change have reduced the abundance of nectar plants along the migration routes. In the winter, deforestation, beetle infestations and climate shifts threaten the colonies. And in the summer, monarchs’ milkweed host plants have been virtually eliminated from Midwestern farm fields, once the insect’s most important breeding grounds, because of the adoption of herbicide-tolerant crops. Spring and summer are crucial because females need to lay hundreds of eggs each to make up for all the casualties in fall and winter, when most monarchs are celibate.\n\nThe 36-employee company that built the trackers, Cellular Tracking Technologies, operates out of a hangar-like space at Cape May Airport in New Jersey. Key staff members have roots in conservation biology and make tracking devices suitable for animals ranging from bumblebees to elephant seals. (They’re working on tags for beavers and platypuses, too.)\n\n“This has been a 20-year journey for me, to create a company that I hoped one day could make major advances like this possible,” said Michael Lanzone, the founder and chief executive.\n\nField tests of the company’s newly enhanced insect tags began Sept. 12 in Long Point, Ontario, when two Canadian government researchers radio-tagged 30 monarchs. The next day, they checked the phone app and were shocked to see how well the monarchs were flying.\n\n“We could see they were just bombing it across Lake Erie and then making landfall in places like Cleveland,” said Greg Mitchell, a research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada.\n\nMore than nine weeks later, one of those monarchs — a female designated LPM021 — has flown far beyond the known colonies and was last detected 425 miles from Guatemala.\n\nSpurred by the success in Ontario, the company quickly gave away more than 400 tags to researchers across the Eastern United States and southern Canada. Soon, the maps on the company’s app were full of butterfly tracks, and dozens of entomologists were speculating in a group chat about which monarch would make history by being the first tracked all the way to the isolated Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve west of Mexico City.\n\nIn the end, it was JMU004 that won the metaphorical gold medal in a photo finish. Tagged by Leone Brown of James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., he was detected 37 days later in the El Rosario colony, on Nov. 9 at 10:35 a.m. local time, just three hours ahead of a monarch tagged at Monarch Watch headquarters in Lawrence, Kan.\n\nA disappointed but sporting Dr. Taylor broke the news on the scientists’ group chat, while Dr. Brown got to share JMU004’s triumph with her butterfly-loving 7-year-old daughter.\n\nWhile the entomologists joked about the “race,” they emphasize that the real point is to see where all the radio-tagged monarchs are going, and how they get there. “It’s not about winners and losers,” Dr. Brown said. “It’s about staying in the game.”\n\nThe unorthodox paths some tagged monarchs are taking suggest they may be affected by the extra weight. But Dr. Brown, who has studied the question, thinks the impact is minimal.\n\n“Most of them are acclimating to the tags, even if they might be moving a little slower or need a little more time,” she said.\n\nA crucial engineering feat led to the tracking breakthrough. Earlier this year, Cellular Tracking Technologies modified its butterfly tag, which it calls BlūMorpho, in a way that allows its signals to be automatically detected by billions of Bluetooth-enabled devices, as long as a tagged butterfly passes within about 300 feet.\n\nIts other tags are sold almost exclusively to biologists for research projects, but the company hopes BlūMorphos will also appeal to amateurs willing to pay the $200 retail price, including thousands who raise and release monarchs themselves.\n\nUnlike bird tracking, which requires a special permit, there are no nationwide restrictions on attaching trackers to insects, although California and several other states require permits.\n\nStill, it’s not clear that Blū tagging will be a simple process for casual users, who may end up damaging some of the butterflies.\n\nFor every monarch Dr. Brown radio-tags, she slips glassine paper envelopes over the wings to protect the scales and uses small weights to keep them from fluttering. She then brushes eyelash adhesive on its thorax and delicately applies a BlūMorpho tag, a tiny black device with a trailing antenna that isn’t much longer than the monarch’s own natural antennae.\n\n“I don’t think these tags should be used willy-nilly — they should be used for conservation and focused research,” Dr. Brown said. “But a lot of people love monarchs, so I guess they will do what they want to do.”\n\nDan Fagin is a science journalism professor at New York University, where he directs the Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program.

French officials have suggested Russia was behind pigs’ heads placed near mosques in the Paris area, in an attempt to cause unrest.\n\nMs. Caroit said the incident was amplified on social media by foreign powers.\n\n“It was done purposely so that people would react and think that it was some sort of Islamic attack, or some sort of anti-Muslim attack,” she said. “So there really is a manipulation of fact.”\n\nMs. Caroit, who visited the United Nations last week for talks on this issue and others, acknowledged the newly divergent French and U.S. approaches. But she insisted that allies could disagree, and where America was taking things apart on this issue, France would invest in new defenses.\n\n“With your friends and allies, you’re able to say where you disagree or take a different approach,” she said. “Climate is one of them, gender is another. Perhaps the importance of fighting disinformation is another. We’re not judging or commenting on it, but we just have a slightly different approach.”\n\nStill, the French government faces the same debates over foreign malign influence that have taken place in the United States. French far-right parties, including Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, have echoed the arguments of Republicans in the United States that efforts to call out foreign propaganda are really efforts to silence populist or conservative voices. (Ms. Le Pen has been a longstanding critic of France’s 2018 “fake news” law, arguing it was repressive and led to indirect censorship.)\n\nFrench officials have argued that they are not suppressing any speech and just want French citizens to understand the difference between fact and opinion and make sure the origin of information is clear.\n\n“We’re not preventing anyone from stating an opinion, but we just want to ensure that people know the source of the information that they’re getting,” Ms. Caroit said.\n\nIn a polarized world, the goal of arguing for common facts and diverging opinions seems increasingly difficult.\n\nWhile France banned the Kremlin-supported Russia Today and Sputnik news outlets, much of the country’s more recent efforts have been focused on media literacy and debunking narratives spread by Russia and other countries.\n\nThis fall, the French foreign ministry began a program, called “French Response,” in which the ministry and its diplomats more aggressively call out disinformation and foreign influence campaigns.\n\nEqually important, Ms. Caroit said, are efforts in elementary schools to help children become better at determining the origin of information, especially because most of them do not read traditional news sources.\n\n“Today, 70 percent of our youth are using social networks for their primary, if not only, source of information,” she said.\n\nMany of the foreign malign attacks France has fought have been from Russia, but multiple countries have tried to either sow dissent in France or influence the public debate. Defending the information space, Ms. Caroit said, is “at the very core of democracy.”\n\n“It has an impact on elections,” she said. “It has an impact on how citizens see their institutions, trust their representatives, and it is of the utmost importance in particular for younger generations.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/hbcus-mackenzie-scott-donations.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:25:59-05:00","title":"MacKenzie Scott Gives $700 Million to Historically Black Colleges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated over $700 million to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), marking one of the largest private philanthropic campaigns in U.S. education history.

Million to Historically Black Colleges\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T18:25:59-05:00\n\nPhilander Smith University, a historically Black college in Arkansas, received the largest gift in its 147-year history on Friday, when billionaire MacKenzie Scott gave $19 million.\n\nIt was one of 15 donations she gave to historically Black colleges and universities this year, adding up to more than $700 million, according to a list compiled by Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers and the executive director of the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions.\n\n“This gift is a resounding vote of confidence in our mission and our momentum,” Dr. Maurice D. Gipson, the president of Philander Smith, said in a statement.\n\nThe donations to the schools, some of which have struggled with enrollment and finances, come as the Trump administration has also directed additional money their way. In September, the administration allocated nearly $500 million for H.B.C.U.s and tribal colleges, on top of the federal funds they had already expected.\n\nRecipients of Ms. Scott’s windfall praised her for giving funds without strings attached, which they said would allow institutions to distribute funds however they see fit.\n\nMichael Lomax, the president and chief executive of the United Negro College Fund, which received $70 million from Ms. Scott to be shared with 37 H.B.C.U.s, described the donations as a “sea change in American philanthropy.”\n\nDr. Lomax said historically Black colleges have been doing “more with less for over a century.” More than 70 percent of their students are eligible for Pell grants, which are meant for students who come from low-income families, he added.\n\nOn Friday, Ms. Scott, the former wife of the tech billionaire Jeff Bezos, also gave $63 million to Prairie View A&M University in Texas and $50 million to Bowie State University in Maryland.\n\nHoward University, a prominent historically Black institution and a major research center in Washington, received the largest single gift from Ms. Scott among H.B.C.U.s this year, at $80 million in early November. Of that, $17 million was earmarked for its medical school, the oldest training center for Black physicians in the nation.\n\n“It’s a very transformative gift in more ways than one,” Wayne A. I. Frederick, the president of Howard University, said in an interview. The latest donation from Ms. Scott was one of the largest the university has received, he said, and the third from the philanthropist in the last five years. In all, her gifts to Howard have totaled more than $130 million.\n\n“Placing that trust and that opportunity in our hands to do what we may consider highest priority is so critical, and especially in a shifting landscape,” he said.\n\nMs. Scott, who has pledged to give a majority of her wealth back to society, said she and her team use data to identify organizations for funds, “with special attention to those operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates and low access to philanthropic capital.”\n\nPresident Trump has also shown support for historically Black institutions. In his first term, he distributed $250 million in annual funding and cut more than $300 million in federal loans for the schools. In April, through an executive order, he unveiled a new White House job to oversee H.B.C.U.s. But the position currently remains vacant.\n\nDr. Gasman, the Rutgers professor, said the Trump administration has sent mixed signals. The president has sought to crack down on diversity programs in education and has complained about the teaching of Black history. The funds for H.B.C.U.s and tribal colleges were announced as the federal government cut programs that support minority students in science and engineering programs and schools with significant Hispanic enrollment.\n\n“They are willing to support Black people in Black institutions, but they are not very comfortable with Black people in white institutions,” Dr. Gasman said.\n\nHere are the schools that received donations from Ms. Scott, according to Dr. Gasman’s list:\n\nAlabama State University: $38 million\n\nAlcorn State University: $42 million\n\nBowie State University: $50 million\n\nClark Atlanta University: $38 million\n\nHoward University: $80 million\n\nMorgan State University: $63 million\n\nNorfolk State University: $50 million\n\nNorth Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University: $63 million\n\nPrairie View A&M State University: $63 million\n\nSpelman College: $38 million\n\nUniversity of Maryland Eastern Shore: $38 million\n\nVirginia State University: $50 million\n\nVoorhees University: $19 million\n\nWinston-Salem State University: $50 million\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/briefing/the-un-security-council-backs-trumps-gaza-plan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:09:10-05:00","title":"The U.N.

Security Council Backs Trump’s Gaza Plan\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T18:09:10-05:00\n\nPresident Trump’s peace plan for Gaza was enshrined in international law today when the United Nations Security Council voted today to approve a U.S. resolution. Thirteen countries backed the American plan. Russia and China had raised objections but chose to abstain instead of vetoing it, apparently swayed by support from several Arab and Muslim nations.\n\nThe vote — a major diplomatic victory for the Trump administration — offered international support for Trump’s 20-point plan to move past a cease-fire and rebuild Gaza. The U.S. resolution called for an International Stabilization Force to enter, demilitarize and govern Gaza.\n\nIt also envisions a “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza at least until the end of 2027 and says that the enclave would be managed day-to-day by a “technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip.” Trump said this evening that he would lead the board and that the other members would be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nDavid Richardson, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, resigned today after six months on the job. The next leader of FEMA, Karen Evans, lacks experience in emergency management, which is a legal requirement to lead the agency.\n\nThe moves highlighted a fact that has worried FEMA employees for months: The agency’s future is unclear. Trump suggested earlier this year that he wanted to eliminate the agency, and Richardson’s predecessor was pushed out a day after arguing that FEMA was vital. More recently, the president has indicated that he wants the agency to be overhauled to shift more responsibility for disaster response to the states.\n\nAlready, about a third of FEMA’s work force — roughly 2,000 employees — have left since Trump took office. And Evans, who is set to take over the agency on Dec. 1, has played a central role in the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs there. In the coming weeks, the administration is expected to release a report on its plans for FEMA.\n\nFor more: The deadly July 4 floods in Texas were the biggest test of the agency during Richardson’s tenure. New videos, data and reporting offer the most detailed account of what happened.\n\nThe Trump administration announced a plan to significantly restrict the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to limit pollution in wetlands, rivers and other bodies of water. The proposal would strip protections from bodies of water that are not “relatively permanent,” potentially affecting as much as 85 percent of wetlands nationwide.\n\nIn other Trump administration news:\n\nAfter campaigning to block such a move, Trump reversed course and urged House Republicans to vote to release files about the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nA day before Saudi Arabia’s crown prince is set to meet with Trump at the White House, the president said he would sell advanced F-35 fighter jets to the kingdom.\n\nA judge said the case against James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, could be in serious trouble because of apparent misconduct by the inexperienced prosecutor handpicked by Trump.\n\nThe Times interviewed 60 attorneys to learn how the Justice Department has unraveled under Trump.\n\nThe administration escalated its pressure campaign against Venezuela, though Trump left open the possibility of negotiations.\n\nFor the first time, scientists were able to actively follow individual monarch butterflies on their astonishing annual migration from the U.S. and Canada down to their winter colonies in Mexico. The journeys stretched thousands of miles, showcasing monarchs’ impressive navigational and flying abilities.\n\nThe researchers were able to track the butterflies thanks to a tiny new solar-powered radio tag that weighs just 60 milligrams. It could provide crucial insights into the poorly understood life cycles of butterflies, bees and other flying insects.\n\nA.I.: Jeff Bezos launched an artificial intelligence start-up called Project Prometheus, for which he will serve as co-chief executive, with $6.2 billion in funding.\n\nTech: E.U. lawmakers are moving to scale back and simplify the bloc’s aggressive, landmark rules for artificial intelligence and data privacy.\n\nEurope: Ukraine is running low on cash. If an E.U. plan to use frozen Russian assets falls through, there’s not a good Plan B.\n\nTrade: The U.S. accused 13 Italian pasta makers of selling their products at artificially low prices and threatened them with tariffs of over 90 percent.\n\nHeist: One of the men accused of stealing jewels from the Louvre was once a star of the city’s urban dirt bike subculture.\n\nNew York: A teenage girl told an officer that her adoptive father had been raping her. The officer didn’t believe her, and the abuse continued.\n\nCryptocurrency: Illicit funds have flowed onto crypto exchanges, scammers have used crypto A.T.M.s to manipulate victims and big traders have been targeted for kidnapping.\n\nSports: Two weeks ago, Marshawn Kneeland scored his first N.F.L. touchdown. Two days later, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a police chase.\n\nArt: The Costume Institute, relegated to the Met’s basement except for its annual blockbuster exhibition, will get a new ground-floor gallery that will pair artworks with fashion.\n\nAfter years of declining sales and increasing costs, art sellers insist that things are finally turning around.

With Easter approaching, some longtime Italian American residents were bristling at what they saw as preferential treatment.\n\nA Facebook post by Nick Mattiello, 30, a former volunteer firefighter, gained traction in a local town group, crystallizing the frustration. Mr. Mattiello cited “a noticeable absence of displays honoring Christianity” despite representation for other faiths. He called for an Easter display in the spot where the Ramadan crescent had hung.\n\n“We acknowledge other religions but continuously overlook the foundational one that reveres Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior,” he wrote. “It’s disappointing and disheartening to me.”\n\nWhat might have become an explosive situation was quickly defused when Mayor Michael Gonnelli learned of the complaint. He asked a public works employee to build a cross, which went up after Ramadan ended, right in time for Easter. Crisis averted.\n\nSuch conflicts have become more common in Secaucus. When Mr. Gonnelli first became mayor in 2009, the town resembled him: white and Italian American. But in the intervening years, Secaucus, five miles west of Manhattan in New Jersey’s Meadowlands, has experienced a transformation.\n\nWhite residents are now a minority in a diverse community where Indian, Asian and Latino populations have grown substantially. Though the town has traditionally leaned Democratic, Vice President Kamala Harris beat Mr. Trump by just 70 votes in last year’s election.\n\nMr. Gonnelli grew up in Secaucus, and he used to fish and hunt pheasants in the marshland behind his home before a hospital and a housing development were built there. He and his wife, Linda, raised three children in the town.\n\nMr. Gonnelli held several municipal positions — fire chief, public works superintendent, councilman — before being pressed into service as mayor after his predecessor went to prison for corruption. After 16 years in office, Mr. Gonnelli still seems to be widely admired; he has run unopposed as an independent in four of his five terms, including this past November.\n\nBut as Mr. Gonnelli enters what may be his final term at age 70, some residents wonder how Secaucus will navigate cultural change without his charismatic and notably inclusive governance.\n\n“This town used to be heavily Italian,” the mayor said before the election. “Now it’s everyone, which makes it so much better. Even in my office, I have Indians, Egyptians, Puerto Ricans, you name it.”\n\nIncorporated as a pig-farming town in the early 1900s, Secaucus for decades was synonymous with Italian American life: neighborhood delis, Catholic churches and backdrops for “The Sopranos.”\n\nToday, its transformation is visible everywhere: a Gandhi statue greets visitors at the town recreation center; the big-box chain HomeGoods sells Diwali decorations; and an Indian grocery opened last year. Even Natoli’s, the town’s oldest Italian deli, has added vegetarian options to accommodate observant Hindus.\n\nThrough it all, Mr. Gonnelli has never strayed from a kind of small-town politics. His familiar white Jeep is stuffed with children’s toys that he passes out as freely as he shares his cellphone number. Residents have countless examples of Mr. Gonnelli’s responding to the most mundane requests.\n\nDawn Grassano, a local nurse, choked up recalling a time of financial stress when her son’s sneakers fell apart at school. She hadn’t told anyone, she said, but Mr. Gonnelli showed up the next morning with a new pair of Nikes for the boy.\n\nOn a typical Friday in September, Mr. Gonnelli was in his office, working the phones. He found a couch for someone who had recently moved to town, rounded up tables for a church fair and called an older woman, at her daughter’s request, and urged her to go to the hospital.\n\nVisitors cycled through his office all morning. Mr. Gonnelli welcomed a data-center developer — the kind of commercial project he actively courts to keep property taxes down — and urged him to plant trees around town. He met a woman who said she was at the brink of homelessness, and he called around until he found her an apartment without move-in fees.\n\nThe mayor spent the afternoon making daily rounds in his Jeep. His first stop was a town-run thrift shop stocked floor to ceiling with boxes of donated clothes and other supplies, free for needy Secaucus residents. Next was a brief visit to the senior center and then on to the town’s Tot Center, where he handed out stuffed toys to a room full of toddlers. People stopped him constantly to chat, vent or ask for help.\n\nTo Jayesh Patel, who immigrated to the United States from India as a child in 1980 and runs a local day-care business, the mayor’s responsiveness is impressive. “I can ask him any question and he’ll get me an answer,” he said. “I mean, the guy’s on Facebook, for God’s sake, responding to messages nonstop. I worry about his stress levels.”\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Gonnelli has increasingly spent his time brokering relations between different cultural groups. When the Indian grocery opened, he heard complaints from a number of longtime residents.\n\n“It’s a grocery store,” he recalled telling them. “You can shop there, too.” Privately, he said, he also encouraged the store owner to consider adding a deli section, suggesting that doing so would appeal to Italian American shoppers.\n\nHe sees his role as accommodating a range of requests: for space to gather, permits for events, equipment donations. “I say yes to everyone,” he said, “as long as I can say yes.”\n\nBut he is not blind to the increased friction around immigration and the national political climate, which he calls “a complete mess.”\n\nEarlier this year, after he showed support for the construction of a mosque across from Town Hall, white and Indian residents expressed concerns to him privately, he said, ostensibly about increased traffic. Mr. Gonnelli’s typical response, he said, is to point out that Secaucus already has multiple churches and a temple, and that the Muslim community does a lot for the town.\n\nHis reassurances haven’t eliminated unease. On a recent Facebook thread in a town group, one commenter avoided subtlety: “I looked at the demographics and I’d rather not live around Indian and Muslim immigrants.”\n\nSteve Natoli, 68, whose namesake deli has served as Secaucus’s unofficial town hall for decades, sees national polarization playing out in his customers’ daily conversations. Some residents fear “a mass exodus of Americans,” he said — the same worries he has witnessed through Hudson County’s waves of Polish, German, Irish, Italian and Hispanic immigration. “When the Italians came into Hoboken, everybody was like, ‘Oh, my God, the Mafia is coming,’” Mr. Natoli said. “That’s not how it works.”\n\nBut he conceded that this time seemed different. Mr. Natoli feels that normal tensions have been supercharged by an American political culture that has abandoned the civility of “old souls,” politicians like Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill — or Mr. Gonnelli. A framed photo in Mr. Natoli’s deli honors the “3 o’clock club”: retired friends who gathered daily to argue about politics over sandwiches and coffee, a ritual he now finds hard to imagine.\n\nThese days, the town’s different communities often live in parallel. Last month, Secaucus’s main square, Buchmuller Park, was the site of a vigil for the conservative commentator Charlie Kirk on a Tuesday and a Diwali festival on the weekend. There was virtually no overlap in attendees.\n\nThe vigil for Mr. Kirk was organized by Mr. Mattiello, who had led the push for an Easter cross in the town square. Around 150 people attended, mostly wearing red, with some in MAGA gear. The mayor chose not to attend, although he approved the event and waived permits and fees.\n\nDays later, as many as 500 people, mostly South Asian, filled the park to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. Mr. Gonnelli made an appearance, wearing a white Nehru jacket with pastel accents. Earlier in the day, he had joined a separate Diwali ceremony at the Hindu temple, where trays of Indian food and sweets shared a table with a six-foot Italian hero (vegetarian) and several pizzas. The bagpipers wore turbans, not kilts.\n\nEven a mayor with five landslide victories has his detractors. “I’m sure there’s people that don’t like me, believe me,” Mr. Gonnelli said. “There’s got to be people out there who hate my guts. But I don’t really know who they are.” Then one came to mind — someone the mayor said opposes just about everything he stands for. After a pause, he added, “He’s just that kind of guy.”\n\nMr. Gonnelli sees Secaucus’s evolution as part of a shift toward a more multicultural America, in both its populace and leadership. Just across the Hudson, New York City recently elected its first South Asian mayor, Zohran Mamdani, whom Mr. Gonnelli said he hoped to meet one day.\n\nHe said the next mayor of Secaucus may well be Indian, although he added that it could be someone “Italian, Asian, Norwegian — no one can predict.” He would be happy to pass on his formula for harmony: Say yes to everyone, broker peace where possible, trust the strength of small-town ties. “Me, personally?” he added, “All I want is the best for Secaucus — somebody who gets along with everyone.”\n\nMark Bonamo contributed reporting.\n\n"}]}
