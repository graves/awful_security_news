President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser  John Bolton  could face more charges, Justice Department prosecutors suggested at a Friday court hearing in his criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department continues to go through the large amount of documents recovered in the case, including from Bolton’s home in Maryland and his office in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  The material, which prosecutors say includes classified information they accuse Bolton of illegally sharing with others during his time in Trump’s first term, must be reviewed by the intelligence community before Bolton’s defense team can have access to it.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, declined to comment on prosecutor’s suggestion that additional charges could come.\n \n\n   \n  Because of this extended process for discovery, no trial has been set in the case and the review alone is expected to last until at least May.\n \n\n   \n  Coming into the hearing, prosecutors and Bolton’s team proposed that all discovery would be produced by late May, but US District Judge Theodore Chuang on Friday appeared frustrated with that plan and ordered prosecutors to speed up production of the documents at the center of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m still having trouble with why we need seven months for this,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Chuang, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, at one point scolded prosecutors for what he viewed as their failure to complete some of the time-intensive work that needs to be done with the US intelligence community in cases involving classified materials.\n \n\n   \n  “If you actually wanted to indict, you’d want to know what the intelligence community actually needs with these,” the judge said at one point.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors pointed to several issues they say have been slowing down their work, including the involvement of a “filter team” to help figure out which material may involve attorney-client privilege.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas Sullivan, the lead prosecutor in the case, told the judge that there was a “voluminous” amount of documents in the case that needed to be sifted through by both his team, the intelligence community and that separate “filter team.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a process that takes time,” Sullivan said. “I can assure the court that we are working with them to review these documents as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Bolton pleaded not guilty last month to eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article

The incident also exposed tensions between national networks like ABC and local affiliates, such as Nexstar and Sinclair, who previously blacked out Kimmel’s show due to FCC chair Brendan Carr’s criticism of his comments on Charlie Kirk’s suspected killer. The FCC has since announced a review of network-affiliate relationships, signaling growing institutional concern over media independence and political influence.","keyTakeAways":["Trump has repeatedly

21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can  sign up for free here . \n \n\n   \n  “Every five weeks,” Jimmy Kimmel observed, President Trump “flips out and wants me fired.”\n \n\n   \n  It happened again this week, when the president posted on Truth Social, asking why ABC keeps “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on the air.\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel responded on Thursday night’s show, pointing out that Trump’s post came at 12:49 a.m., “11 minutes after the show ended on the East Coast.”\n \n\n   \n  He said directly to Trump, “Thanks for watching us on TV instead of on YouTube. We appreciate that. And I’ll tell you, it’s viewers like you who keep us on the air, ironically.”\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel, whose contract with ABC is coming due in May, then said, “Mr. President, I admire your tenacity. If you’re watching tonight, which I presume you are, how about this: I’ll go when you go, OK? We’ll be a team. Let’s ride off into the sunset together like Butch Cassidy and the Suntan Kid. And until then, if I may borrow a phrase from you: ‘Quiet, piggy.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s “piggy” remark to a Bloomberg reporter last week garnered widespread outrage this week, as did his insulting comments to ABC News correspondent Mary Bruce on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  One of Bruce’s questions about the government’s Jeffrey Epstein files prompted Trump to criticize her tone, bash ABC as a “crappy company,” and encourage the FCC to revoke the network’s licenses.\n \n\n   \n  Bruce was praised by fellow members of the White House press corps for asking important questions despite the president’s demeaning comments.\n \n\n   \n  After the tense Oval Office exchange, the White House generated a list of grievances against ABC and claimed the news division had decided to “wage war” against Trump and his voters.\n \n\n   \n  ABC and its parent company, Disney, declined to comment, choosing to let the news division’s work speak for itself.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday’s “Good Morning America,” co-host Robin Roberts referenced these “extremely challenging times” and thanked Bruce for “your willingness to ask these types of questions” to those in power.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s latest blast against Kimmel came Wednesday night, shortly after Kimmel talked on air about Trump reversing course and signing the bill compelling the Justice Department to release Epstein materials.\n \n\n   \n  “We are one step closer to answering the question, what did the president know and how old were these women when he knew it,” Kimmel quipped.\n \n\n   \n  Trump wrote that Kimmel has “NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS” and asked, “Why do the TV Syndicates put up with it? Also, totally biased coverage. Get the bum off the air!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel’s ratings are better than Trump thinks, but that’s beside the point. The point is that Trump wants to drive a wedge between Kimmel and local stations, which he called “syndicates.”\n \n\n   \n  Two big owners of ABC-affiliated stations, Nexstar and Sinclair, need Trump’s man in charge of regulating stations, FCC chair Brendan Carr, to approve pending deals.\n \n\n   \n  Both Nexstar and Sinclair yanked Kimmel’s show back in September when Carr denounced Kimmel’s remarks about Charlie Kirk’s suspected killer. The highly unusual blackout spotlighted longstanding tensions between local affiliates and national networks — as well as the affiliates’ limited power.\n \n\n   \n  ABC briefly suspended Kimmel’s show nationwide, but brought it back in a matter of days, leaving Nexstar and Sinclair  little choice  but to resume airing it.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week Carr announced that the FCC will review the relationships between networks and affiliates, though his agency has little power to effect change.\n \n\n   \n  As for Kimmel, he made it sound like he’s grown accustomed to Trump’s angry posts.\n \n\n   \n  “I woke up this morning, I’m in bed, my wife comes out of the bathroom, she’s got her phone,” Kimmel said. “She goes, ‘Um, Trump tweeted you should be fired again.’ I was like, ‘Oh.’ And then I went downstairs and made bagels for the kids.”\n \n\n   \n  He also remarked that “if you got this many threats from a neighbor, you’d have no problem getting a restraining order. The judge would be like, ‘Yeah, sounds like the guy’s nuts.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also recently took out his anger on another late-night comic, NBC’s Seth Meyers; last Saturday Trump said Meyers has “an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome” and “NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!”\n \n\n   \n  Carr reposted Trump’s message on X without any further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meyers brought up Trump’s grievance on Monday’s edition of “Late Night,” remarking that “being attacked by the president this weekend doesn’t make me special in any way, shape or form. I was simply on the same shit list as Christopher Wray, James Comey, Indiana Republicans, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former President Joe Biden.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/ukraine-war-trump-plan-zelensky-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00-05:00","title":"Trump gives Ukraine days to accept his plan to end war as Zelensky warns of ‘difficult moment in history’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Thursday, November 20, 2025, for Ukraine to accept a 28-point peace plan that includes significant concessions to Russia—such as recognizing Russian control over Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk, limiting Ukraine’s military to 600,000 personnel, and banning NATO membership—drawing sharp opposition from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who warns of a 'difficult moment in history' and insists Ukraine will not betray its sovereignty.

war as Zelensky warns of ‘difficult moment in history’ \n       \n  By Svitlana Vlasova, Catherine Nicholls and Kara Fox, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his plan – widely seen as favoring Russia – to end the war, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country faced “one of the most difficult moments” in its history.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines. But Thursday is it,” the president said in a radio interview with Fox News. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Addressing the nation via video on Friday﻿, Zelensky said the US plan for ending the war would mean his country losing its dignity or a key ally.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan put forward by Trump  puts pressure  on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin told a security council briefing late Friday that he had received the US-proposed plan for Ukraine and that he believes it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian president said he was ready to “show the flexibility” that was agreed upon during the  summit  with Trump in Alaska this August, but added that Russia had not “substantively” discussed the deal with the US.\n \n\n   \n  In his video address, Zelensky said, “The pressure on Ukraine is now at its most intense. Ukraine may now face a very difficult choice: either the loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner, or 28 difficult points, or an extremely harsh winter.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine would “work calmly” and quickly with the US and its partners towards an end to the war, Zelensky said. Zelensky spoke with US Vice President JD Vance on Friday about the plan.\n \n\n   \n  A number of European leaders have spoken out in support of Ukraine since the details of Trump’s proposal were released, vowing to stand by Kyiv and insisting that no decisions should be made about the fate of the country without its input.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the EU appears to have been left largely out in the cold, though German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he and Trump discussed the US plan in a phone call Friday. “We have agreed on the next steps at the advisers’ level. I will now brief the European partners,” Merz said on X.\n \n\n   \n  In a joint call with Zelensky earlier Friday, Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer “agreed to continue to pursue the goal of safeguarding vital European and Ukrainian interests in the long term,” according to the German government.\n \n\n   \n  This includes “ensuring that the line of contact is the starting point for an understanding and that the Ukrainian armed forces remain capable of effectively defending Ukraine’s sovereignty,” it said in a statement, differing from the US proposal which calls for Ukraine to withdraw from some of its own territory.\n \n\n   \n   European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a  post on X  that “there should be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,” adding that European leaders would meet on Saturday on the margins of the G20 summit in Johannesburg to discuss the proposal.\n \n\n   \n    Zelensky: I will not betray Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears to be giving Russia  almost everything it wants , with much of the text resembling the maximalist positions Moscow held during talks in Istanbul in 2022, shortly after the invasion and when its forces held more of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Like the proposal the Trump administration crafted which led to the  ceasefire in Gaza , the Ukraine  plan  reads as bullet-pointed list, laying out commitments each side would make in order to drive a lasting end to the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukraine plan – which has been seen by CNN – calls for a halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by the US president. The draft plan’s veracity was confirmed by a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the ideas put forward in the 28-point plan have been rejected in previous negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  The plan would have Russia-occupied Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States,” a previous red line for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of eastern Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.”\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel and calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days – something that would be extremely challenging to organize.\n \n\n   \n  It also outlines a return of Russia into the global economy, including the lifting of sanctions and an invitation to rejoin the G8.\n \n\n   \n  In the Fox News interview on Friday, Trump said that Putin is “not looking for more war” and is “taking punishment,” despite the plan appearing to offer major concessions to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said that he would work around the clock to find a path forward on the plan, while saying he would not betray his country.\n \n\n   \n  “I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will offer alternatives, but we will definitely not give the enemy any reason to say that Ukraine does not want peace, that it is disrupting the process, and that Ukraine is not ready for diplomacy,” Zelensky continued.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.

      \nUpdated: \n        1:51 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday is turning into Redemption Day on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow gained 800 points, or 1.7%, and the broader S&P 500 rose 1.6%. The Nasdaq was about 1.7% higher. The rally came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get  a December rate cut , after all.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December?\n \n\n   \n  At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting:\n \n\n   \n  Phew. Right?\n \n\n   \n  Wrong.\n \n\n   \n  Traders at first  cheered Thursday morning , sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday.\n \n\n   \n  Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions.\n \n\n   \n  “People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital.\n \n\n   \n  By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  Markets rebounded sharply Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat.  Bitcoin  sank another 1% Friday morning, slipping to around $85,000 – its lowest level since April – and still on pace for its worst month since 2022.\n \n\n   \n    So, what’s next?\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all.\n \n\n   \n  Investors also looked more closely at a  particularly confusing jobs report  and realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull.\n \n\n   \n  Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all.\n \n\n   \n  So here we are on Friday, right back where we started.

And is Mamdani proving to be the boogeyman Republicans hope he’ll be?\n \n\n   \n  We’ve got some new national polling conducted after the self-described democratic socialist’s win earlier this month. And it offers some clues.\n \n\n   \n  In sum: Mamdani isn’t particularly unpopular, especially relative to plenty of other big-name US politicians. But he does clearly animate Republicans and older Americans against him — a lot more than he animates Democrats and young people for him.\n \n\n   \n  And that reinforces the potential utility for the GOP of making him a main character nationally.\n \n\n   \n  A  Marquette University Law School poll  this week showed Americans viewed Mamdani unfavorably by a 38%-29% margin, while a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  released last week showed they disliked him 36%-33%.\n \n\n   \n  These are negative numbers, but they’re not exactly “pariah” numbers. In fact, these surveys show Mamdani’s splits are better than some of the most well-known American politicians.\n \n\n   \n  Those include Trump (17-19 points underwater), Vice President JD Vance (14-16 points underwater) and Kamala Harris (minus-19 in the Marquette poll).\n \n\n   \n  Even when it comes to the political middle, the democratic socialist appears to be in relatively decent territory — at least at this early juncture. (He doesn’t take office until January 1.)\n \n\n   \n  While independents disliked him 35%-25% in the Marquette poll, those numbers were actually significantly better than Trump’s (70%-29% unfavorable), Vance’s (60-25%), Harris’s (55%-38%) and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s (54%-32%).\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most strikingly, the Reuters poll actually showed Mamdani’s favorable rating among independents (30%) was actually slightly higher than Trump’s (26%) and similar to Vance’s (28%) — even though Mamdani is far less well-known. (33% of independents viewed him negatively.)\n \n\n   \n  The numbers seem to reinforce something we’ve seen with other prominent democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And that’s that Americans don’t write them off just because of the s-word. (In fact, a July Gallup poll showed Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were actually the  two most popular US politicians among 10 figures  tested.)\n \n\n   \n  Americans seem open to democratic socialists, as long as they are appealing on a personal level and focus on what they think are the right things.\n \n\n   \n  And for Mamdani, that’s  all about affordability . Even the White House has given Mamdani props for that, suggesting it helped him overcome efforts to label him an extremist.\n \n\n   \n  “Why did Zohran Mamdani do so well last night? He relentlessly focused on affordability,” White House political adviser James Blair  told Politico  the day after the election. “People talk about communists, they can say all these things, but the fact is he was talking about the cost of living.”\n \n\n   \n  And there seems to be something to that. In fact, polls have suggested Americans are actually  in favor of some of Mamdani’s more socialistic ideas , including rent freezing, free public buses and even the much-maligned (on the right) government-owned grocery stores.\n \n\n   \n  You could be forgiven for thinking people just want to see politicians  doing something  about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump’s lack of focus on those issues seems to be costing him dearly, with the Marquette poll showing Americans disapproved of him on the “cost of living” by a massive 72%-28% margin. Even 4 in 10 Republicans disapproved of him on that issue.\n \n\n   \n  All of this being said, it’s clear Mamdani can be politically useful for Republicans. That’s because he negatively polarizes some key groups.\n \n\n   \n  In both polls, strong views of Mamdani tilted more negative — by about a 2-to-1 margin in. That suggests the passion was very much on the “anti” side — and that he mobilizes the opposition.\n \n\n   \n  In the Marquette poll, for instance, 56% of Republicans viewed Mamdani “very unfavorably,” compared to just 30% of Democrats who viewed him “very favorably.”\n \n\n   \n  About three-quarters of Republicans who knew Mamdani well enough to rate him felt very negatively toward him. But less than half of Democrats who knew Mamdani that well rated him very positively.\n \n\n   \n  This negative polarization is also particularly strong among older voters. Four times as many Americans aged 60 or older viewed Mamdani very negatively as very positively, according to the Marquette poll. It was about a 3-to-1 margin among Americans aged 45 through 59.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, you could certainly understand why Republicans want to elevate Mamdani. But using him as a foil doesn’t seem like a silver bullet right now, especially as he seems to have tapped into an issue Trump has struggled with.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/marimar-martinez-shooting-case-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00Z","title":"Text messages and a moved SUV: How the government’s case against a Chicago woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apart","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marimar Martinez, a U.S. citizen and teaching assistant, was charged with assaulting a Customs and Border Protection agent during protests against immigration crackdowns in Chicago in October 2025.

agent fell apart \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Omar Jimenez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:06 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Even with a federal indictment hanging over her, claiming she had been a threat to law enforcement, Marimar Martinez was confident she could eventually prove her innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the truth,” Martinez told CNN’s Omar Jimenez Friday in an exclusive interview. “I know what really happened that day.”\n \n\n   \n  After an  extraordinary reversal by federal prosecutors  in one of the most high-profile cases connected to  Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago , a judge dismissed charges Thursday against Martinez, a United States citizen who was accused of ramming the vehicle of a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago before he shot her several times.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling from US District Judge Georgia Alexakis came after she repeatedly raised concerns about the handling of the investigation, including the revelation the vehicle of the Border Patrol agent who shot Martinez was moved  1,000 miles away  after the incident and text messages showing the agent  apparently bragging  about the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been  accused  of “aggressively and erratically” pursuing CBP agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city. The charging complaint says Exum then stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez – shots the Department of Homeland Security called “defensive.” Martinez had pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the courtroom, the judge noted the government’s case included omissions  that caused her to tread carefully  as Martinez’s defense attorney alleged it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Outside the courtroom, the high-profile case garnered public scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Christopher Parente – himself a former federal prosecutor – believes a rush by the Trump administration to have a meme-ready example of dangerous protest activity forced the US Attorney’s Office to push a weak case too far.\n \n\n   \n  “She never would have been charged under the old system because they would have found out right away that this case is garbage,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s decision came hours after federal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charges against both Martinez and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz.\n \n\n   \n  The US Attorney’s Office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz,” spokesperson Joseph Fitzpatrick said.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts told CNN the move was likely the result of a series of questionable claims from the federal government in court and a calculation over whether it can be proven at trial that the gunshots were justified.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers’ narratives,” CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the investigation and how experts say the government’s case fell apart:\n \n\n   \n    Apparent bragging text messages provide insight\n \n\n   \n  Text messages displayed in court earlier this month were likely key in the prosecution’s decision to move to dismiss charges, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Exum appeared to brag to fellow agents about his marksmanship after he repeatedly shot Martinez following a collision between their vehicles, the messages revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Boasting about the shots would look bad to a jury, Jackson said. Had the case moved forward, the government would have needed to justify every shot he took and prove there was immediate danger and proportionate force.\n \n\n   \n  Exum sent an  article from The Guardian  on October 7 to a group of other agents, which quoted Parente saying Martinez had “seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum said in the next text.\n \n\n   \n  Parente pointed to the messages as an indication Exum understood the high public scrutiny of the case.\n \n\n   \n  When Parente pressed him in court on what he meant, Exum responded he was a firearms instructor. He said, “I take pride in my shooting skills.”\n \n\n   \n  Another message to the group read, “I have a MOF amendment to add to my story. I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge MOF is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one up someone wherever possible. It’s unclear what exactly he was responding to because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Parente told CNN he believes most federal agents would be embarrassed to see that kind of bragging about a shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I have never come across an agent like that,” Parente said. “Those people go to work, and they try to do the right thing. They do not want to shoot people ever.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the texts “reflect poorly on the agent,” who would be a key witness at trial. Prosecutors also have to consider the fairness of the case. “Here you have a woman who was shot multiple times, and there were serious questions of whether she had done anything wrong whatsoever,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  If the case had moved forward, it likely   would have been unsuccessful, Jackson said. Martinez’s attorney agrees.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no way we were going to lose this trial on the evidence,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Key evidence was moved 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  Hearings in the case included discussion on what the government did with Exum’s car following the collision. The way that piece of key evidence was handled was one of the significant problems with the government’s case, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s defense attorney sought to prove his claim  the government potentially destroyed evidence  when it released Exum’s damaged vehicle and allowed the agent to drive it more than 1,000 miles to his home state of Maine, where the car may have had repairs.\n \n\n   \n  “That means that the government did not properly handle and maintain evidence. That’s a major problem in the presentation of the case,” Honig said. It needed to be preserved in the exact same condition it was in after the collision, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said it was a major misstep for the federal government that undermined their credibility. In every other case he’s seen where a car was involved in a shooting, the car is taken to be analyzed by law enforcement and experts reconstruct the collision.\n \n\n   \n  “Any evaluation of the trajectory of the damage would go to show what happened. Instead, you take the car away and destroy evidence,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Alexakis expressed skepticism over why Martinez’s car had been kept in Chicago as evidence while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally. “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n  But Alexakis said the government clearly believed the vehicle could be exculpatory evidence; otherwise, it would not have gone through the trouble to preserve records on the car.\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis ordered the government last month to return the SUV to Chicago.\n \n\n   \n    Judge questioned government’s narrative\n \n\n   \n  Of more than two dozen people arrested for impeding or assaulting federal officers or other protest-related offenses amid demonstrations over the federal immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, none have gone to trial and charges have been dropped against at least nine of them, The  Associated Press  reported. Judges have expressed skepticism over the strength of some cases.\n \n\n   \n  In its initial  press release , the Department of Homeland Security had referred to Martinez and her co-defendant as “domestic terrorists” who had “ambushed” the Border Patrol vehicle on Chicago streets. Martinez says she couldn’t believe the accusations she was facing.\n \n\n   \n  “They were (saying) ‘domestic terrorist,’ that she had a semi-automatic. I was just like, that’s crazy,” Martinez told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In court, Alexakis noted ﻿discrepancies in the government’s case have caused her “to question the narrative being put forward.”\n \n\n   \n  She pointed out the Justice Department had previously said in court the agent took the SUV back to Maine because it was his “personal vehicle,” then stated in a later court filing the car is part of an official Border Patrol fleet.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted she had not previously been told a mechanic had worked on the car, and the government has given at least two different accounts of who approved the car’s removal to Maine.\n \n\n   \n  She acknowledged the government version of events may turn out to be true, “but I can’t accept that possibility at this juncture,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There have been serious questions raised about the truthfulness of the statements made by the Border Patrol agent who shot Ms. Martinez and …about the extent to which she could get a fair trial when the Department of Homeland Security was using her case to make inflammatory public claims about the level of resistance to Operation Midway Blitz,” Northwestern law professor Paul Gowder told CNN. “Dismissing the case was the right thing to do with that kind of cloud over it.”\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Thursday restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the DOJ for further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, who works as a teaching assistant, says she now wants to put the case behind her and get back to work.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just so excited to go back with my students, the parents. They were so supportive,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez says she will be happy to get her normal life back.\n \n\n   \n  “People are like, ‘oh, you just want to be the victim,’” she said. “I’m not the victim. I’m actually a survivor from all of this injustice that’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/brian-walshe-guilty-plea-legal-defense","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Brian Walshe Pleads Guilty to Disposing of Wife’s Body; Murder Trial Proceeds with Strategic Shift","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, a Massachusetts man, pleaded guilty to misleading police and the illegal disposal of his wife Ana Walshe’s body, but denies murdering her.

Here’s what that could mean for his murder trial \n       \n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:51 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man on trial for murdering his wife in 2023 has admitted he disposed of her body in dumpsters and misled police, but his lawyers insist he is not admitting to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with the court having chosen the jury that will consider the murder charge still haunting him, the question becomes: How will  Brian Walshe’s  legal team defend him?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, minutes before jury selection was set to begin for his murder trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife, Ana Walshe. The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection was completed on Thursday.  CNN affiliate WCVB  reported 16 panelists had been chosen, 12 of whom will decide the case. The other four will be alternates.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The court has previously indicated that opening statements are slated to begin on December 1.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/12/19/health/holiday-health-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:03:00-05:00","title":"Want to boost your immune system during the holidays?

Make these 3 things habits \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:03 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The holiday season can be intense. People are traveling, hosting family and friends, and going to events — all the while keeping up other responsibilities of work and caregiving.\n \n\n   \n  All this activity has me thinking about the importance of keeping our immune systems healthy. What are some habits that everyone should adopt, such as getting good sleep, eating well and exercising regularly? Conversely, are there some habits people should consider stopping because of their negative impacts on the immune system?\n \n\n   \n  What about vaccines — is it too late to get vaccinated against respiratory viruses if you are going to family gatherings with newborns or older adults? And are there other safety tips people should keep in mind to reduce their chances of getting sick during the holidays?\n \n\n   \n  To help sort through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   Why it is especially important to keep our immune system healthy? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Our immune systems are our body’s natural defense against viruses, bacteria and other potential pathogens. Strong, healthy immune systems reduce the risk of contracting infectious diseases and falling seriously ill from them. The immune system is also implicated in some chronic diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Immunity is influenced by many factors, some of which are within our control. Getting recommended vaccines, for example, helps to build immunity against certain diseases. Beyond vaccines, there are several lifestyle factors that research shows also boost our body’s immune function.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What habits should people adopt if they want to boost their immune function? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  There are three important habits that people should consider. First, keep physically active. In addition to reducing your chance of developing chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease, exercise stimulates the immune system. Being physically active may lower your chance of dying from the flu or pneumonia, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n \n\n   \n  Second, cut down on ultraprocessed foods. These “junk foods” contain high amounts of chemicals like preservatives, emulsifiers, artificial colorings and dyes. Eating higher amounts of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespan  by more than 10% . These foods have also been linked with  inflammation and dysregulation .\n \n\n   \n  Lack of physical activity and higher consumption of ultraprocessed food are both associated with obesity, which is  linked  to impaired immune function. People should aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate to high-intensity exercise and should try to have a diet that emphasizes  whole foods  such as vegetables, lean meats, beans, whole grains and nuts.\n \n\n   \n  Third, aim for better sleep. Studies have shown that  sleep deprivation  induces immune changes that increase the risk of various diseases. And people who routinely get  fewer than seven hours  of sleep a night have a higher likelihood of developing high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.\n \n\n   \n  There are several methods that can help with improved sleep. Many people struggle because they simply don’t have enough time in bed.  Try to prioritize  at least eight hours in bed and aim to go to bed and to rise around the same time every day. Other elements of good sleep hygiene include not using screens before sleep and optimizing your sleep environment with a cool, quiet and dark place.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there habits that people should consider stopping to improve their immune systems?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes. The most important are to avoid smoking and excessive alcohol.\n \n\n   \n   Many studies  have linked smoking to both short- and  long-term  effects on immunity, including impairing the body’s ability to fight viral and bacterial infections. Some of these effects are reversed by smoking cessation.  Excessive alcohol intake  can also weaken immune system response.\n \n\n   \n  Individuals who wish to quit smoking can speak with a physician about options. There are medications that can help in addition to nicotine replacement therapies.\n \n\n   \n  The holidays may be a tough time to cut back on alcohol consumption, but people should try to  avoid binge drinking  and to keep within  guidelines of drinking in moderation  (two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women on days when alcohol is consumed).\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Is it too late to get vaccinated against respiratory viruses if you are going to family gatherings with newborns or older adults?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  It can take a couple of weeks for the body to build up antibody responses after vaccination. In general, it’s definitely a good idea to be sure you are up to date with your recommended vaccines and to be sure to get your annual flu and Covid-19 vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  If you are getting together in, say, a few days from now with vulnerable loved ones, obtaining the shots now probably won’t change your protection during this visit, but it’s still a good idea to get them since it will certainly help you throughout the respiratory virus season.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What should vulnerable people do to reduce their risk of getting sick during the holidays? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  They should try to avoid crowded settings with many people shouting and speaking loudly. They should consider masking with an N95 or equivalent mask while traveling and in crowded public places.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there other virus safety tips people can use to reduce their chance of getting sick during the holidays? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Don’t forget to wash your hands often and well with soap and water. If you are hosting an event, consider asking those who have signs of respiratory infection like fever and cough to stay home.\n \n\n   \n  And please enjoy the holidays! Loneliness and feeling isolated can actually  impair  the immune system. The holidays  may be tiring and stressful , but being together with those you love —  whether it’s family or your family of friends  — can bring many benefits to your emotional and physical health.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/state-department-freedom-speech-human-rights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:08:00-05:00","title":"State Department to identify DEI policies and mass migration as ‘human rights infringements’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. State Department, under the Trump administration, is revising its annual human rights report to label DEI policies, mass migration, and state-funded abortion medications as 'human rights infringements.'

By Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:08 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US State Department will require its diplomats describe enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, alleged facilitation of mass migration, and government funding that supports abortion medications as “human rights infringements” in its next human rights report, a senior State Department official said Thursday, as the Trump administration moves to further align the report with its domestic politics.\n \n\n   \n  The report will also shift focus to “natural rights” like freedom of speech, the official said, in a move likely to target traditional European allies for alleged freedom of speech restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department instructed all embassies and consulates in a diplomatic cable Thursday to begin preparing the congressionally required annual report, which is meant to describe human rights abuses in countries around the world. The official said they are encouraging diplomats to “go out in the field, talk to people, collect data that then informs the report.”\n \n\n   \n  The new requirements further institutionalize changes seen in the  latest report released in August , which covered the 2024 calendar year. They also align with the administration’s domestic priorities.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday the State Department called migration “an existential threat to Western civilization” and said it instructed its diplomats “to report on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration.”\n \n\n   \n  Top administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have  lambasted European nations  over allegations of free speech backsliding while also meeting with far-right European political figures. At the same time, the administration has also revoked and denied visas for alleged antisemitic speech and comments made about the murder of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\n \n\n   \n  The senior State Department official said Thursday that they “are moving away from group identities, group labels, and focusing on the fact that when a person is persecuted for whatever reason, that is a violation of the moral law.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re making sure that we’re promoting individual freedom not based on some group identity,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The official described a catalogue of “infringements on human rights” that diplomats preparing the report will be required to note.\n \n\n   \n  These include “arrests, administrative penalties, and ‘official investigations or warnings’ for speech; the enforcement of policies like affirmative action of diversity, equity, and inclusion that ‘provide preferential treatment’ to workers on the basis of race, sex, or caste; the facilitation of mass or illegal migration across a country’s territory into other countries;” gender affirming care for minors; and “state subsidization of abortions or abortifacient drugs.” They will also be required to note “the total estimated number of annual abortions.”\n \n\n   \n  “In recent years, new destructive ideologies have given safe harbor to human rights violations. The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked,” State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A former senior State Department official who worked on human rights decried the changes, arguing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio “is abandoning decades of bipartisan U.S leadership on universal human rights, and replacing it with a dangerous theocratic ideology that has more in common with The Handmaid’s Tale than with the Declaration of Independence.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is yet another example of the Trump Administration sacrificing the rights and principles that generations of Americans have fought and died for, and that generations of people around the world looked to for moral inspiration,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The latest report, which was released in August, was  drastically pared down  from past years. It alleged “significant human rights issues” in allied countries including the United Kingdom, France and Germany over “serious restrictions on freedom of expression.”\n \n\n   \n  That report had been stripped of specific sections of reporting on alleged abuses based on sexual orientation, violence toward women and systemic racial or ethnic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The future report is “really going to reflect what’s going on in the country,” the senior State Department official said.\n \n\n   \n  “For instance, in Western Europe, we see a backsliding of the protection of freedom of expression. So of course, we’re going to prioritize that versus another country that is maybe not curtailing free speech as much,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to Western Europe, we’re not saying that we’re favoring one opposition party or one particular political group. We’re saying all groups, all parties, all people should be able to speak freely, and that includes on the internet. That includes on social media,” the senior State Department official said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “In Europe, the (Digital Services Act) is a regulatory regime that restricts speech online,” the official said, referencing a sweeping EU law that requires Big Tech platforms to take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.\n \n\n   \n  The official noted that the human rights report, formally known as the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, is used “as a tool to change the behavior of governments.”\n \n\n   \n  “When our European friends are restricting free speech, we’ll have a conversation, and if they make changes, we will note that in the future report,” they said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/connor-grubb-murder-acquittal-takiya-young","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:43:00.000-05:00","title":"Officer Acquitted in Death of Ta’Kiya Young, a Pregnant Black Mother Accused of Shoplifting","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Ohio police officer, Connor Grubb, was acquitted of all charges, including murder, in the shooting death of 21-year-old Ta’Kiya Young, a pregnant Black mother accused of shoplifting at a Kroger store in Blendon Township.

Bodycam recordings showed Young refusing to exit her car and then turning her steering wheel to the right, before her car began slowly rolling forward against the body of Grubb, who fired one shot into her chest through the windshield.\n \n\n   \n  Franklin County Common Pleas Judge David Young, no relation to Ta’Kiya, dropped four of 10 counts relating to the death of Young’s unborn daughter, agreeing with defense attorneys that prosecutors failed to present proof that Grubb knew Young was pregnant when he shot her.\n \n\n   \n  Jurors were shown the  bodycam video  on the first day of the two-week trial, and heard testimony from a use-of-force expert, an accident reconstructionist, a police policy expert and Sgt. Erick Moynihan, the officer who with Grubb had ordered Young out of her car.\n \n\n   \n  They never heard from Grubb, whose side of the story was contained in a written statement read into the record by a special agent for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. He attended the trial, but prosecutors were unable to question him directly.\n \n\n   \n  Grubb and Moynihan had approached Young’s parked car on Aug. 24, 2023, about a report that she was suspected of stealing alcohol from a Kroger store in the Columbus suburb. She partially lowered her window and protested as both officers cursed at her and yelled at her to get out. Bodycam video showed Grubb had his left hand on the car’s hood while pointing his gun at her with his right. Young could be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?”\n \n\n   \n  Then, she put on a turn signal and her car rolled slowly forward toward Grubb, who fired a single bullet into her chest, the recording showed.\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Grubb said he had positioned himself in front of Young’s vehicle to provide backup and to protect other people in the parking lot. He said he drew his gun after he heard Young fail to comply with Moynihan’s commands. When her car moved toward him, he said, he felt the vehicle hit his legs and shins and begin to lift his body off the ground as he shot.\n \n\n   \n  Moments later, after the car came to a stop against the building, they broke the driver’s side window. Police said they tried to save her life, but she was mortally wounded. Young and her unborn daughter were pronounced dead at a hospital.\n \n\n   \n  A full-time officer with the township since 2019, Grubb was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Young had two young sons, ages 8 and 5, who are being raised by Ta’Kiya’s grandmother, Nadine Young. Attorney Sean Walton, representing her family, told the AP shortly after the shooting that Young had not stolen anything. He said his law firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “The bottles were left in the store,” Walton said. “So when she’s in her car denying that, that’s accurate. She did not commit any theft, and so these officers were not even within their right to place her under arrest, let alone take her life.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/uk/former-reform-uk-leader-jailed-for-accepting-pro-russian-bribes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:02:00.000Z","title":"Former Reform UK Leader Nathan Gill Jailed for Bribes to Make Pro-Russian Statements","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nathan Gill, a former leader in Reform UK Wales and former member of the European Parliament through UKIP, has been sentenced to ten and a half years in prison for accepting tens of thousands of pounds in cash bribes from pro-Russian Ukrainian figures between December 2018 and July 2019.

    11:30 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The White House is preparing for possible turnover in the Cabinet after President Donald Trump reaches the one-year mark of his term, potentially shaking up his otherwise stable team of secretaries, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s cadre of secretaries, administrators and directors that form the official Cabinet has so far been relatively steady — by design, as officials close to the president aimed to avoid the imagery of Trump’s  turnover-filled  first term in office. But that could change as he completes his first year back in office in January.\n \n\n   \n  At least one of the federal agencies that could see change is the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency helmed by Kristi Noem that is charged with executing Trump’s campaign  promise of mass deportation . Sources also said there could be turnover in the Department of Energy, currently run by  Chris Wright , a former Colorado fracking executive whose relationship with the White House has frayed in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  While there are ongoing discussions, officials stressed that no decisions have been made, and the Cabinet is expected to remain the same at least through the start of next year.\n \n\n   \n  “The cabinet is not changing no matter how much CNN wishes that it would because it thrives off drama,” said White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.\n \n\n   \n    Friction at Homeland Security\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself is happy with Noem, multiple sources told CNN, and he has consistently praised her in public and private settings. But behind the scenes, some top White House officials have become frustrated with chief adviser Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Noem confidante who was tapped early on to serve at DHS as a special government employee — a temporary status.\n \n\n   \n  “The President loves Kristi. He loves the job she’s doing,” one senior White House official told CNN, pushing back on the notion that the former South Dakota governor was on the chopping block.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s history with Noem, dating back to when she was governor, and their dual leadership of the department has prompted questions about whether the two would leave together, therefore opening the head position at DHS.\n \n\n   \n  A familiar face in Trump’s orbit who helped run his 2016 campaign, Lewandowski has become ensconced at DHS and is often at Noem’s side. The enormous power he’s amassed has also put him in the crosshairs of some senior White House officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, he likes [Noem], but it has been brought to his attention that [Lewandowski] is a problem, and the agency is being mismanaged because of it,” a person close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  At DHS, Lewandowski has  directed the firings of personnel , requested employees be put on administrative leave, called agency leaders “to hold them accountable,” and been described as a micro-manager — including for the massive infusion of cash the department has received to ramp up deportations. Multiple sources told CNN Lewandowski has developed a reputation at the department of reprimanding officials who he views as slowing down the administration’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  “The tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security – a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens – at President Trump’s direction and under Secretary Noem’s leadership, speak for themselves,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  And a DHS spokesperson said in response to CNN’s questions: “Mr. Lewandowski certainly has reputation of reprimanding officials who impede or slow down the administration and undermine the will of the American people—the American people voted for Donald J. Trump, not a bureaucrat.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, Trump convened a meeting with Lewandowski and Noem over the management of DHS, according to two people familiar with the event. One person said the Oval Office sit-down grew contentious, particularly between Lewandowski and Trump, who left the meeting irritated with Lewandowski. The tense meeting was notable to some inside the White House who believe that Lewandowski has only survived because of his strong relationship with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s relationship with many in Trump’s inner circle, including Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, is strained after the 2024 campaign, according to multiple people in and around the White House. Lewandowski was brought on to work for then-campaign co-chairs Wiles and Chris LaCivita just months before Election Day, with the candidate telling his former campaign manager he missed the old days of his first run for the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic quickly devolved into a power struggle, with Wiles and LaCivita irked by Lewandowski’s efforts to constantly assert himself in high-level decisions, often taking his opinions directly to Trump, people familiar with the discussions told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski  was sidelined  before the campaign ended, and he didn’t score a top position in the West Wing. Instead, he ended up at Homeland Security with a  temporary job status  that is supposed to last for only 130 workdays in a yearlong period. Though Lewandowski began working for DHS soon after Trump returned to office, the spokesperson said he still had 40 days remaining.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the current relationship, a White House official noted that Wiles had a meeting with Noem and Lewandowski regarding FEMA this week.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, DHS often caught the ire of the president over not doing enough to clamp down on immigration. Over the course of that term, the department had five secretaries, three of whom served in acting capacities.\n \n\n   \n    Other Cabinet questions\n \n\n   \n  Wright has also found himself on the outs with the White House recently, people familiar with the dynamics told CNN, prompting speculation his job atop the Energy Department might be in a precarious position. The people familiar said that some White House officials have privately complained that Wright was slow-walking some initiatives that Trump promised during his campaign and that he has contributed to high turnover in some of the agency’s top jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Wright has been working lockstep with President Trump since day one to restore America’s energy dominance and safeguard our economic and national security,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. “Thanks to the Trump Administration’s historic efforts to ‘DRILL, BABY, DRILL’, oil production hit an all-time record high in July while prices at the pump have fallen to the lowest in years.”\n \n\n   \n  Energy Department spokesman Ben Dietderich also pushed back on the idea that Wright’s standing was shaky. “Just last week, President Trump  called  Secretary Wright ‘the number one energy person anywhere in the world.’ No serious person is buying this anonymously sourced fake news,” Dietderich told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t the first time that a Cabinet secretary has appeared to be on thin ice in Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the possible replacement of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was  discussed at length  after the revelation that he had accidentally shared sensitive information on a Signal chain to which a reporter had been added. Over the summer, Trump  grew annoyed  with Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, over her stance on Iran’s nuclear capability.\n \n\n   \n  Both Hegseth and Gabbard have remained in their jobs, but pressure to replace Hegseth could resurface in the coming weeks as the Pentagon’s internal watchdog is expected to release its report on the Signal incident, which — while not carrying any formal sanction for the Defense Secretary — could return the issue to the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n    Youngkin in the wings?\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited out of office in January, is among the Republican leaders expected to be under consideration for any potential openings in the Cabinet or administration. While the president has praised Youngkin, several Republicans close to Trump say, the two men have not had a direct conversation about any prospective role.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin, who turns 59 next month, saw his endorsed successor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears,  defeated in a landslide  on Nov. 4 in an embarrassing loss for the governor and his fellow Republicans in the state.\n \n\n   \n  In a call with supporters before that election, Youngkin showered Trump with praise.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I want to thank you,” Youngkin said. “You’ve cut trade deals, peace deals, you’ve brought huge investments back to the United States. I know that you will always put America first.”\n \n\n   \n  The president responded in kind, calling Youngkin “one of the great governors in our country.” Trump added, “We’re very proud of you and the job you’ve done.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor has told allies that he would be excited by the prospect of joining the Cabinet, should a vacancy arise, but he has expressed more interest in an economic or business portfolio, rather than one focused on immigration. One longtime friend, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Youngkin would likely be reluctant to assume the reins of Trump’s aggressive deportation policies at the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been made clear that [Youngkin] is interested in working for the administration in some capacity,” one senior White House official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Youngkin did not respond to a request for comment about the governor’s plans when he leaves office in January.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin is weighing his political future, allies say, even though he is uncertain whether he could find a suitable opening to match his ambitions. He made summer trips to Iowa and South Carolina, two key stops in any Republican presidential primary, to meet party activists and keep his options open.\n \n\n   \n  Some Cabinet turnover is expected in any administration. During former President Joe Biden’s administration, the departments of Housing and Urban Development as well as Labor saw changes at the top, but neither vacancy occurred in the first two years.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/style/strauss-watch-titanic-auction-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:11:00-05:00","title":"Titanic Love Story: The Pocket Watch of Isidor and Ida Straus Now for Sale","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Isidor and Ida Straus, a prominent couple from New York, are remembered as one of the most iconic pairs of victims of the Titanic disaster in 1912.

An agency spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, also denied in a post to social media on Friday that the Coast Guard was “backtracking” by issuing the latest memo.\n \n\n   \n  “The 2025 policy is not changing—USCG issued a lawful order that doubles down on our *current* policies prohibiting the display, distribution or use of hate symbols by Coast Guard personnel,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nooses symbolize the legacy of  racial hatred and terror  in the United States that saw thousands of Black people lynched between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. Swastikas epitomize Adolf Hitler’s murderous regime in Nazi Germany, which killed millions of people during the Holocaust and sparked a war in which more than 400,000 American service members — including about 1,900 who served in the Coast Guard — also died.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Lauren Underwood, an Illinois Democrat, said she met with the Coast Guard’s acting commandant, Admiral Kevin Lunday, to express concerns about the update to the policy. She said she received a commitment from him that the policy would change and become more restrictive.\n \n\n   \n  “He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,” Underwood said in a  video statement .\n \n\n   \n  Lunday also insisted in a statement Thursday that swastikas and other “extremist imagery” remain prohibited in the Coast Guard.\n \n\n   \n  “Any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished,” he said. “Symbols such as swastikas, nooses and other extremist or racist imagery violate our core values and are treated with the seriousness they warrant under current policy.”\n \n\n   \n  The military at times  has struggled  with combatting extremism among their service members. A  2020 Pentagon report  found that extremist views were not widespread in the military, but said the issue was still urgent due to the ability of people with military experience to carry out “high-impact events.”\n \n\n   \n  During President Joe Biden’s term, Secretary of Defense  Lloyd Austin  in 2021 ordered a staggered pause in operations across the military so commanders could have discussions with their service members about the issue of extremism.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed the idea of there being an issue with extremism in the military. During  his confirmation hearing  in January, Hegseth said a focus on extremism has “created a climate inside our ranks that feel political when it hasn’t ever been political.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-analysis-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:19:00-04:00","title":"Trump is giving Russia almost everything it wants with his Ukraine peace plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked 28-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump is widely seen as a dangerous reversal for Ukraine, echoing Russia’s maximalist demands from 2022.

It was co-conceived by Russians who wanted to pretend they were engaging in peace, and circulated by Ukrainians and Europeans who felt it was so ridiculous it would surely die on first contact with oxygen.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the text resembles the maximalist  positions Russia held during talks in Istanbul in 2022 when its forces held more of Ukraine, and the slow, grinding    military embarrassment of the past three years was still ahead of them. Before we dissect the text - and its profound, dizzying advantages for the Kremlin - the timing of this renewed, mostly Moscow-initiated plan, is key.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s forces are perhaps in their best position for about a year.   They are weeks, even days, away from taking the embattled eastern military hub of Pokrovsk, a place of outsized significance and great strategic import, grimly fought over since last summer. Their forces are at  its southern edges, and if they take it would  encounter few sizeable population centers to their west that are under Ukrainian control before they near the capital, Kyiv. That land is mostly flat and open, ideal for a swift advance. Moscow has also had a breakout across Zaporizhzhia region, using armor and moving its forces perilously close to Zaporizhzhia city, taking, again, open and flat territory that will remain vulnerable during winter.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine continues to see high desertion rates and draft-avoidance, adding to its serious manpower issues and Kyiv’s drone advantage has been eroded by swift Russian learning and innovation. President Volodymyr Zelensky is also suffering a popularity nadir – facing the repercussions of an ongoing and intimately detailed corruption scandal that touches both his inner circle and the very thing Ukrainians must endure daily – energy outages.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian initiative is obviously set to exploit Ukraine’s moment of perhaps unprecedented vulnerability   – when a domestic political crisis threatens to hobble Zelensky in confronting frontline emergencies. The appalling timing for Kyiv may also explain why Moscow has bothered to – yet again – present a series of maximalist demands that Ukraine and its allies have also flatly and repeatedly dismissed. One European diplomat   described it as Groundhog Day. But in the movie, the rub of that day on repeat was not that it became predictable and tedious, but that you were forced to constantly relive it.\n \n\n   \n  The 28 leaked points serve two purposes for Moscow. They present a starting block that is so advantageous that even achieving parts of it would be a huge win. And they also provide an edifice to which Russian diplomats can constantly return if they wish to, yet again, slow-roll diplomacy while their military has the advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Demands that Ukraine constitutionally reject NATO membership, de-Nazify, guarantee its neutrality and limit the size of its armed forces were in the Istanbul 2022 document. Then, at the height of the Russian invasion’s initial ambition they were an amorphous set of maximalist terms that amounted to a form of Ukrainian surrender.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has survived formidably since that gambit but has been weakened by the fight.\n \n\n   \n  The use of $100 billion in frozen Russian funds to rebuild Ukraine appears, on the surface, to be a Russian concession. Yet the most brutalized parts of Ukraine are under Russian occupation, and this money would go to Russia to execute the rebuild under its terms. The deal proposes that half of any reconstruction profits would somehow go to the United States, and some of the money would be invested in other joint US-Russian projects. The scope for Moscow getting much of this cash back is vast, and the deal also proposes that international sanctions be lifted entirely, which would be a huge financial boon of its own.\n \n\n   \n  There are three other hidden shards of glass in this repeat serving of Russian diplomatic porridge. First is the demand for elections 100 days after a deal’s signature.\n \n\n   \n  This is, by most accounts, technically impossible given the challenges of demobilization, war-time logistics and legal reform. A rushed, poorly executed poll would be the outcome, yielding a government of questionable legitimacy and providing a space for misinformation and manipulation large enough for the Russians to drive another tank through, with their preferred candidate sat on top. Zelensky cannot accept this deadline, and a snap election was a Russian canard from earlier this year that the Trump administration seemed to drop. Its revival – and with it, discussion of Zelensky’s shelf life – re-emerges at a time of new weakness for this wartime leader.\n \n\n   \n  Second is the confusing concept of turning the parts of the eastern Donbas region currently under Ukrainian control into a demilitarized zone that is technically part of Russia. This amounts to surrendering them to Russian “civilian” forces. This is terrain Moscow would otherwise have to bitterly fight for over the next year. Even a compromise of declaring this area a demilitarized zone, from which the militaries of both sides are barred, feeds into Russia’s rich history of using “people’s militias” to infiltrate territory and declare a popular revolt in Moscow’s favor.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky cannot cede the city of Kramatorsk. It would yield Russian President Vladimir Putin a military bulwark from which to launch another, easier attack toward Kyiv across open ground, perhaps within months. It would open Zelensky up to internal political challenges. Moscow knows this, but keeps going back to it in the hope that eventually Trump is ground down into seeing this concession as a necessary part of any solution.\n \n\n   \n  Thirdly, the wording of the circulated deal is vague, and seems at times to be rush-translated from Russian or Ukrainian, containing several “snapback” clauses. One says Ukraine’s security guarantees will be “deemed invalid” if they fire a missile at “Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause” – a caveat of great consequence and breadth of interpretation. Russia will have a different view of what “cause” is great enough to that held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also demands all “Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected or prohibited” in Ukraine, a repeat of the Russian false talking –point that it is facing a Kyiv government run by Nazi extremists. Would the appearance of a far-right flag on a Ukrainian unit, or an SS Death’s Head emblem in an unofficial military Telegram page, suddenly void the deal? In its current form, the deal is something Moscow can walk out on at any time, with slim justification.\n \n\n   \n  If there is any Russian error in this document, it is not in its timing, or blunt obstinacy, but in its clear exposition that Moscow retains most of its maximalist demands as its starting point. That has in the past angered Trump, and indeed resulted in the most severe sanctions imposed yet by the US on Russia, against oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  But the Kremlin has correctly seen its steep advances on the battlefield, Ukraine’s domestic turbulence and serious frontline fragility, Europe’s concerns about how long it can fund Kyiv’s defense, and Trump’s overwhelming hunger for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2026, and tried to make the old sound new again.\n \n\n   \n  If it buys time, it works. If a third of it sticks, or becomes the lexicon of any future deal, it works. In the past year, almost everything else has been tried once. So, for Moscow, trying the same old, bad idea again makes total sense.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/mamdani-trump-white-house-meeting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:13:00.000Z","title":"Trump set to host Mamdani at the White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant political development, Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, has requested a face-to-face meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, marking a direct encounter between a progressive, democratic socialist leader and a conservative MAGA president.

He did a successful run, and we all know that runs are not easy, but I think we’ll get along fine,” Trump added of the mayor-elect.\n \n\n   \n  Just a day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeated the president’s frequent line of attack during the mayoral campaign when asked about the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,” Leavitt told reporters Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump urged voters in his native city to back Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, over the GOP nominee. (Mamdani  has said  he is not a communist despite the White House’s claims.) Trump had also threatened to halt the city’s federal funding if Mamdani won, and indicated openness to  seizing control  of the city – which could put the mayor-elect’s agenda at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s not about myself, it’s not about a relationship with an individual. It’s about a relationship between New York City and the White House,” Mamdani told reporters on Thursday previewing the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor-elect spent much of Thursday preparing for the meeting, including by holding calls with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Rev. Al Sharpton to discuss how to approach it and how best to communicate with Trump, according to an aide to Mamdani’s transition team. He also spoke with Robert Wolf, the former CEO of UBS Americas and a known ally of former President Barack Obama, according to Wolf’s  post on social media .\n \n\n   \n  The face-to-face between the leader of the MAGA movement and the self-described democratic socialist comes after Mamdani secured a commanding victory — winning more than 50% of the vote — with a focus on working-class issues. His strong performance — coupled with Democratic gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia — has, in part, fueled Trump’s attacks on “affordability” as a Democratic “con job.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Thursday suggested affordability is at the top of his agenda for Friday’s discussions.\n \n\n   \n  “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I’ll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we’ve been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has  promised action  to make public buses free and reduce the cost of living, including by opening government-run grocery stores, freezing the rent for 1 million rent-stabilized tenants in the city, and a plan to create New York City’s first universal childcare program.\n \n\n   \n  According to CNN exit polling, 27% of voters in the mayoral election approved of Trump, compared to 70% who disapproved. And while a majority of voters in the overwhelmingly blue city — 58% — said that Trump was not a factor in their vote, 32% said they cast their ballots to express opposition to the president.\n \n\n   \n  There is, however, crossover in the Venn-Diagram of voters who supported both Trump in 2024 and Mamdani this year: 10% of Trump’s voters voted for Mamdani, according to CNN exit polling.\n \n\n   \n  The city, Leavitt said Thursday, is “becoming much more left than I think this president ever anticipated in his many years of living in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  But she cast the meeting as a reflection of Trump’s willingness to “meet with anyone and talk to anyone.” Asked whether the president could be persuaded to abandon his threat to cut federal funding to New York, she declined to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated that threat the day after the election, while offering a glimmer of collegiality. “I thought it was a very angry speech, certainly angry toward me. And I think he should be very nice to me. You know, I’m the one that sort of has to approve a lot of things coming to him, so he’s off to a bad start,” he told Fox News’ Bret Baier.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York. I really love New York,” the president added.\n \n\n   \n  But Mamdani also offers Trump — and his party — a political foil ahead of the 2026 midterms. The soon-to-be lame duck president, who has focused on rivals like former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, could make the mayor-to-be, who takes office January 1, his new boogeyman.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance, who may have his own higher political ambitions, has no interest in Friday’s get-together.\n \n\n   \n  “I might have a stomach bug,” he joked at a Thursday Breitbart News event.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s meeting with the president is taking place earlier than usual as he has not yet taken office. New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with Trump in the Oval Office in May 2025 and former Mayor Bill de Blasio met with him inside Trump Tower shortly after Trump was elected the first time in 2016. The meeting between Mamdani and Trump is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Trump indicated that the meeting, which is currently closed to press, will likely open to reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fine with me, I would think so. He’s a politician, so I don’t think he has a problem,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/sport/football-nfl-texans-bills-week-12-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:38:00+00:00","title":"Referee carted off field with injury as Texans’ defense roughs up Buffalo Bills to give Houston big upset win","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Houston Texans defeated the Buffalo Bills 23-19 in a dramatic and physically intense NFL game, featuring a key injury to referee Adrian Hill, who was carted off the field after a non-contact incident in the third quarter.

Buffalo Bills to give Houston big upset win \n       \n  By Patrick Sung, Jill Martin, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:38 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thursday night’s  NFL  game between the Houston Texans and Buffalo Bills was a rough and tumble affair, featuring injuries aplenty – including to one of the officials.\n \n\n   \n  Referee Adrian Hill had to be carted off the field following a non-contact injury in the third quarter of the Texans’ 23-19 win at NRG Stadium. Hill came up limping after a play and the game was stopped as medical staff looked him over before it was decided he would leave the contest.\n \n\n   \n  The referee, who was leading the officiating crew on the night, was replaced by umpire Roy Ellison, eliminating the  umpire position  for the remainder of the game.\n \n\n   \n  The rest of the evening was no less bruising, as the Texans’ vaunted defense – entering Thursday night No. 1 in scoring defense and total defense – lived up to its reputation by battering Bills QB Josh Allen and the rest of the Buffalo offense throughout the contest.\n \n\n   \n  Allen – who was coming off an  incredible six-touchdown performance  on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – had a rough night, completing 24-of-34 passes for 253 yards with two interceptions and no touchdowns and also being sacked a  career-worst eight times .\n \n\n   \n  Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said, “Credit goes to, first and foremost, our defensive line. For the way they go out, the way those guys relentlessly rush the passer and everybody on the back end is playing sound and playing together.\n \n\n   \n  “When we do that, we’re tough to move the ball against, so our players are doing an outstanding job.”\n \n\n   \n  Texans safety Calen Bullock was the standout player on the night, forcing three turnovers – two picks and a forced fumble – including the game-sealing interception with 24 seconds left in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n    Explosive first half\n \n\n   \n  The game started well for the Bills, with Buffalo taking an early 6-0 lead after James Cook cut through the middle of the Texans defense for an incredible 45-yard touchdown run.\n \n\n   \n  The teams exchanged field goals before Houston – which was playing without starting quarterback CJ Stroud for the third straight game due to concussion protocol – got a boost from its backup signal-calle. Davis Mills  threw a short, two-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Christian Kirk to put the Texans up 10-9 after the extra point.\n \n\n   \n  Bullock then nabbed his first interception of the evening, running it back for an apparent touchdown, only for a flag to have been thrown on the play on defensive end Danielle Hunter for blocking in the back. Houston ultimately settled for another field goal to extend the lead, but Buffalo hit right back off an explosive special teams play.\n \n\n   \n  Ray Davis caught the ensuing kickoff, clanging off a teammate and rolling to one side, before returning it 97 yards and front flipping into the end zone to put the Bills back on top with 1:43 left in the half.\n \n\n   \n  The fireworks weren’t done yet in the Lone Star State as the Texans ran a two-minute drill to perfection, with Mills throwing his second touchdown of the day to Jayden Higgins to cap off a six-play, 75-yard drive to put Houston up 20-16 at the half.\n \n\n   \n    Crunchtime heroics\n \n\n   \n  The third quarter began slowly with neither team doing much before Bullock came up big again. The Houston safety forced a fumble from Bills wideout Khalil Shakir after he made a catch with 4:15 left in the quarter, leading to yet another field goal from Texans kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn to make it 23-16 in favor of the home team.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills cut the lead to four after getting a field goal with 5:44 left in the game, and then came crunchtime.\n \n\n   \n  With 49 seconds left, Allen threw a pass on fourth-and-27 to Josh Palmer who then lateraled it to Shakir to convert and get the Bills dangerously close to the red zone and make the Texans faithful begin to worry.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-yard run sandwiched between two incompletions, Buffalo was facing another fourth down with the game on the line and Allen lined up in a shotgun formation. The defending league MVP dropped back and threw off his back foot, but the ball was intercepted by Houston hero Bullock, who sealed the contest with his pick.\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Texans coach Ryans expressed his relief at how the game ended, praising Bullock for his heroics: “Calen went out and intercepted the ball two times, forcing a fumble to get us in plus territory there.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of emotions going on on the sideline through that entire (final) drive, but for Calen to come down with that interception was my favorite play – because it meant it was over.”\n \n\n   \n  “A dream come true showing up on a stage like Thursday night. We are the only team on, everybody watching, the whole world watching, so a dream come true,” Bullock – who received the game ball for his performance –  told ESPN .\n \n\n   \n  With the win, Houston moves to 6-5 on the season, third in the AFC South, while the Bills drop to 7-4 and second in the AFC East, where they are in danger of falling out of reach of the surprising New England Patriots.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/trump-ukraine-peace-gaza-witkoff","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:47:00-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Rushes to Emulate Gaza Plan in New Push for Ukraine Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is rapidly advancing a new peace framework for Ukraine, directly modeled after its successful Gaza ceasefire deal.

Some US officials have said that the administration wants Russia and Ukraine to agree to a deal by the end of the year, according to two sources.\n \n\n   \n  Like the proposal the Trump administration crafted which led to the  ceasefire in Gaza , the Ukraine plan reads as a listicle of bullet points, laying out commitments each side would make in order to drive a lasting end to the conflict. Both proposals call for the halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing war, now approaching its fourth year, has fueled the frustrations of a US president who regularly touts his dealmaking ability and believes he has not received enough credit for overseeing other recent diplomatic successes, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, several top Trump administration officials have turned their focus back to the  war in Ukraine  and the US has considered enlisting some of the same foreign intermediaries who helped facilitate negotiations related to Gaza – including Qatar and Turkey – to play a more prominent, but still behind the scenes, diplomatic role, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the similarities to the Gaza ceasefire deal that appeared in the Ukraine framework for peace that emerged on Thursday, which US officials cautioned was not a final proposal, were very stark. Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, which is being overseen by a Trump-led “Board of Peace,” the draft proposal describes the Ukraine peace implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump,” according to a draft seen by CNN. The draft’s veracity was confirmed by a US official.\n \n\n   \n  The draft also included components that Russian diplomats have pushed and Ukrainian officials have previously rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the 28-point plan includes elements such as territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia, a limit on the size of Ukraine’s armed forces and a Ukrainian commitment in its constitution that it will not join NATO, the draft said. Reports emerged earlier this week that President Trump’s top envoy Steve Witkoff was working with Russia on the framework, which includes the Russian maximalist demands.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff has been working with Russian Special Envoy and the head of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund Kirill Dmitriev directly for many months and the two have remained engaged in crafting this new draft proposal, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As Europeans monitored reports that emerged on Tuesday that Witkoff had worked exclusively with Russian officials to develop the plan, some were on edge, according to six sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Europeans who said they had not been briefed on the details grew concerned about what the effort could mean for Ukraine – given their longstanding position that Ukraine must be involved in any discussions about a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Wednesday night, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tweeted that ending the war would require “an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas.” Rubio added that the Trump administration would continue “to develop a list of potential ideas” to end the Ukraine war, without saying any final proposal was being floated.\n \n\n   \n  Some Europeans let out a collective sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday nerves were up, today nerves are down,” said a diplomat based in Brussels on Thursday, explaining that Rubio’s tweet had appeared to chill the idea that a firm new deal was on the table that the US would be urging Ukraine to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “The president lets hundreds of flowers bloom,” the diplomat added, pointing to the possibility that the efforts could have been driven by Witkoff freelancing, but also noting that he is one of few people who has the official green-light do that from the president.\n \n\n   \n  A senior State Department official said that Rubio “was reiterating a point he has made for months – a diplomatic end to the war requires both sides to make concessions, and that cannot happen without ongoing dialogue.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that both Witkoff and Rubio “have been working on a plan quietly for about the last month.” She would not go into details of the plan, saying that it’s “ongoing” and “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt acknowledged that the administration was taking cues from its playbook on the Gaza ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff and Rubio, she said, have “been engaging with both sides, Russia and Ukraine equally, to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you get to a peace negotiation, right? That’s how it worked with Israel, with respect to Israel and Gaza and all of the Arab countries in the Middle East,” she said at a press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The new push comes just after  recent reports of corruption  inside Ukraine, which some administration officials believe leaves the Ukrainian government in a weakened state, and some Europeans are concerned about the US seeking to leverage that weakness.\n \n\n   \n  Still, other Europeans diplomats believe that a continued push towards a peace agreement is useful. One European diplomat explained that they viewed Witkoff’s current efforts as a natural evolution of continued US strategy to drive a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to look at it as an evolution of a negotiation. You take out points, dial up points… the two sides won’t get an agreement overnight,” the European said.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has not publicly endorsed the ongoing efforts. The Kremlin denied it is working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine this week, saying Thursday there were “no new developments” following a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if Russia and the US are currently working towards an end to the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that “there are no consultations as such currently underway. There are certainly contacts. But there is no process that could be called consultations. It is not ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  As of last week, Rubio still publicly said his assessment was Russia did not want peace.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve stated clearly what they want is they want the rest of Donetsk, and obviously the Ukrainians aren’t going to agree to that,” he told reporters after a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the assessment we have to make,” he said. “They’ve made a demand that Ukraine can’t agree to, and so that’s sort of where we are at this point.”\n \n\n   \n  When the top US diplomat spoke with his Russian counterpart by phone last month, officials felt that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, a source familiar with the matter said at the time. Potential meetings between Rubio and Lavrov and Trump and Putin did not move forward, despite Trump saying just a week prior that he planned to meet the Russian president.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials said that the reported plan is not the final product, and the fact that it has a number of items that had been pushed by Russia and previously rejected by Ukraine does not mean that is the expectation for an agreement at the end of the ongoing talks – including talks with Ukrainians.\n \n\n   \n  The plan was presented on Thursday to the Ukrainians by the Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, two sources said. While his trip to Ukraine was previously scheduled, it was an opportunity to share the current thinking on the revived push to end the war, the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian presidential office did not outright reject the current US efforts, saying Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, who becomes the primary Trump administration point person for the Ukrainians as the administration pushes – again – for a peace deal remains unclear. Throughout the last year, Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, has served as the chief Trump administration official communicating with the Ukrainians. But in recent months he has privately told people that he plans to depart early next year, which could leave a significant void until that role is filled.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/style/miss-universe-2025-finale-winner-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00-05:00","title":"Mexico’s Fatima Bosch crowned Miss Universe winner in glittering finale of scandal-hit pageant","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Fatima Bosch of Mexico won the Miss Universe 2025 title in a highly controversial finale marked by a walkout of contestants after a heated pre-pageant incident in which Thai director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly criticized her.

Universe winner in glittering finale of scandal-hit pageant \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:36 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fatima Bosch of Mexico has been named Miss Universe 2025 in a scandal-hit competition where she emerged as a fan favorite after she was  berated  by a Thai pageant director during a pre-pageant meeting, triggering a walk out by contestants.\n \n\n   \n  The 25-year-old humanitarian and volunteer was crowned by last year’s winner  Victoria Kjær Theilvig  from Denmark.\n \n\n   \n  Miss Universe is widely known as the “Super Bowl” of beauty pageants and draws millions of viewers each year. Delegates for each country are selected via local pageants that license local rights from the Miss Universe Organization.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Praveenar Singh came runner up, with Venezuela’s Stephany Abasali,  Philippines’ Ahtisa Manalo  and Ivory Coast’s Olivia Yacé also making it to the top 5.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand, this year’s host country, has a vibrant and lucrative pageant industry with one of the largest fanbases in Asia,  alongside the Philippines. \n \n\n   \n  The event featured representatives from 120 countries. Nadeen Ayoub became the first woman to represent  Palestinian people  at the pageant, and made it to the final 30 semifinalists before she was eliminated. Friday’s finale was hosted by American comedian Steve Byrne and opened with a performance by Thai singer Jeff Satur.\n \n\n   \n  Following the swimwear round, the top 30 contestants were narrowed down to 12, and then down to 5 after the evening round.\n \n\n   \n  Finalists were asked questions including which global issue they would speak about in front of the United Nations General Assembly, and how they would use the Miss Universe platform to empower young girls.\n \n\n   \n  “Believe in the power of your authenticity,” Bosch said. “Your dreams matter, your heart matters. Never let anyone make you doubt your worth.”\n \n\n   \n  The competition took place over three weeks, with delegates traveling around the country to rehearse and participate in events.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the beauty queens competed in the national costume showcase, which saw contestants donning flamboyant outfits designed to highlight their homelands. Miss USA, Audrey Eckert, paid homage to her home with an  elaborate bald eagle costume  designed by Simon Villalba.\n \n\n   \n  The contestant from Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, took a scary tumble during the evening gown round at Wednesday’s preliminaries and was carried away in a stretcher, according to social media videos which circulated of her fall. Miss Universe President Raul Rocha said in an  update to Instagram  that Henry was “under good care” in hospital and that she had not broken any bones.\n \n\n   \n    Pageant controversies\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Miss Universe competition was beset by controversy and internal drama in the weeks leading up to coronation night. The walk out sparked conversations over the merits of the international beauty pageant which claims to promote female empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  At a live-streamed pre-pageant meeting earlier this month, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly scolded Bosch ,  for not posting enough promotional content, appearing to call her a “dumbhead,” though Nawat denied this, insisting that he had actually accused her of causing “damage.”\n \n\n   \n  After Bosch pushed back against the insults, Nawat called security to escort her out of the room. Other contestants then stood up and walked out in solidarity.\n \n\n   \n  The incident drew global backlash, including from Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum, who described it as an “aggression” that Bosch handled with “dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum congratulated Bosch for winning the Miss Universe title during her morning press conference in Mexico City on Friday, praising the beauty queen for standing up to one of the competition hosts.\n \n\n   \n  “What I liked about her, aside from everything else, is that she speaks up when she feels there’s an injustice against her,” Sheinbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s an example for all Mexicans and for women…those old sayings at rallies, like ‘you look prettier when you’re quiet,’ are behind us,” Sheinbaum added.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization condemned Nawat’s behavior and limited his role in the pageant. Nawat apologized in a livestreamed welcome ceremony and declined to comment further on the incident to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, Miss Universe 1996, Alicia Machado, was criticized for making racist comments in an Instagram live video discussing the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Machado referred to Nawat as “that despicable Chinese,” and when a commentor pointed out he is Thai, Machado said “Chinese, Thai, Korean. To me all these people with slanted eyes like this are all Chinese,” while pulling up the corners of her eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s representative did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Judge steps down, says pageant is rigged\n \n\n   \n  Two judges abruptly stepped down from the competition days before the winner was crowned, with one accusing the pageant of being rigged.\n \n\n   \n  Composer Omar Harfouch said on Instagram he had resigned from the eight-member judging panel, and claimed there was a secret, “impromptu” panel of judges who had pre-selected the top 30 contestants in advance of the final.\n \n\n   \n  “I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,” Harfouch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization said Harfouch’s claims “mischaracterize” the judging process.\n \n\n   \n  “The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,” the organization said in a  statement. \n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A second judge, former French soccer star Claude Makélélé, stepped down the same day, citing “unforeseen personal reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard,” he said  on Instagram .\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization saw a leadership shakeup after Thai media tycoon Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip stepped down in June. Mario Búcaro was  appointed the new CEO  at the end of October, just days before delegates arrived. Jakkaphong, who is also a transgender rights advocate,  bought the organization for $20 million in 2022 , but her company  filed for bankruptcy  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Next year’s Miss Universe contest will take place in Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n   This article was updated with results and details of the competition.

Inside the store, rows of tortillas and shoulder-high stacks of canned hominy sit largely untouched, while the jewelry and travel kiosks are dark.\n \n\n   \n  A phone rings inside the store’s main office, and seconds later, Duran’s manager comes out. It was a tipster with intel that just a week ago  would have sounded  implausible:\n \n\n   \n   Suspected Customs and Border Patrol vehicles have been seen at a gas station a couple of blocks away. \n \n\n   \n  The manager walks over to the store’s entry and stands watch, ready to lock the front door at the first sign of federal agents. Her friendly eyes turn slightly dark.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t have no right to be in here,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  All along Central Avenue, the heart of this immigrant business community in East Charlotte, stark black-and-white signs now posted outside most businesses warn: “ICE is not welcome here.”\n \n\n   \n  The immigration action called Operation  Charlotte’s Web  has shocked and frightened the community, with hundreds of arrests and dozens of minority-owned businesses closed out of fear for their customers and their workers. Manolo’s Bakery, one of the most popular businesses in the neighborhood,  shuttered Saturday  after people were tackled outside the store by men in green uniforms.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte is the latest stop in a virtual four-corners tour of the country by Border Patrol Chief Control Agent  Gregory Bovino  and his agents, who this year have made weekslong visits to Los Angeles and Chicago, with  New Orleans  expected next. In contrast to their Windy City presence, Bovino and at least some of his team  left Charlotte  on Thursday, a Homeland Security official said, as elevated immigration enforcement continues.\n \n\n   \n  The strong shows of force against migrants in Democratic-led cities have become a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s intense immigration enforcement agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In the Charlotte area, more than 250 people were  arrested  over four days of immigration raids, the Department of Homeland Security  said  Wednesday. “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the agency  said .\n \n\n   \n  “Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin  said  in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, a protest outside Manolo’s against the federal effort builds throughout the day, growing to dozens of people and stretching the strip mall’s small parking lot to its limits.\n \n\n   \n    As popular bakery closes, community rises in support\n \n\n   \n  The demonstration began with just one man.\n \n\n   \n  Jerry Ortiz stands  alongside Central Avenue , waving a massive Puerto Rican flag featuring a tree frog called the coquí – with a songlike call that sounds like its name – as passing drivers honk their support. The frog, a native of Puerto Rico like Ortiz himself, is an important symbol of the island’s culture.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the car horns are music to his ears.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s beautiful,” Ortiz says.\n \n\n   \n  But not every note of Central Avenue’s cacophony supports his message.\n \n\n   \n  “Get them illegal sons of bitches out of here!” yells the passenger in one truck as it passes Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not an entirely surprising message in a county where  a third  of the votes cast in the last presidential election were for Donald Trump. Ortiz shrugs.\n \n\n   \n  “Something is wrong that they don’t appreciate us here,” he says. “We come here to work hard, to make this country better.”\n \n\n   \n  While Ortiz keeps watch along the street,  bakery owner  Manolo Betancur stops by several times a day to make sure federal agents haven’t returned and to talk to the growing crowd that cheers loudly as he raises a large American flag alongside the coquí.\n \n\n   \n  “My biggest concern right now is our children need to have their fathers and mothers next to them,” Betancur says.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of these people are so scared, they’re not going to have Thanksgiving (dinner),” adds Ortiz, standing a few feet from the locked entrance to Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  Even as the fear forced Betancur to close his business, supporters are still paying for cakes from Manolo’s through the bakery’s website. He contacts them to make sure they understand he can’t fulfill the order right now.\n \n\n   \n  “They say, ‘No, it’s a donation,’” says Betancur.\n \n\n   \n  More protesters show up outside Manolo’s as midday approaches. Brandi Yanes is supporting people who now feel the pain she felt in 2018, when her husband was  detained by ICE  after a sheriff’s office identified him as undocumented following an altercation at a bar, she says.\n \n\n   \n  “Once he came home, my daughter was 6 months old. He had four months with us, and then he had to self-deport to Honduras,” Yanes says.\n \n\n   \n  Though they talk on the phone almost daily, Yanes’ daughter – now almost 8 years old – hasn’t seen her father in person in two years.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, with (immigration agents) being back here, and she’s seeing what’s going on, she’s waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning, crying,” says Yanes. “She’s asking, ‘Are my friends going to be OK?’”\n \n\n   \n  Betancur looks on at the crowd, growing to dozens by midafternoon, with appreciation.\n \n\n   \n  “If it weren’t for the immigrant community, I wouldn’t have a business,” says Betancur. “They are my customers. They are my employees.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the economic losses he is facing, Betancur has the one thing that is priceless for any immigrant: citizenship. He now carries his US passport with him everywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n    Immigrants made the community what it is, neighbors say\n \n\n   \n  Dianna Ward gave up a high-paying corporate career to start her own tour business, and she knows how to weave in history lessons at Charlotte’s hot spots. But when showing off the Plaza Midwood neighborhood where she lives, she chooses an unlikely starting point:  Evergreen Cemetery .\n \n\n   \n  “Look over here,” she says, pointing to a row of headstones from the 1940s. “It’s all Greek.” Other graves show the names of Italian and Jewish residents who helped build the community.\n \n\n   \n  “This has always been an immigrant community,” says Ward. “Immigrants claimed it and have done a beautiful job of making this a place you want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Ward points to million-dollar historic homes, Vietnamese restaurants, an Irish pub and bohemian art as signs of her  neighborhood’s diversity .\n \n\n   \n  “But this is my favorite place,” she says while passing the Central Avenue location of Tacos El Nevado. It is noon, and the restaurant is completely dark, chairs stacked up on the tables.\n \n\n   \n  “It is usually so packed in this restaurant, but look at it now.”\n \n\n   \n    Some stores stay open, even with fewer workers and customers\n \n\n   \n  With the earlier  threat of federal agents  turning out to be false alarm, things pick up a bit by midday at the Sav/Way, where the bustling lunch counter is serving up massive tortas piled impossibly high with meat and jalapeños.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike an average day before Operation Charlotte’s Web, there is no 30-minute wait to be served.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we lose money, we need to keep it open if we can,” says Sav/Way owner Rudy Montero, whose weathered face and gray moustache are the only visible signs of his 72 years. After decades of seven-day weeks running the store, Montero still comes every day to take deliveries and energetically supervise.\n \n\n   \n  “You need to be positive all the time,” says Montero. “I feel terrible about this, but we need to keep going.”\n \n\n   \n  Montero’s positivity is matched by one of his most enthusiastic lunch counter customers, Jesse Pacheco-Anguiano. Wearing a beaded crucifix over the number “7” on his shirt in honor of Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, he gives new visitors the lowdown on his favorites.\n \n\n   \n  “The Cubana is a big, big torta,” he emphasizes. “Do you have a big appetite?”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano is a home renovation contractor who  depends on day laborers , including a worker he saw being picked up by Border Patrol agents in their now-familiar green uniforms and facemasks at a Lowe’s on Saturday, the first day of the Charlotte operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I was born and raised here in Charlotte my whole life, and this is the first time in my life I’ve seen this happen,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano says the agents left him alone after checking his driver’s license, but agents drove away with his worker in two unmarked crossovers, leaving a half-loaded stack of lumber still sticking out of the back of the customized work van with the name of his business covering both sides.\n \n\n   \n  “Look at this. They’re embarrassing me,” he says in Spanish in a cell phone video of the encounter he took and shared with CNN. DHS has not responded to CNN’s questions about this incident.\n \n\n   \n    The crackdown becomes a costly burden on small businesses\n \n\n   \n  With his business effectively shut down, Pacheco-Anguiano joins the protesters when he can. Starting his own business was a long-time dream, and he wants to use what he has to help those who can’t speak up.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just trying to protest for my people who don’t have a voice, and I’m here for them,” Pacheco-Anguiano says.\n \n\n   \n  The full economic impact of the immigration enforcement operation is not clear, but CharlotteEAST, a nonprofit community organization, says small businesses  are struggling .\n \n\n   \n  “For a little tienda, (it’s costing) $400 a day. A hair salon, $500. A restaurant, $5,000 a day,” says the executive director, Greg Asciutto.\n \n\n   \n  His group looks out for about 400 mom-and-pop businesses in East Charlotte, about half of them owned by immigrants, Asciutto says.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, our whole commercial thoroughfare is shut down, right?” he says. “And these are American citizens. These are American-owned businesses.”\n \n\n   \n  The economic strain is showing not just on business owners but also on workers. Even as the immigration raids go on, Pacheco-Anguiano continues to get calls from workers asking for a gig, telling him they have no choice as their money begins to dry up, he says.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re willing to take the risk, but I’m like, ‘Dude, I can’t have that on my conscience if anything happens on the way from here to your house,’” says Pacheco-Anguiano.\n \n\n   \n    Community members show support with their dollars\n \n\n   \n  With Manolo’s Bakery closed, Pacheco-Anguiano moves down Central Avenue to Panadería Odalys, where traditional Latino pastries sit alongside doughnuts and slices of vanilla-iced cake with sprinkles, loading up a pan of treats for family and friends.\n \n\n   \n  About half of the display cases are  uncharacteristically empty , a sign of the difficulty owner Cervantes Almanza is having in finding enough staff who feel safe going to work. But he points to the 5-foot-high racks of baked goods just rolled out into the center of the store.\n \n\n   \n  “Have some. They’re fresh!” says Almanza in Spanish, an announcement made redundant by the aroma that quickly fills the room.\n \n\n   \n  A new customer is unprepared for the store’s cash-only policy, but Almanza gives a silent wave and head shake to show this one is on the house, his gratitude for the community’s support. (A veteran Odalys customer quietly slips money over the counter to pay the bill while Almanza isn’t looking.)\n \n\n   \n  Since Lolo Pendergrast found out Odalys was open but struggling with a reduced staff, she buys as many pastries as she can stuff into an oversized delivery box.\n \n\n   \n  “I got a whole bunch now, and I’m just going around town and handing them out to protesters,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  Pendergrast is retired from teaching English as a Second Language at Merry Oaks International Academy, a public elementary school.\n \n\n   \n  “The people that live right next to it, they’re our friends, our neighbors, you know, and they’re not illegal,” said Pendergrast. “I do not understand how we’ve gotten so off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n    Keeping an eye out for the ‘ Migra’ \n \n\n   \n  Almanza stays vigilant, looking out his bakery’s front door. His workers pick up on a sudden change in mood that takes the air out of the room. The owner doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to.\n \n\n   \n  As Almanza quietly slides the door open for a closer look,  a panicked voice  shouts from behind the building.\n \n\n   \n  “ Migra !  Migra !” a woman yells, feverishly ringing a cowbell.\n \n\n   \n  She runs fast through a residential street into the back of the Odalys parking lot, tailing a pair of unmarked vehicles that quickly blast a siren at oncoming traffic before making sharp right turns onto Central Avenue. Another vehicle follows, with a protester lying on the horn.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to make sure everybody’s good,” the woman says, now leaning over with a hand on one knee to catch her breath before returning to work.\n \n\n   \n  The Odalys employees  feel some relief  as they go back to their jobs, but a reminder of the toll this is taking on the neighborhood remains just outside their windows. Next door, the popular Salvadoran restaurant Morazán remains closed, the parking lot empty.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m born and raised in East Charlotte,” says neighbor Jorge Neri-Moreno, standing next to the shuttered restaurant, “and seeing all this breaks my heart.”\n \n\n   \n    Some children skip class, and volunteers try to keep schools safe\n \n\n   \n  Outside Shamrock Gardens Elementary School, parents Patricia Hoke and Laura Blum sit in lawn chairs at the entrance on Anne Street, a large handwritten poster next to them saying, “NO ICE.” They’re part of a network of volunteers waiting outside  local schools  during drop-off and pickup hours with whistles around their necks, watching for federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea is if we see them, we alert,” Blum says. “And I think it’s just a presence for people to know their community’s behind them.”\n \n\n   \n  There have been no immigration raids outside Charlotte schools so far, but the mothers’ work mixes a strong sense of purpose with a lingering sense of paranoia.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone feels on edge, even though it’s quiet,” says Hoke.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students – about 20% of district enrollment – were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said.\n \n\n   \n  To make sure as many East Charlotte schools as possible are covered, many parent volunteers are now communicating using encrypted messaging apps, just in case they’re being monitored themselves.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned to use Signal yesterday,” says Blum with a slight smile.\n \n\n   \n    Some businesses stay open – but locked up\n \n\n   \n  Before getting back to the protests – his new job for the time being – Pacheco-Anguiano has one more stop to make, pulling his work van into the parking lot at La Reina de las Carnitas, where the smell of fried pork and freshly made tortillas usually draws an overflow crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Owner Ricardo Albarrán immediately gives Pacheco-Anguiano a smile and a fatherly arm around the shoulder. The visitor didn’t just come here for food. Just a few years earlier, Pacheco-Anguiano worked here before striking out on his own with the renovation business. Now, he wants to  check up on  his old boss.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán says he closed at 2 p.m. on the day Operation Charlotte’s Web started and stayed closed through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On the first day he tried to reopen the shop, only two employees showed up for work. The rest were too afraid. Now, Albarrán keeps the front deadbolt latched until a worker at the door is comfortable that whoever is approaching is a customer.\n \n\n   \n  “Every business is doing the same thing to protect the people,” he says in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán sees would-be customers doing their own surveillance, trying to figure out whether an officer in the parking lot, or even just an SUV with tinted windows, might be from Border Patrol, making the short trip from a car to his door too risky.\n \n\n   \n  “ ¿Sí o no? ¿Sí o no? ” they seem to be asking themselves as they assess the level of danger, he says.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán has  enormous pride  in his business, he says as he begins speaking in English for emphasis.\n \n\n   \n  “I came from Mexico, and this is my dream,” he says. “All countries have good people. I don’t know why (this is happening).”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano gets another pat on the shoulder and heads out, happy to see his old workplace has been able to stay in operation. But as he exits the carnicería, the sound of the door lock clicking behind him is a stark reminder of the reality his community is still facing.\n \n\n   \n  “You know how they say they come for criminals?” he asks. “I think that’s not right. Because we’re here just trying to get a job done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dianne Gallagher and Lacey Russell contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/entertainment/ariana-grande-covid-wicked-for-good","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:34:00-05:00","title":"The ‘Wicked: For Good’ press tour gave Ariana Grande something wicked (it’s Covid)","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the press tour for 'Wicked: For Good,' Ariana Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo demonstrated deep solidarity when both fell ill with COVID-19.

XCX sees your Brat Summer and raises you.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because the pop star is betting she can extend that run with a forthcoming film conceived by and starring her.\n \n\n   \n  A teaser trailer has dropped for “The Moment,” an A24 movie  which Vanity Fair described  as “a revisionist history focused on the aftermath of ‘Brat’s’ release in which she stars with Alexander Skarsgård.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s wild and chaotic — and shows off the singer’s comedic chops, as well as a blink and you miss it glimpse of Kylie Jenner, who makes an appearance.\n \n\n   \n  Charli XCX told Vanity Fair it’s a “2024 period piece.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way, but the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make one,” the singer said. “It’s fiction, but it’s the realest depiction of the music industry that I’ve ever seen.”\n \n\n   \n  Written by Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes and directed by Zamari, it all began in 2024 when Charli XCX was in the middle of co-headlining the “Sweat” tour with fellow singer Troye Sivan and right before she launched her “Brat” tour.\n \n\n   \n  She sent a note to Zamari, who had directed her “Guess” and “360” videos, which he described as “word vomit.”\n \n\n   \n  “It almost felt like a diary entry of, ‘This is how I feel right now,’” Zamiri said. “This feeling of having just almost got everything she could have wanted, and what that felt like on kind of a human level.”\n \n\n   \n  Thus the script was born.\n \n\n   \n  “Brat” became a cultural phenomena,  spurring not only a color obsession , but also being designated  the word of the year for 2024 by Collins Dictionary  which defined it as a person who is “characterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “Brat Summer” was even  embraced by then presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris , which nearly killed the meme and the vibes.\n \n\n   \n  The film’s cast also includes Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Jamie Demetriou, Trew Mullen, Isaac Cole Powell, Rachel Sennott, and Rish Shah.\n \n\n   \n  “The Moment” hits theaters January 26, 2026.\n

What to know, according to a doctor \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A health condition many people have never heard of has become one of the most common liver diseases in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, often develops quietly, so many people do not realize they have it until it is more advanced and signs show up in blood tests or ultrasounds. Even then, the disease can be hard to detect.\n \n\n   \n  What  is MASLD, and why is it becoming so common? How is it diagnosed if most  people do not notice the symptoms? Who is most at risk? Can the  condition be slowed or reversed, and what treatments exist? And what  steps can people take now to protect their liver health?\n \n\n   \n  To  guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr.  Leana Wen. She is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor  at George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s  health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, or   MASLD, and why is it becoming so common? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  MASLD happens when too much fat builds up in the liver of people who often have underlying metabolic problems, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is not caused by heavy alcohol use. In the past, MASLD was called  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , and people may still hear of the condition being referred to by this name or its abbreviation, NAFLD.\n \n\n   \n  Experts now consider MASLD to be the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. It affects 30% to 40% of the adult population globally, including approximately 60% to 70% of people with type 2 diabetes and 70% to 80% of people with obesity, and roughly 1 in 3 adults in the United States, according to a  recent review in JAMA . As rates of obesity and diabetes have risen, MASLD has increased along with them.\n \n\n   \n  Most people with MASLD will not see their illness progress to severe liver disease, but a significant proportion will develop inflammation, scarring, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer over many years. The condition has already become a leading reason for liver transplantation in certain populations groups.  Moreover, this disease is closely associated with other consequences of diabetes and obesity, such as heart disease, stroke and certain cancers, so MASLD is a signal that the whole body is under metabolic strain, not just the liver.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there specific symptoms people should watch for? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Most people with MASLD have no symptoms in the early stages, which is why it often goes undiagnosed. Some may feel more tired than usual or notice vague discomfort or a feeling of fullness on the upper right side of the abdomen, but these signs are nonspecific and easy to overlook.\n \n\n   \n  As  liver damage progresses to more advanced scarring or liver failure,  symptoms become more obvious. They can include yellowing of the skin or  eyes, dark urine, swelling in the legs or abdomen, easy bruising,  confusion or severe fatigue. At that point, the liver disease is already  advanced, which is why it’s important to diagnose the condition long  before these symptoms appear.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is MASLD diagnosed if most people do not notice symptoms?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen :  In many cases, doctors first suspect MASLD when routine blood tests  show mildly abnormal liver enzymes or when an imaging study done for  another reason, such as an abdominal ultrasound, shows that the liver  looks “fatty.” Because most people don’t have symptoms, the diagnosis  depends on health care providers putting together these clues and  checking for metabolic risk factors — namely excess weight, diabetes or  prediabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n \n\n   \n  Once  physicians identify fat in the liver and rule out other causes, such as  viral hepatitis or heavy alcohol use, they check for any liver damage  or scarring. They may order specialized imaging, and in certain  circumstances, a liver biopsy may be performed. One of the key messages  from the JAMA article is that primary care clinicians caring for people  with metabolic risk factors should be thinking about liver health and  consider screening with noninvasive tools, rather than waiting until  symptoms develop.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Who is most at risk for MASLD? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  It’s  most often seen in adults who have metabolic risk factors. While  obesity is a major risk factor, the condition doesn’t only affect people  who appear overweight. Smaller “metabolically unhealthy” individuals  also can develop MASLD.\n \n\n   \n  Older  age is another risk factor, with incidence higher among those 50 and  above, though the condition also can affect children: Close to 10% of  children ages 2 to 19 have MASLD, according to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, the condition is most prevalent among Hispanic people, followed by non-Hispanic Whites and Asian Americans and less common among non-Hispanic Black individuals, the federal agency notes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Can MASLD be slowed or reversed, and what treatments exist? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The good news is that in many people, MASLD can be improved or even reversed, especially if it is caught early.\n \n\n   \n  Weight  loss is the cornerstone of treatment and can significantly reduce liver  fat and inflammation. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking  most days of the week, also helps improve insulin sensitivity and reduce  liver fat.\n \n\n   \n  Until recently, there were no medications specifically approved for MASLD. That is beginning to change. The US Food and Drug Administration has  approved two drugs  for MASH (metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis), the more advanced form of MASLD that includes liver inflammation and scarring. These two medicines, Rezdiffra (resmetirom) and Wegovy (semaglutide), are meant to be used along with, not instead of, lifestyle changes. There is still no drug that can fully “cure” MASLD, so diagnosing early and preventing progression remain crucial.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What steps can people take now to protect their liver health? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  For  most people, protecting the liver from MASLD is the same as protecting  overall metabolic health. Maintaining or working toward a healthy  weight, being physically active, and eating a  healthy diet  with lean proteins, whole grains and vegetables, as well as one that is low in  added sugars  and  ultraprocessed foods , all help.\n \n\n   \n  If you have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol, it is important to work with your clinician to control these conditions. Ask specifically whether your liver health has been checked. Simple blood tests can identify people who might benefit from further evaluation. And consider  other steps  to improve liver health, including avoiding excessive alcohol intake and staying up-to-date on hepatitis vaccines that protect the liver.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/sport/football-nfl-kickoffs-chiefs-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:57:00-05:00","title":"President Trump ‘doesn’t even know what he’s looking at’ on NFL kickoffs, says Chiefs assistant","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump criticized the NFL's dynamic kickoff rule, calling it unsafe and damaging to the game's pageantry, despite league claims that it enhances safety and excitement.

Senior citizens will pay a lot more for Medicare in 2026 \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:45 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senior citizens are the latest group of Americans to face steep increases in their health insurance premiums for 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Part B premiums will jump nearly 10% next year, the largest increase in  four years  and second-largest hike, in dollar terms, in the program’s history. The standard monthly premium will be $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from this year, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That will eat up nearly one-third of the $56 monthly  Social Security cost-of-living adjustment  that retirees will receive in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The steep increase in premiums for Medicare Part B — which covers doctors’ visits, outpatient hospital services, medical equipment and drugs administered by physicians, among other services — comes at a time when health insurance premiums are rising sharply for those with  job-based coverage  and  Affordable Care Act policies.  This upward trend puts more pressure on Americans already struggling with affordability as the prices of  food ,  utilities  and other necessities remain stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “In a world in which people are concerned about the affordability of health care and all other needs, it’s pretty distressing that this increase is so large,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at The Century Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Increasing medical and pharmaceutical costs, as well as usage, are common drivers of the rise in health care premiums across coverage types.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare is also contending with the continuing wave of baby boomers becoming eligible to enroll, plus the ongoing shift toward surgeries and other medical services being performed at outpatient facilities, rather than in hospitals, where care is covered by Medicare Part A, said Rachel Schmidt, research professor at Georgetown University’s Medicare Policy Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  CMS noted that monthly premiums would have risen by another $11 had it not approved a change in payment for skin substitutes that the agency says will reduce spending by nearly 90% on the wound care products. Medicare shelled out more than $10 billion for these products last year, up from $256 million in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Medicare Part D prescription drug policies, which are offered by insurers, will see fewer changes for 2026 than they did for this year. The Biden administration had to rush last fall to stand up a  multibillion-dollar subsidy program  for insurers to prevent steep premium increases stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act. The law, which the Democrat-led Congress approved in 2022, required insurers to be on the hook for more of the drug costs once enrollees hit the catastrophic coverage phase above  a $2,000 cap .\n \n\n   \n  The number of plans being offered for 2026 will decrease modestly, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which noted that Elevance is exiting the market. Many insurers are hiking their premiums by as much as $50 for next year, though some are lowering them or holding them steady.\n \n\n   \n  “If seniors in the standalone PDP market are willing to shop, there is still stability,” said Brooks Conway, a principal at Oliver Wyman.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 69 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, which also covers people with disabilities. The annual open enrollment period ends December 7.\n \n\n   \n    Medicare Advantage market retrenches\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Advantage, which covers just over half of Medicare beneficiaries, is going through a second year of  major changes . The overhaul is being spurred by medical costs outpacing reimbursements from the federal government, which pays insurers to offer coverage to Medicare enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  Many enrollees will have to search for new coverage for 2026 since the number of offerings is tumbling 10% to 3,373 plans, according to Oliver Wyman. Major insurers, including CVS Aetna, Elevance, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, are reducing their plan options in at least 100 counties. The changes are expected to affect just over 2 million people.\n \n\n   \n  (These figures do not include special needs plans that cater to enrollees with chronic conditions or those who are dually eligible for Medicaid. These plans will have more offerings for 2026 than they did this year.)\n \n\n   \n  In certain counties, there will be fewer policies offered with $0 premiums and fewer PPO plans, which have wider provider networks, said Greg Berger, a partner at Oliver Wyman. Insurers are primarily seeking to exit or scale back their less profitable products and geographic areas.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of MAPD plans are trying not to grow,” Berger said, referring to Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage.\n \n\n   \n  And for the first time, some Americans will have no Medicare Advantage plans to choose from. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont and UnitedHealthcare decided to discontinue their coverage in the Green Mountain State, leaving traditional Medicare as the only option for residents in eight counties.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even with the pullbacks, most Medicare beneficiaries will have an array of options in 2026 — 39 plans, on average, down from 42 plans this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to a broad range of affordable coverage options in 2026,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, CMS’ administrator, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Also, fewer plans will offer $0 deductibles for prescription drugs, while maximum out-of-pocket limits for medical care are rising $490, or about 10%, on average. Among Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage that have a monthly premium, the average premium will increase to $66 next year, up from $60 this year.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the supplemental benefits that Medicare Advantage offers enrollees, such as funds for over-the-counter medicines, dental care and vision services, are getting skimpier. The dental allowance, for instance, is declining 10% to $2,107, on average, Berger said.\n \n\n   \n  The current disruptions in the market, however, don’t mean that Medicare Advantage will continue to shrink. Over the longer term, the program is still an attractive market for insurers, Schmidt said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not going away any time soon,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/trump-epstein-mamdani-democrats-feud-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:33:00-05:00","title":"After high-profile missteps, Trump seizes on a new feud and a new potential adversary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a string of political missteps related to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and economic messaging, President Donald Trump escalates tensions with Democrats by issuing an inflammatory social media post calling on lawmakers to face 'sedition' and death, citing a video in which military veterans assert they do not have to obey illegal orders.

potential adversary \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:33 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Whenever Donald Trump is in political trouble, he seeks a fight and a foil.\n \n\n   \n  He will get both on Friday after one of the most misjudged weeks of his two presidencies, after his own choices eroded his political authority over  the Jeffrey Epstein scandal .\n \n\n   \n  Trump is embroiled in a  bitter new feud with Democrats  over national security, provocative rhetoric and presidential power that he  deliberately turned nuclear . And at a White House meeting Friday, he’ll go head-to-head with the next mayor of New York,  Zohran Mamdani , a democratic socialist he’s planning to brand as the unacceptable “communist” face of the Democratic Party next year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political touch deserted him in recent days. He’s heard speculation about whether his decadelong grip on the GOP base is slipping. His missteps amplified the big question over Epstein — why is he so desperate to stop the evidence coming out? And his attempt to empathize with voters over the cost of living  became a farce  when he accused Democrats of stealing the world “affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  So you just knew the president, who has gotten  more irascible by the day , would look for an opening.\n \n\n   \n  And he found it, taking the chance to ignite the kind of political storm that obliterates everything in its path, drags his outraged foes onto his preferred political ground, rallies conservative media and solidifies his base.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tried to seize back the initiative — in the inflammatory way that only he can — in a post of social media posts and reposts that culminated by a warning that a group of Democratic lawmakers were guilty of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  His fury was provoked by a video from lawmakers who — unlike the commander in chief — were veterans of the military or intelligence services reminding members of the armed services that they  do not have to obey any illegal orders .\n \n\n   \n    ‘Never in a million years …’\n \n\n   \n  By any objective measure, Trump’s response was inflammatory and disproportionate in the country’s current climate of political violence. After all, this was a president of the United States ostensibly calling for the prosecution and possible execution of members of Congress. That’s not just an affront to decency and presidential decorum; it’s an assault on the foundations of constitutional, republican government and the separation of powers.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s dangerous. Republicans accused Democrats of inciting violence after two assassination attempts against Trump and the killing of conservative icon Charlie Kirk. It’s hard to see how this is any different. The president’s comments also contrasted with the conciliatory tone of one of his erstwhile political friends, MAGA icon  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia , who apologized Sunday on CNN for her role in “toxic politics.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the Democrats who appears in the video expressed her shock.\n \n\n   \n  “I never in a million years, thought I’d be talking to you tonight about the fact that the president of the United States has called for my death by hanging for sedition and treason. And called for it because I and a number of other people published a video that says you have to follow the law,” Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, loves these kinds of fights.\n \n\n   \n  By any normal political standards, they’d be potential career enders for a top political figure. But Trump uses them, as he did Thursday, to get Democrats to make arguments in defense of institutions, the Constitution, civility and traditional presidential behavior. Their points are often well made. But they can often seem esoteric and off-topic to voters far from Washington who are more concerned with economic security or the cost of health care. In recent elections, Democratic warnings about Trump fracturing norms and legal constraints and threatening the “soul” of the nation haven’t always worked.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the controversies whip up Trump’s conservative media cheerleaders and activists and sets up a loyalty test for Republicans wary of breaking with him.\n \n\n   \n  The country has seen it all before, multiple times: In Trump’s racist “birther” campaign against President Barack Obama; in his mockery of the late Sen. John McCain’s war record; in his false claims that he won the 2020 election. It’s a technique that has often worked for Trump. He might alienate half the country, but it’s one of the keys to his staunch support from his GOP base and his capacity to always portray himself as an anti-establishment scourge and an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  One question now, however, amid some of his worst-ever approval ratings and struggles with the economy, is whether Trump’s antics may begin to disgust even some voters who have always stood by him.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans face familiar political dodgeball\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s bombshell was typical of the distraction tactics that Trump has always used and that some of his critics have sometimes accused the news media of repeatedly falling for. Yet Trump’s “distraction” gambits are often so unhinged or threatening to basic American values that it’s inevitable that they create huge shock and fierce debate. They require pushback from his opponents, even if it dilutes their messages.\n \n\n   \n  As usual, Trump’s detonation of a new controversy forced Republicans on Capitol Hill to dance on the head of a political pin, with some deploying the classic excuse that they hadn’t read the posts.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson gingerly tried to separate himself from the president’s comments, saying the words “are not the ones that I would use.” He told CNN’s Manu Raju that “obviously, I don’t think that this is… these are crimes punishable by death or any of that.”\n \n\n   \n  Another close Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said the president’s comments were “over the top.” And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has questioned the legality of administration attacks on alleged drug-trafficker boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, said he didn’t think it was a “good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked whether the president really wanted the execution of members of Congress. She replied: “No.” But true to Trump’s lifetime mantra, she counterattacked, sketching an argument other Republicans adopted that the video was an attempt to get members of the armed forces to disobey the commander in chief.\n \n\n   \n  This is a misrepresentation. But it created sufficient political heat to blur reality while making the president’s out-of-bounds outburst seem just like one side of a political back-and-forth. Johnson, for instance, said that what the legislators did was “unprecedented in American history, and it should be called out, and that’s what the president has expressed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some might question why the Democrats chose to make their video — and to give the president an opportunity to change the subject after he’s spent days flailing over the Epstein matter and the cost of living. And any political move involving the military risks creating a drama that leaves servicemembers in the middle of a partisan firestorm.\n \n\n   \n  A counterargument would be that there is deep concern among many lawmakers — one that is especially acute for combat veterans — that Trump will ask service members to undertake unlawful attacks and missions. This is not hypothetical.  As CNN’s Aaron Blake reported , there have been many occasions when Trump’s foreign policy or military ventures have raised questions of legality.\n \n\n   \n  Judges have often ruled that administration policies infringed the law. Trump has sent troops into American cities on questionable grounds. His actions near Venezuela have many on Capitol Hill fearing an illegal war. And his threats of retribution need to be taken seriously since he’s turned the Justice Department into his engine of personal retribution.\n \n\n   \n  And after all, the Democrats in the video were only restating a principle that every servicemember understands — even if the question of deciding whether an order is a legal or not can be fraught and imprecise during the fog of war.\n \n\n   \n    High-stakes White House showdown looms\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s meeting with Mamdani at the White House on Friday is high stakes for both men.\n \n\n   \n  Both are New Yorkers; both won power through populist politics. Each harnessed a political moment and won power against insider, establishment elites.\n \n\n   \n  But while presidential power dwarfs that of a mere mayor-to-be, some comparisons may also be unflattering to Trump, who at 79 is closer to the end of his political career than the 34-year-old Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made his intentions clear with Mamdani. He’s setting up the mayor-elect as a political foil and a symbol of all Democrats to try to dispute their party’s more mainstream credentials ahead of the midterm elections next year. “Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting,” Trump said on his Truth Social network on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The president threatened during the mayoral campaign to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won because “as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Mamdani is not a communist, and anyone who understands the deprivations and tyranny of communist rule in the Soviet Union and elsewhere would see the comparison as absurd. But he’s been  enthusiastic in his democratic socialism , and Trump will be hoping that his attacks can brand the incoming mayor and his followers nationwide as extreme.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting, if it takes place in the Oval Office, before the cameras, will be a huge test for Mamdani. The president has not hesitated to humiliate some past visitors on television,  most notoriously Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . But Mamdani will also know that some of the president’s ire can sometimes be defused by flattery.\n \n\n   \n  The next mayor of New York City will be keen to show he can stand up to Trump — and to maneuver politically ahead of what could be a year of confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  And any new eruptions by the president, after a week in which he’s looked like he’s racing off the rails, might only further underscore doubts over his political health.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/eric-swalwell-california-governor-race-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:42:00-05:00","title":"Democratic Rep.

Weird \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In popular culture, the archetypal look of a witch is a female figure generally depicted wearing a black dress, robe, or cloak. Typically, she also sports a pointed hat and carries a broomstick that doubles as her mode of transport. It’s an image that was largely solidified by the 1939 film “The Wizard of Oz,” featuring the Wicked Witch of the West, despite a belief in witches and witchcraft that has long existed in many cultures worldwide for centuries.\n \n\n   \n  As “Wicked: For Good,” the sequel to the modern film adaptation directed by Jon M. Chu, releases in cinemas, eagle-eyed viewers may notice a subtle difference in the witchy protagonist, Elphaba, played by Cynthia Erivo. Devotees, fear not: She still has green skin and an all-encompassing uniform of black. However, for the first time, the character wears trousers. Slim fit and very discrete, they’re worn by Elphaba as she appears in the opening scene, swooping down from the sky to thwart the plight of animals, and throughout the film, as she’s on the run from a mob of angry townspeople on a witch hunt.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a style choice, a thematic one,” according to Paul Tazewell, the costume designer for both “Wicked” (for which he  won an Oscar this year ) and “Wicked: For Good.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from his home in Brooklyn, New York, Tazewell — who worked on the costumes for both films simultaneously — recounts Elphaba’s outfits in the first, from the black pinafore she wears as a little girl when she mourns the death of her mother, to the long, tailored coatdress with puffed sleeves seen on her arrival at Shiz University as a reserved young woman. Her whole life, “she’s othered because of the color of her skin,” said Tazewell. “She’s an oddity within the community.” That kind of prejudice is enough to make any introvert become more reticent. Yet, Elphaba doesn’t — a retaliation that is expressed through her clothes, which she “protects and armors” herself with, he added.\n \n\n   \n  As the first film ends, Elphaba is seen parting ways with Glinda, the benevolent good witch played by Ariana Grande, and the decision to introduce trousers was made as her new environment required her to be more agile. “She’s in exile in the forest, so she only has access to certain things. Her dress is in tatters at this point,” said Tazewell. “We moved away from a dress silhouette to one where she can be active and also give more presence.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, while trousers allow Elphaba to move more freely, it is also indicative of her newfound liberation. “It really is about self-expression,” Tazewell continued. “Elphaba has decided that she sees herself as the most important thing, and finding and having a connection to that self-love is her drive. It’s where her power lies.”\n \n\n   \n    A marker of independence\n \n\n   \n  Modern depictions of witches in pop culture range from Roald Dahl’s 1983 book of the same name, which portrayed witches as gruesome creatures without hair or fingernails, to more glamorous or gothic interpretations seen via Maleficent of “Sleeping Beauty” and  the witches of “Suspiria.”  Others, such as “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” Hermione Granger in “Harry Potter,” the sisters in “Charmed,” and Bonnie in “The Vampire Diaries,” appear entirely normal, taking on the guise of an ordinary girl next door.\n \n\n   \n  But Elphaba is different in that she is neither ghastly nor glam. Her impact is more figurative, as she serves as a symbol of empowerment, primarily through her unwavering moral conviction and courage to defy unjust societal expectations. For some experts, there are parallels that can be drawn between Elphaba’s liberation in the new film and the kind women experienced in the mid-19th century when they started entering traditionally male-dominated spaces like the workplace and began wearing trousers more publicly.\n \n\n   \n  One of the earliest iterations were floaty, wide-legged shorts known as “bloomers” — popularized by the early suffragist Amelia Bloomer, they were worn as undergarments and allowed for greater comfort and freedom of movement. The garment’s rise coincided with the adoption of once strictly male activities like riding a bicycle. But, despite its benefits, it “quickly drew ridicule because people thought it was so shocking and distracting from the cause,” said April C. Armstrong, who co-curated a recent exhibition at Princeton University contextualizing  women’s fashion in the 19th and 20th centuries . Bloomers have since become fashionable and are no longer treated as underwear, as seen on  the high fashion runways  and worn by celebrities like  the pop star Dua Lipa .\n \n\n   \n  However, women did not universally start wearing trousers until the 20th century, when Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel started popularizing them in her collections (the designer liked wearing pants herself and  often borrowed them from her male lovers ). Silver screen stars including Katherine Hepburn, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich, who all wore trousers, helped to create its association with a “modern, independent and spirited” woman, said Rhonda Garelick, the founding director of Hofstra’s Institute for Public Humanities and the Arts. “In trousers, women can not only ride a bicycle, but they can play sports; they can walk more quickly; they can get in and out of vehicles,” continued Garelick. “We tend to forget it was much more difficult for women, and to this day, I think a woman wearing trousers is still associated with independence.”\n \n\n   \n    More than meets the eye\n \n\n   \n  When it came to creating the looks for “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good,” Tazewell — whose historic win of the Academy Award’s best costume design made him the first Black man to take home the prize — placed great emphasis on ensuring harmony between the central characters, especially when Elphaba had a greater risk of being overshadowed by Glinda’s more colorful, frothy gowns. And while black is a color that typically struggles to jump off the screen, Elphaba never disappears into the background.\n \n\n   \n  This can be credited to Tazewell’s choice of sumptuous textures and rich fabrics. “When something is light and pink and what we call pretty, it is easier to make that look elevated and glamorous, but with black, elements can get lost,” he said. “What I was relying on is the depth that was created, whether it was in the micro-pleating that created an undulating pattern on her Emerald City dress, or her sweeping trench coat, which is made of a wax cotton that is water repellent” — a significant detail given the belief among the film’s townsfolk that water makes Elphaba melt.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematography was also an important consideration, he added, as “light reflects different textures in different ways.” He explained: “If it’s wool and felted, it will soak in. If it’s pleated, then we catch the depth of the pleats in the way it’s lit. In both films, we used an underlayer of color underneath Elphaba’s sheer black to give a more iridescent quality.”\n \n\n   \n  But, as is typical of Tazewell’s work, there’s always greater meaning beyond the aesthetic. In “Wicked: For Good,” not only has Elphaba adopted trousers as part of her silhouette, but she has “a swaggering presence because she has knee high boots with a slightly higher heel. The brim of her hat becomes a little more extreme,” said Tazewell — symbolizing a refusal to adhere to societal rules and expectations. Elphaba may be ostracized, but that won’t stop her from commanding attention and taking up space. Unlike Glinda, whose delicate dresses nipped in the waist, feel like the opposite of that, as she seeks to maintain her idealized image.\n \n\n   \n  For Tazewell, those nuances are key. “The spark point for me really was when Cynthia was cast as Elphaba,” he said. “It’s fueled by the fact that we have a Black woman playing a role about a woman who is vilified for the color of her skin, and the choices she makes to empower herself, to go towards what she feels is right and true. That speaks of humanity and how we relate to each other.” It may be why the story, which began as a book before being turned into a hit Broadway musical and film, has resonated with so many audiences, he said. “‘Wicked’ is unlike any other American tale that we have. It operates as an allegory for the modern systems that we have — around power, around self-evolution, and also around advocation for animals and the environment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-05:00","title":"Rescuers Continue to Recover Bodies from Rubble, Days After Deadly Russian Attack on Western Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late November 2025, a large-scale Russian airstrike targeted apartment buildings in Ternopil, western Ukraine, killing at least 31 people, including several children.

people were still missing after the airstrikes on two apartment blocks in the western city of Ternopil. On Friday, three more bodies were recovered, including those of two children. Ukraine’s interior minister said the strikes may have wiped out entire families.\n \n\n   \n  The large-scale Russian attack overnight Tuesday was one of the deadliest to target western Ukraine since the start of the conflict and prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets over neighboring Poland and Romania.\n \n\n   \n  Russia “will never stop on its own,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram, urging allies to increase pressure on Moscow to halt the violence and restore peace.\n \n\n   \n  Oksana Kobel’s son was in a ninth-story apartment in the building at the time of the attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to work, heard the explosions.

Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Poland’s Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track.

the forced Epstein files vote is emboldening some Republicans to go it alone \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson may want to put the Jeffrey Epstein saga behind him, but some Republicans saw rank-and-file members’ success in forcing Tuesday’s vote as an opportunity to push their own legislative priorities to the floor — even if it doesn’t have leadership’s blessing.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has put House Republican leaders on notice that unless they change their approach to a bipartisan bill banning lawmaker stock trading, she will circumvent them using a discharge petition and force a vote herself.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent interview in her office, the Florida Republican told CNN the overwhelming support from lawmakers to release the Jeffrey Epstein files should encourage more members to take advantage of the leadership-bucking tool that made the vote possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think more members need to use it,” Luna said. “More members need to get outside of this mentality that you have to go and ask for permission from leadership to bring legislation. That’s not why you’re here. And that defeats the purpose of why you call yourself a representative. If you want to be a follower, call yourself a follower of Congress, but not a representative of Congress if you’re not doing your job.”\n \n\n   \n  Typically, the majority party’s leadership team dictates floor activity, setting the calendar for which bills are brought and when.\n \n\n   \n  Discharge petitions face many procedural hurdles (to start, it requires 218 signatures — a majority of all 435 members, rather than a majority of members present) and rarely lead to an actual vote.\n \n\n   \n  It’s even more unusual for a member to deploy the tactic when their own party is in power. But in a fractured Washington with razor-thin margins in the House, there are signs lawmakers may consider the strategy more seriously.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Don Bacon recently signed onto a discharge petition to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers after President Donald Trump  signed  an executive order ending the practice. That petition just clinched the necessary 218 signatures needed to move forward toward a vote on the House floor. And this week, Bacon told CNN he is preparing to help launch another petition that would push for more aid to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I respect the speaker and the majority leader drive the agenda. But the discharge petition process enables us to push member-driven initiatives to the floor for a vote,” Bacon said.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who also signed onto the workers’ rights petition, said “it’s is certainly being viewed by members individuals as a tool in their disposal.” Still, he said, their use is “still very limited and it really depends on the issue.”\n \n\n   \n  This year alone, lawmakers have brought 10 discharge petitions, with the Epstein files push standing as the most notable. Last Congress, under Republican control, 20 discharge petitions were filed, after 18 the Congress before. By contrast in the 116th Congress, from 2019-2020, only 5 such attempts were made. Only a handful became law.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had long tried to block the Epstein discharge petition from coming to the floor and strongly criticized the use of the tool to force a vote, even though he ultimately supported the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Discharge petitions are never a good idea. In the House, it is a tool of the minority party, not the majority,” Johnson said in July.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Acknowledging Johnson’s argument, Luna said, “A discharge petition is simply a legislative tool where we actually can collect signatures to bring something to the floor. It’s kind of an old school way of legislating.”\n \n\n   \n  And the tool has helped her clinch legislative wins. The congresswoman’s threat of bringing a discharge petition helped her  reach an agreement  with Johnson in their standoff over proxy voting for new parents, an issue that had paralyzed the House.\n \n\n   \n  “I will protect the discharge petition with every bone in my body,” Luna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    New push to ban stock trading\n \n\n   \n  Now, Luna is prepared to use the same strategy to ensure the bipartisan push to ban stock trading of lawmakers, their spouses and their dependent children becomes law as pressure has escalated for elected officials to weed out corruption and restore public trust in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long-traded stocks and seeking a ban has been a yearslong pursuit. But Luna says that she is running into new roadblocks that are clouding the process.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of taking up the bipartisan bill that has 95 cosponsors, Luna said she has been informed that leadership wants to pursue their own bill and that members would not be allowed to add their own amendments.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just not feeling that this has been an open and honest process,” Luna said. “And so, I will make that decision collectivity with the other members who signed on.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Luna said that House Speaker Mike Johnson has been understanding throughout this process, but she is giving leadership until Friday to address the issue with her.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, I understand that he also has to manage other people and there’s a lot of personalities,” Luna said of Johnson. “This is not a popular topic on the Hill. In fact, it’s made me very unpopular within the House of Representatives but very popular among the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Even with the Friday deadline, Luna says her discharge petition is ready to go.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s filed, so it means it’s baked, so I can call it up whenever. And that’s the element of surprise that we like to keep people on our toes. So it’s ready to go,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/transgender-cancer-registries-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-05:00","title":"US cancer registries, constrained by Trump policies, to recognize only ‘male’ or ‘female’ patients","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Under policies initiated by the Trump administration, U.S. cancer registries funded by the CDC and National Cancer Institute will be required to classify patients' sex as only male, female, or unknown, beginning in 2026.

recognize only ‘male’ or ‘female’ patients \n       \n  By Rachana Pradhan, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.\n \n\n   \n  The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute  will categorize cancer patients  as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.\n \n\n   \n  Registries  currently specify  whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump in January issued an  executive order  stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.\n \n\n   \n  “In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.\n \n\n   \n    Missing the big picture\n \n\n   \n  Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n  For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents  97% of the U.S. population . The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering  nearly half  the U.S. population.\n \n\n   \n  The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.\n \n\n   \n  For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying  rising rates of colorectal cancer  among people  younger than 50 . As a result, U.S. guidelines  now recommend  that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.\n \n\n   \n  States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women.  The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas  initiated a statewide effort  aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”\n \n\n   \n  The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.\n \n\n   \n  For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.\n \n\n   \n  The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Backwards’ progress\n \n\n   \n  NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.\n \n\n   \n  According to an  analysis of CDC data  by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.\n \n\n   \n  “Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.\n \n\n   \n  A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were  two to three times  as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.\n \n\n   \n  A  Canadian study  concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a  2023 study  from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.\n \n\n   \n  Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.\n \n\n   \n  Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and  stopping specialized services  for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.\n \n\n   \n  Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”\n \n\n   \n   KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at  KFF  — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/world/jd-vance-wife-india-religion-debate-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:39:00-05:00","title":"JD Vance Expresses Hope His Hindu Wife Will Become a Christian, Stirring Feathers in India","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Vice President JD Vance sparked international backlash after expressing hope that his Hindu wife, Usha Vance, would one day be moved by the Christian Gospel, a comment that resonated deeply in India and among the Indian diaspora.

The controversy is further framed within the context of political strategy, as Vance’s comments are seen as potentially aimed at wooing conservative and MAGA-aligned audiences ahead of the 2028 election. While Vance defends his remarks as rooted in personal faith and free will, critics view them as undermining religious freedom and pluralism, challenging the democratic values of both the U.S. and India.","keyTakeAways":["JD Vance expressed hope that his Hindu wife, Usha Vance, would one day be moved by the Christian Gospel, which stirred significant backlash in India and among the Indian diaspora.","Usha Vance, of Indian descent and raised in a Hindu household, affirmed her non-conversion to Christianity and emphasized that her family's Hindu traditions, including daily prayers and temple visits, remain central to her identity.","The comments were seen as denigrating to Hinduism, especially in the context of India’s colonial history of Christian proselytization and rising religious tensions under the BJP government.","Critics argue that Vance’s remarks reflect a broader American cultural trend privileging Christianity, contradicting democratic values of religious pluralism and freedom of belief.","Some in India and among the diaspora view Usha Vance’s presence in a high-level U.S. position as a symbol of progress for Indian diaspora leadership and cultural pride.","Despite Vance’s defense that he respects free will and supports his wife’s choice, critics see the comments as conditional on conversion, undermining interfaith family integrity and religious autonomy.","The controversy underscores a political tension between promoting religious identity in American politics and upholding international norms of religious tolerance, especially in democracies like India and the United States."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"JD Vance","whatIsThisEntity":"U.S. Vice President and member of the Republican Party;

That’s ruffled feathers in India \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, Matthew Rehbein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:39 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When JD Vance told a stadium of thousands he hoped his wife would one day be moved “by the Christian gospel” the same way he was, he inadvertently stepped into a contentious dialogue in India and among the diaspora about religious freedom and, for some, evoked memories of the country’s complicated past with Christian proselytizing.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at an event last month with Turning Point USA at the University of Mississippi, Vance was asked by an audience member about Christianity and American patriotism.\n \n\n   \n  “Why are we making Christianity one of the major things that you have to have in common to be one of you guys? To show that I love America just as much as you do?” the audience member asked.\n \n\n   \n  In an assertive and lengthy response that began on immigration, Vance then discussed his interfaith marriage: “My wife did not grow up Christian. I think it’s fair to say she grew up in a Hindu family but not in a particularly religious family.”\n \n\n   \n  Raised in an evangelical family, Vance converted  to Catholicism in 2019.  His wife,  Usha Vance , who grew up in Southern California and is of Indian descent, was raised in a Hindu household.\n \n\n   \n  “Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church? I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,” Vance went on to say.\n \n\n   \n  As the debate around those comments began to swell online among some Indians and the Indian diaspora, Vance responded to a since-deleted comment  on X , writing that “like many people in an interfaith marriage,” he hopes his wife may see things as he does one day, but would continue to support her regardless.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on October 30 at the Turning Point USA event honoring his longtime friend and late conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, Vance explained that he and his wife were “agnostic or atheist” when they met.\n \n\n   \n  “We decided to raise our kids Christian,” the vice president said, adding that the couple’s 8-year-old son, Vivek, had his first communion a year ago –– a remark that drew thunderous applause.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance talked about navigating raising children in an interfaith marriage during an  interview  with Meghan McCain in June, noting she and her husband had several conversations about it during his conversion to Catholicism.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not Catholic and I’m not intending to convert or anything like that,” Usha Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that while their children attend Catholic school, “they can choose whether they want to be baptized Catholic.” They are also exposed to the Hindu faith and traditions through her family, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My grandmother is a particularly devout Hindu. She prays every day. She goes to the temple regularly. She’ll do her own pujas (prayer rituals).”\n \n\n   \n  During the event last month, the vice president said, “One of the most important Christian principles is that you respect free will … You figure this stuff out as a family, and you trust in God to have a plan, and you try to follow it as best as you can.”\n \n\n   \n  But, despite Vance’s invocation of free will, his remarks struck a nerve –– some described the vice president’s words as denigrating towards Hindus –– and broadly, South Asians –– at a time of rising hostilities towards immigrants in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ridiculous and absolutely wrong,” 25-year-old Kush Mehta of Mumbai told CNN of Vance’s comments expressing his hope his wife would convert. “I’m in favor of everyone having their own identity, their own values, and their own spiritual path. No one should be forced or pressured into any religion.”\n \n\n   \n  “Vance felt compelled to declare that his wife was indeed raised Hindu, but not that Hindu,” CNN affiliate CNN-News18 editor Shubhangi Sharma wrote in an  opinion column . “In a political climate so charged against Indian immigrants, this is not just personal. It’s political. It’s a presidential call to convert.”\n \n\n   \n  “When an elected leader treats his faith as the ultimate ideal for everyone, including his wife, it ceases to be personal,” Areena Arora, a journalist with  The Hindu , wrote in an opinion piece, noting at the time of his baptism six years ago, Vance told  The American Conservative : “My views on public policy and what the optimal state should look like are pretty aligned with Catholic social teaching.”\n \n\n   \n    A reminder of India’s colonial past\n \n\n   \n  For some, Vance’s comments were a reminder of India’s painful past, where the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century heralded Christian proselytization, prejudice and, at times, forced conversions - particularly under British colonial rule.\n \n\n   \n  “The belief that the Christian religion must shape public order is the same civilisational justification that fuelled Europe’s conquest of the world,” Arora, a journalist with The Hindu, wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the differences between how Hindus and Christians think of religion, and because of the colonial history of Christian evangelizing, many Hindus today still think of Christianity as a kind of undigestible ‘foreign faith,’” said Chad Bauman, a professor of religious studies at Butler University in Indiana whose research focuses on the interactions and conflicts between Hindus and Christians.\n \n\n   \n  “This view is particularly common among the supporters of the party currently in charge,” Bauman added, referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its brand of Hindu Nationalism.\n \n\n   \n  India has seen recurring ethnic and religious clashes for centuries – but tensions have surged in recent decades amid a rise in violence against the Christian and Muslim minorities and, most notably, since the BJP came to power in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  India’s constitution guarantees freedom of religion, although some critics argue that religious freedoms have been eroded under the BJP at the expense of non-Hindu minorities. The issue of changing religion remains deeply controversial, and multiple states have put in place laws restricting religious conversions for all faiths.\n \n\n   \n  Bauman said Vance’s remarks also confirmed a common stereotype many Hindus have of religion in Trump’s America: “America is not a nation of religious tolerance and pluralism but rather one that privileges Christianity over all other religions.”\n \n\n   \n  Several social media users described Vance’s comments as contrary to American values.\n \n\n   \n  One  X  user criticized Vance for what they viewed as him casting Usha’s Hindu faith as a “problem to be fixed,” writing: “This isn’t American values; it’s weak leadership & poor politics, bending to MAGA pressure, not defending her dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  Another user wrote on  X : “When JD Vance had hit his lowest, it was his ‘Hindu’ wife and her Hindu upbringing that had helped him navigate through the tough times. Today in a position of power, her religion has become a liability. What a fall.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘She has to stick to her roots’\n \n\n   \n  For some in India, Usha Vance’s position in the administration as a woman of Hindu faith has become a point of pride.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s amazing … to see someone with Indian roots and a Hindu background in such a visible, powerful space in the US. It shows how far the community has come and how diverse leadership is becoming,” said Mehta of Mumbai.\n \n\n   \n  If the second lady does convert, “It would create a lot of backlash from people who are very staunch in their beliefs,” said Vanessa Almeida, a business owner in Goa.\n \n\n   \n  “She has to stick to her roots as much as possible,” Almeida said. “That’s what the community has been hoping for.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the vice president and second lady’s offices.\n \n\n   \n  Vance was quick to defend himself on social media against backlash, writing in the  X post  that the criticism wreaked “of anti-Christian bigotry.”\n \n\n   \n  “She is not Christian and has no plans to convert,” Vance clarified, adding that Usha Vance encouraged him to “reengage” with his faith many years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “But like many people in an interfaith marriage –– or any interfaith relationship –– I hope she may one day see things as I do,” he goes on to say. “Regardless, I’ll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she’s my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is completely in contrast to Vance’s previous comments that his wife’s Hindu upbringing and values inspired his own return to faith,” Priyanka Deo, US correspondent of Indian network NDTV, said on  Instagram , adding that his latest remarks suggest acceptance in the United States is conditional and predicated upon becoming a Christian.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, who converted to Catholicism while already married, has said his wife encouraged him to explore his faith and that his family influenced him in the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember when I started to reengage with my own faith, Usha was very supportive,” Vance said during an interview with  Fox News  in June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  During the same interview, Usha Vance said she supported her husband’s decision for a few reasons, including seeing the power of her parents’ faith. “That was one of the things that made them such good parents. That made them, really, very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  “I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Wooing the Republican base?\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s comments come ahead of the 2028 election. Trump, in August, suggested Vance was “most likely” the heir apparent to the  Make America Great Again movement  –– the furthest he’s gone in backing Vance as a future presidential candidate.\n \n\n   \n  Vance also told Fox News recently he plans to talk to Trump about potentially running after the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Ram Puniyani, a Mumbai-based writer and critic of Hindu fundamentalism, said he thinks Vance’s comments trample on freedom of religion –– an essential tenant of any democratic society, be it the United States or India, which is still widely regarded as the world’s largest democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that America’s civic society had much more liberal attitudes earlier, but those attitudes are getting rigid, and this is not a healthy thing for the growth of democracy worldwide,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance has not spoken out about her husband’s comments, though some have jumped quickly to her defense.\n \n\n   \n  “No one has been harsher on JD Vance’s policy than I have,” wrote California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who is also Hindu,  on X.  “But his wife is an accomplished daughter of immigrants, and they have young kids. Attack on the policies. Leave his family out of it.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to others who have called Usha Vance a threat to the “MAGA base,” McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, said the second lady was a “huge asset” to the Republican party, someone who bridged party and political lines and “brought warmth” to the vice president.\n \n\n   \n  “She is among other things a modern mother and a style icon,”  McCain wrote on X . “She’s personally my favorite person in the Trump administration.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/americas/canadian-man-loses-legal-battle-to-keep-his-secret-million-dollar-stash","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:45:00-05:00","title":"Canadian man loses legal battle to keep his secret million-dollar stash","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marcel Breton, a Canadian man, lost a 16-year legal battle to keep over 1.2 million Canadian dollars he had hidden in unusual locations on his property in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

battle to keep his secret million-dollar stash \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:45 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Canadian man has lost his 16-year legal battle to get back more than 1.2 million Canadian dollars he had stored in bizarre locations around his home.\n \n\n   \n  On December 1, 2009, police visited Marcel Breton’s rural property on the outskirts of Thunder Bay, a city in northwest Ontario, looking for an illegal handgun,  according to court documents. \n \n\n   \n  There, they made an unusual discovery: 15,000 Canadian dollars’ worth of bills in the floor heating ducts of the living room, about 32,000 dollars stored in locations around the garage, and over 1.2 million worth of Canadian bills in a rubber tub buried in the ground under the garage.\n \n\n   \n  All up, the stash was worth 1.19 million US dollars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  Police also found a variety of drugs, including cocaine, marijuana and ecstasy, and told Canadian media at the time that they were “flabbergasted.”\n \n\n   \n  Breton was charged with various offences, including possession of the proceeds of crime, and was initially convicted. But in a retrial, he successfully argued the search of his property wasn’t lawful, and he was acquitted.\n \n\n   \n  But then came the matter of what to do with all of the money.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, an Ontario appeals court upheld a 2023 ruling that decided the lion’s share of the money should go to the government.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court noted the trial judge, Justice Bruce Fitzpatrick, remarked that it was “unusual for an average person to have such a large amount of money buried in tubs underneath their property.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted that the most common type of bill found in the bundles was 20 Canadian dollars, which is the most common denomination associated with the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, Breton had not reported any income to the Canada Revenue Agency between 2001 and 2008, the documents said.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also did not buy Breton’s justifications for why he had so much cash – that he had won it in a lottery or casino, or had earned it from his vehicle repair business.\n \n\n   \n  The trial judge then ordered that most of the money be handed over to the government, a decision the appeals court affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Sanaa Ahmed, assistant professor of law at the University of Calgary, said the case is an example of “legalistic hair-splitting.”\n \n\n   \n  “Confronted with facts such as these, courts will often find ways to justify confiscating monies and thus ‘punishing’ the accused, even though they may have been acquitted otherwise,” she told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, as societies, we’re growing increasingly comfortable with breaking some rules to catch the so-called ‘bad guys,’” Ahmed added. “But we forget that we made those rules precisely to avoid subjective, normative judgements by those who found themselves in judicial office.”\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Gallant, professor of law at the University of Manitoba, said in this case, the onus is on Breton to prove the money was obtained legally, noting “cash is the currency of illegal drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “What legitimate source might underlie dollars stuffed in a barrel and buried?  Why bury it?  Each day, at the very least, you would even bank interest,” Gallant said.\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t all bad news for Breton. The appeals court upheld Fitzpatrick’s prior ruling that Breton gets to keep 15,000 Canadian dollars which was found inside the vents of the home, since the judge couldn’t rule out that that cash had been obtained lawfully. In today’s money, that’s worth just over $10,600.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/alabama-public-libraries-books-transgender-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:42:00-05:00","title":"Alabama Board Votes to Remove Transgender-Related Books from Public Library Youth Sections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Alabama Public Library Service Board voted to remove books discussing transgender identities, gender ideology, and non-binary genders from youth and children's sections of public libraries across the state.

The books must be housed in the adult sections.\n \n\n   \n  Board Chairman John Wahl, who is also chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, called the action “a major step forward in putting parents back in control in what their children are exposed to.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to put Alabama families in charge. We want them to make the decision what is best for their families,” Wahl said.\n \n\n   \n  The state board vote came after a heated public hearing last month. Opponents on Thursday called it an attempt at censorship and the erasure of trans people.\n \n\n   \n  The decision affects more than 200 local libraries and will take effect in 2026 after a required publication period.\n \n\n   \n  The language is being added to existing rules that youth sections must be free of material that is “sexually explicit or other material deemed inappropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  The new language also includes a directive that “all material containing such content must be weeded out of the library’s collection or relocated to an adult section.”\n \n\n   \n  Mack Reynolds held a sign outside the building stating that “positive representation” is not the same as sexually explicit material. He noted that the vote was taking place on Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day that focuses on trans people who have lost their lives because of violence.\n \n\n   \n  Reynolds, who is transgender, said books are the best way for people to learn about people who are different from them.\n \n\n   \n  “What I hope is that other children can approach my daughter with curiosity and compassion. And if they don’t know, then there is so much more room for angst, fear and frustration,” Reynolds said.\n \n\n   \n  The scope of the new rule is not entirely clear. During a public hearing, some proponents had objected to books that teach children about pronouns or describe a child’s experience being transgender. It is less clear if any book with a transgender character would be removed.\n \n\n   \n  “Most of the people of Alabama have not asked for this latest library-fixated assault on the LGBTQ community because it’s their children and children of friends and relatives you’re attacking with this misguided proposal before you,” Jim Vickery told the board during a public comment period.\n \n\n   \n  Board member Amy Minton said most comments that they received during a public comment period were in favor of the change.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what the majority of people of Alabama want,” Minton said.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the proposal said parents who want their children to read the books can get them in other places, including the adult sections of libraries.\n \n\n   \n  Angie Hayden, a co-founder of Read Freely Alabama, said she is concerned the aim is to completely remove the books. She said state regulations do not allow the purchase of books aimed at children if state regulations also deem the book inappropriate for children.\n \n\n   \n  “So long term they are banning these books, slowly removing these books from your public library,” Hayden said.\n \n\n   \n  The board also tightened restrictions on youth library cards, stating that the “standard library card” for minors cannot access books in adult collections. Libraries can issue an all-access card only with the written permission of parents.\n \n\n   \n  Board members also had sharp disagreements over restoring funding to the Fairhope Public Library. The board had moved to withhold funding because of some titles in the teen section.\n \n\n   \n  Board members rejected a proposal to restore funding immediately. Wahl said he wanted to wait until they had reviewed Fairhope’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “John, are you becoming the censor-in-chief for Alabama?” board member Ronald A. Snider asked Wahl.\n \n\n   \n  Snider said the state board is acting like a “board of censorship” when they “second guess” the decisions of professional librarians and local library boards.\n \n\n   \n  “You can call it second-guessing or you can call it accountability,” Wahl replied.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-proposal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:06:00Z","title":"Trump’s 28-Point Peace Proposal for Ukraine Would Require Land Concessions and Military Reduction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A draft 28-point peace proposal from the Trump administration outlines a path to end the war in Ukraine by requiring territorial concessions, including recognition of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as de facto Russian territory, and a reduction in the size of Ukraine’s military to 600,000.

proposal for Ukraine would require land concessions and military reduction \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, Kevin Liptak, Natasha Bertrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:06 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A new  Trump administration plan  for the end of the war in Ukraine would see Kyiv cede territory to Russia, US “de facto” recognition of Crimea and other Ukrainian territory forcibly seized by the Kremlin as Russian, and limits to the size of Ukraine’s military, according to a draft of the plan obtained Thursday by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The draft’s veracity was confirmed to CNN by a US official. Many of the ideas put forward in the 28-point plan have been rejected in previous negotiations by Ukraine and European officials and would be seen as concessions to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  US officials said the plan was still being worked on, and that any final agreement would require concessions from both sides, not just Ukraine. Some of the points being circulated now – including some that appear weighted toward Moscow’s demands – are not final, officials said, and will almost certainly evolve. During a Thursday afternoon briefing, the White House press secretary said the plan remained “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  After meeting a top US military official in Kyiv on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to work with the Trump administration on the new plan, saying in a social media post that he was prepared for “constructive, honest and swift work” to achieve peace.\n \n\n   \n  However, Moscow had not yet been informed that Zelensky was ready to discuss the plan,   a Russian journalist cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying, state media reported Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan, which President Donald Trump has reviewed and supports, is the White House’s latest attempt to bring  Russia’s war in Ukraine  to an end. Some of the proposal’s provisions – including territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia – have previously been nonstarters with the Ukrainians. But US officials see a new window of opportunity to restart peace discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The plan is still in the framework stage, and its many points haven’t been finalized.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the draft plan\n \n\n   \n  Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, the draft describes the plan’s implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “Sanctions will be imposed for violations,” it states.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan would have Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States.” This would mark a stunning reversal of longstanding US policy to acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity and not recognize forcible changes in territory.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan says Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact, “which will mean de facto recognition along the line of contact.”\n \n\n   \n  “Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside the five regions,” it says.\n \n\n   \n  The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan states that Russian forces will not enter the demilitarized zone. The two countries would commit not to change the agreed-upon territorial arrangements by force, or else security guarantees would not apply.\n \n\n   \n  The security guarantees, which the plan says Ukraine will receive, are not detailed in the draft. However, it notes that the US will receive compensation for its guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  If Russia invades Ukraine, “in addition to a decisive coordinated military response, all global sanctions will be reinstated, recognition of the new territory and all other benefits of this deal will be revoked,” the draft states.\n \n\n   \n  “If Ukraine launches a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause, the security guarantee will be deemed invalid,” it notes.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, and that European fighter jets be stationed in Poland.\n \n\n   \n  It limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel. It also calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the creation of a joint US-Russia “working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  It outlines a return of Russia into the global community, including the lifting of sanctions, invitation to rejoin the G8, and its reintegration into the global economy.\n \n\n   \n  The plan would see “all parties” in the war “receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court for the crime of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children. The plan calls for the return of “all civilian detainees and hostages,” including children, and the exchange of all prisoners of war and bodies.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to “be launched under the supervision of the IAEA, and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has made it very clear since day one, and even on the campaign trail, that he wants to see this war come to an end. He has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides of this war, Russia and Ukraine alike, for their refusal to commit to a peace agreement,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing. “Nevertheless, the president and his national security team are steadfast in seeing this war come to an end.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt rejected suggestions the plan was overly weighted toward Moscow, and said the administration had “talked equally with both sides” to create it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine, and we believe that it should be acceptable to both sides, and we’re working very hard to get it done,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Wednesday the document was a “list of potential ideas” rather than a completed proposal.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he wrote in  a post on X.  “And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some of the provisions being floated are likely to draw criticism from Ukraine and its backers since it would require significant land concessions. The two regions that  form the Donbas , Luhansk and Donetsk, are still partially held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal echoes a  peace proposal from talks  in Istanbul in the early weeks of the war in 2022, repeating some of Moscow’s wider geopolitical demands about Ukraine’s armed forces and allegiances.\n \n\n   \n    Talks in Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with Zelensky in Ukraine on Thursday and delivered him the Trump administration’s proposed peace plan, a US defense official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll and Zelensky discussed “a collaborative plan to achieve peace in Ukraine” and “agreed on an aggressive timeline for signature,” the defense official said. The official clarified that the US expected Zelensky to sign a framework with the US to work toward an eventual peace agreement, not sign onto a final peace deal itself.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how aggressive that timeline is, or whether Zelensky agreed to its points. European and Ukrainian officials told CNN on Wednesday that the plan appears to contain unacceptable and maximalist demands from Russia, including ceding territory in the eastern Donbas region that Russia does not even currently control.\n \n\n   \n  But the Ukrainian presidential office said Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President of Ukraine outlined the fundamental principles that matter to our people, and following today’s meeting, the parties agreed to work on the plan’s provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war,” the Ukrainian presidential office said, adding that Zelensky expects to speak with Trump in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why the Army was tasked with delivering the peace plan rather than diplomats, the defense official said the Army “comes from a trusted position” with the Ukrainians, and is also in Ukraine to hold meetings on battlefield innovation — a topic Driscoll has been deeply involved in throughout his tenure as secretary.\n \n\n   \n  “We come from a trusted position. The US Army is a proven Ukraine ally,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundhog Day’\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat echoed a Western official’s description of some of the details of the proposal. The person told CNN that the new effort, which repeats many of Moscow’s maximalist demands dating back to 2022, reminded them of “Groundhog Day,” a film in which events repeat themselves over and over.\n \n\n   \n  A European envoy based in Ukraine said the plan had caught the diplomatic community completely by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been gone through before and rejected, and now we’re back to square one,” the diplomat said. “For the Ukrainians, it is just a non-starter and with good reason. It would just be inviting the Russians to come back again at a future date. It would be political suicide for any Ukrainian leader (to accept it), and it would be military suicide to hand over that fortified area.”\n \n\n   \n  The diplomat also described foreign ministries in Europe and elsewhere calling contacts in Washington for guidance on the plan only to be told they were equally in the dark.\n \n\n   \n  “We have heard directly from people in the State Department and on Capitol Hill that nobody knew anything about this plan until it was leaked yesterday,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  “People who should have known about it, knew nothing about it … There’s a lot of annoyance and confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In her first public comments since reports of the plan emerged, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told reporters Thursday that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, meanwhile, told CNN that any plans should involve Europe and leave Kyiv with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a much bigger stake in this than the US, and therefore Ukraine, but also Europe, has to be involved,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said work on the talks was continuing “at the technical level between the teams” and that they were “carefully studying all of our partners’ proposals, expecting the same respectful attitude towards Ukraine’s position.”\n \n\n   \n  Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, told the Washington Post Live, “This is the start of a good process.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we’re finally having the leadership of the president of the United States, and this leadership is backed up by a real process, I think this is serious,” she said.   \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s special envoy,  Steve Witkoff , has been leading the effort, CNN reported on Wednesday, with a source saying the negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal. A US official said Witkoff had been quietly working on the plan for a month, with input from both the Ukrainians and the Russians on the terms they could accept.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, reiterated its denial that it was working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine, saying Thursday there were “no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have nothing new to add to what was said in Anchorage,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, referencing a meeting between Putin and Trump in Alaska in August. “We have no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Carey, Nick Paton Walsh, Brian Abel, and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/narrow-house-majority-congress-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000-05:00","title":"Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority gets a bit more breathing room after Sherrill’s resignation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has gained a bit more stability in his narrow Republican majority after Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill resigned to become governor of New Jersey.

resignation \n       \n  By Clare Foran, Annette Choi and Ethan Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has bit more room in his narrow House majority after Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill resigned to take office as New Jersey governor.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s resignation, two weeks after her election victory and two months before she takes office, will still leave Johnson needing the near-unanimous support of his party to advance legislation.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats, with three seats vacant. Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote, but has a bit more room for absences in his party.\n \n\n   \n  The next vacant seat to be filled will be in a Republican-leaning district in Tennessee, where a special election is scheduled for early next month. Then, at the end of January, two Texas Democrats will meet in a runoff to fill another vacancy. The special election for Sherrill’s seat is expected to take place early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/weather/texas-flash-flood-hill-country-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"Flood threat for soaked Dallas and Texas Hill Country persists overnight as storms keep firing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Significant flooding is ongoing in the Texas Hill Country, where over 9 inches of rain have fallen since Thursday morning, triggering a flash flood emergency for nearly 1,300 residents in southeastern Concho, western McCulloch, and central Menard counties.

bottom of the South China Sea that US experts say could yield sensitive information to China if Beijing were to get to them first.\n \n\n   \n  The aircraft – an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet and an MH-60 helicopter –  crashed within 30 minutes of each other  while operating off the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz during routine operations in late October.\n \n\n   \n  No official cause has been given for the crashes, but US President Donald Trump suggested to reporters shortly after the incidents that contaminated fuel may be to blame. All crew members were rescued.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy confirmed to CNN on Friday that a salvage ship was operating in the South China Sea, while not revealing the specific location where the aircraft crashed or where the salvage ship is now.\n \n\n   \n  “USNS SALVOR (T-ARS 52), a Safeguard-class salvage ship operated by Military Sealift Command, is on-scene conducting operations in support of the recovery efforts,” said Cmdr. Matthew Comer, a spokesperson for the Navy’s 7th Fleet in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  The Salvor is capable of lifting objects weighing up to 300 tons off the seafloor, according to Navy documents. The maximum takeoff weight of the newest F/A-18 models on the Nimitz is about 33 tons while the MH-60 weighs around 11 tons.\n \n\n   \n  While neither the F/A-18 nor the MH-60 are the most modern of the Navy’s aircraft, experts say the wrecks could yield useful intelligence if they fall into the hands of an adversary.\n \n\n   \n  “Acquiring an air frame and surviving systems will … provide valuable insights into its technological strengths and how to defeat it tactically,” said Carl Schuster, the former head of the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that an F/A-18 has never fallen into Chinese hands, but if one did, Beijing could gather information that could help it improve People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carrier-based J-15T jets, which are not considered as advanced as the F/A-18.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the MH-60 carries anti-submarine warfare systems that are likely more advanced than China’s, Schuster said.\n \n\n   \n  “China is now prioritizing the upgrading of its anti-submarine warfare systems. So, recovering that helicopter should enjoy a high priority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot confirm whether China is making any attempt to get to the lost US aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea, in defiance of an international court ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The current US recovery effort follows  a similar mission  in 2022, when an F-35 jet, the Navy’s most-advanced fighter,  crashed while attempting to land  on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.\n \n\n   \n  The F-35 was eventually pulled up from 12,400 feet (3,700 meters) of water by a Navy recovery team.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, China has fortified its territorial claims by constructing military installations on contested islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The US says China’s assertions and military buildup threaten freedom of navigation in the waterway, through which trade worth trillions of dollars passes every year.\n \n\n   \n  US forces maintain a steady presence in the region to push back on Chinese sovereignty claims and support Washington’s allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  But Schuster said Beijing has an edge on getting to wrecks in the South China Sea just based on proximity.\n \n\n   \n  “If China makes it a race, it enjoys homefield advantage, if you will, and can be expected to impede our recovery efforts” if possible, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said after the crashes that it could offer humanitarian assistance to the US Navy if needed.\n \n\n   \n  But a spokesperson also said that the crashes occurred during what he called “US military exercises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The US has been flexing muscles by frequently sending military vessels and aircraft to the South China Sea.

\nUpdated: \n        9:59 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Philippine court on Thursday convicted a  former mayor , who officials say is a Chinese national, of human trafficking charges for helping establish an illegal online gaming complex in a northern province where hundreds of Chinese and other foreign nationals were forced to conduct scams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pasig city regional trial court in metropolitan Manila sentenced Alice Guo to life in prison with seven other Filipino and Chinese co-accused, and ordered them to pay a fine of 2 million pesos ($34,000) each and compensate several trafficking victims, who filed the complaints.\n \n\n   \n  Guo denied all allegations against her and says she is a Filipino citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Vast online scam centers have  flourished  in Southeast Asia in recent years, especially in the border areas of  Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar . The UN has estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped in virtual slavery by gangs who force them to financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  In the Philippines, scam operations rapidly built vast compounds with buildings or rented upscale offices in Manila’s financial districts and moved around large numbers of workers by bribing authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine authorities allege that Guo is a Chinese national named Guo Huaping, who faked Filipino citizenship to run for mayor of the town of Bamban in northern Tarlac province, where she ran a sprawling illegal scam compound near the town hall.\n \n\n   \n  “They used the parcels of land and buildings to house the trafficked workers and to force them to work as scammers,” the court said in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a ban on hundreds of mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations, which proliferated under the administration of previous President Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos accused the gaming operations of crimes including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnapping and murder.\n \n\n   \n  Many have been raided and shut down since then, with tens of thousands of trafficked workers rescued and sent back to their home countries. But more scam centers remain in operation, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “The conviction of Alice Guo, also known as Guo Hua Ping, is a victory against corruption, human trafficking, cybercrime and many other transnational crimes,” said Sen. Risa Hontiveros. “But it is far from over.”\n \n\n   \n  Hontiveros led televised Senate inquiries last year that exposed underground online scam operations in the Philippines, along with Guo’s alleged criminal involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine security officials and Hontiveros have said the scam centers operated by Guo and other Chinese nationals may have also been used for espionage by China, which has had increasingly fierce territorial conflicts with the Philippines in the South China Sea and has strongly opposed the presence of American forces in the country. The Philippines is the oldest US treaty ally in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to demand accountability from every government agency that failed in their duties, and we will continue to investigate the full extent of Chinese intelligence operations in our country,” Hontiveros said. “And to all others who enabled Alice Guo’s criminal empire: the Philippines is not a playground for exploitation, infiltration and espionage.”\n \n\n   \n  Guo has not been charged with espionage and she denies any connection to spying.\n \n\n   \n  The town of Bamban is located several kilometers (miles) from a Philippine air force base, where American forces have been allowed to maintain a rotating presence with their aircraft and weapons under a 2014 defense pact.\n \n\n   \n  Guo was dismissed from her post as mayor last year by a state Ombudsman, who cited grave misconduct. She fled the Philippines in July 2024, but was tracked down in  Indonesia , where she was arrested and deported to the Philippines. She has been in detention since last year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/lawsuit-diddy-assault-jonathan-hay","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:07:00-05:00","title":"Jonathan Hay’s Allegations Against Diddy at Center of New Investigation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Hay, a music producer and publicist, has come forward with allegations of sexual battery by Sean 'Diddy' Combs in 2020 and 2021, during which Combs allegedly masturbated into a shirt from Notorious B.I.G. and forced Hay to perform oral sex.

Now, his claims are at the center of a new investigation involving Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:07 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In March 2023 – eight months before Cassie Ventura filed the bombshell lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend Sean “Diddy” Combs that would ignite his  public downfall  and ultimately lead to  his criminal conviction  – another accuser was contemplating coming forward.\n \n\n   \n  Music producer and publicist Jonathan Hay had contacted a civil attorney in the spring of 2023 to discuss his claims of being sexually battered by Combs.  After speaking with the attorney’s office, Hay got cold feet, fearful of standing up against a figure as powerful as Combs. He was, he said, “terrified.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reviewed email correspondence showing Hay reached out to the civil attorney’s office in March 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, I can’t do this,” Hay said of his first attempt to come forward with his claims against Combs in early 2023. “I’m just not ready.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay finally filed his claims against Combs – then as a “John Doe” – in July 2025, shortly after Combs was convicted by a New York jury on two federal prostitution-related counts that would lead to him being sentenced to more than four years.\n \n\n   \n  Once Ventura filed her lawsuit and dozens of other civil accusers came forward with lawsuits, he felt encouraged to tell his story. Hay said that he’d never considered that there could have been others who had allegedly been abused by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs denies all accusations against him.  Roughly 70 accusers  have brought civil lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  “Once Cassie’s lawsuit came out,” Hay said, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go. And then once the raids happened, I was like holy crap. That’s when I was like, ‘Okay, now is my time. Finally, I just decided that, alright, I’m going to go forward with this.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted someone to listen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Hay’s claims are at the center of a new investigation, launched this week by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Department confirmed that their Special Victims Bureau is investigating Hay’s claims after receiving a copy of his police report, first documented in September 2025 by police in Largo, Florida, where Hay resides.\n \n\n   \n  In the police report, Hay says he suffered from sexual battery by Combs in 2020, and then again in 2021, when he was working on a remix of Christopher “The Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace’s music as a tribute project, honoring one of Combs’ closest collaborators. Hay worked on the new music with the rapper’s son, CJ Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2020 incident, Hay said he was working at a photoshoot when he found himself in the same room as Combs, who began to masturbate into one of Biggie’s shirts. The police report details that Combs “removed the shirt to uncover his penis and told Hay to come finish him off.” The report states that Hay told police he was in shock and “stated that Combs then finished himself off and ejaculated on one of Notorious B.I.G. shirts” and then threw the shirt on Hay, “simultaneously saying, ‘Rest in peace BIG.’”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Hay told police that Combs forced him to perform oral sex on him, which he said made him feel suicidal.\n \n\n   \n  Hay said that a detective from the LASD’s Special Victims Bureau contacted him on Tuesday this week to notify him that she had been assigned to his case.\n \n\n   \n  Hay is cooperating with authorities, hopeful that their active investigation may lead to further criminal charges.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggie was like his supposedly his best friend,” he said. “To just do that in a shirt and to attack me like he had?” Hay said. “He doesn’t need to be out on the streets.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality’\n \n\n   \n  Hay’s allegations first became public this July when he filed his lawsuit anonymously against both Combs and Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace is named as a defendant with Hay claiming that he and others “conspired” with Combs to “allow or assist in Combs’ ability to carry out” his actions against Hay.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace has filed a defamation suit against Hay. In it, he claims that Hay falsified these accusations because he was “irate” that Biggie’s estate decided not to release the majority of the songs produced back in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “Jonathan Hay’s allegations against CJ Wallace will be shown to be a complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality,” Jeremiah Reynolds, an attorney for Wallace, told CNN. “We look forward to Hay eventually being held liable in court for defamation.”\n \n\n   \n  “CJ knows what happened,” Hay said. “He was there. He lived it.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs also denies Hay’s claims, as he has done with the dozens of accusers who have sued him.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, a lawyer for Combs issued a blanket denial statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As Mr. Combs’ legal team has repeatedly stated for over a year now, he cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a media circus. Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone,” Jonathan Davis, a civil attorney for Combs, said in a statement. “He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided – and not in the media – based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay said he is not surprised that Combs continues to deny his allegations, and he remains focused on pursuing justice through his case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that when he gets out of jail,” Hay said, “that he is taken straight to jail in California, or to go through the court proceedings in California, and that he spends the rest of his life in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  After a two-month federal trial in New York earlier this year, Combs is currently serving his four-plus year sentence at Fort Dix federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to respect the jurors and the decision that they made,” Hay said of the conviction, which Combs is currently appealing. “At least he got some time. And hopefully we can add more.”\n \n\n   \n   Jason Kravarik contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/chicago-marimar-martinez-shooting-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"Federal judge dismisses charges against Chicago woman shot after being accused of ramming car at law enforcement vehicle","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Georgia Alexakis, dismissed federal charges against Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, after she was shot by Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum in Chicago on October 4, 2025.

I’m happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been hard,” she said. “I can’t sleep, but now I’m gonna go sleep.”\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been accused of closely pursuing Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4.

Martinez suffered five gunshot wounds, Parente previously told CNN.

Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge an “MOF” is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one-up someone wherever possible.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what exactly Exum was responding to, because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text message, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Referencing the messages, Parente said, “He’s going to pay for those shots, and he’s not going to be as proud and as arrogant as he was when he testified in this courthouse a few weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis  said she was skeptical  about why the cars of Martinez and Ruiz were kept in Chicago as evidence, while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally.\n \n\n   \n  “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said previously.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Omar Jimenez and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/censure-process-congress-bipartisan-reform","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-05:00","title":"Bipartisan Push to Reform Censure Process Emerges in Congress After Flurry of Complaints Against Lawmakers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan effort in the U.S. House of Representatives is underway to reform the censure process, with lawmakers on both sides urging a shift from a simple majority to a 60% threshold to prevent political overreach.

This week alone, lawmakers had already weighed three different complaints in just as many days.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the wave of complaints this week, Reps. Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat, and Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, have sponsored a bill to raise the threshold for a censure to 60% of the House – rather than the current simple majority.\n \n\n   \n  “I just think we’ve got out of control,” Bacon said Thursday. “It should be more bipartisan when we do one.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed openness to reforming the process, saying it “needs to be brought under control” and that he is “open-minded” about raising the threshold.\n \n\n   \n  The minority leader, however, squarely blamed Republicans, describing their censure efforts as “extreme.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, retiring Democratic  Rep. Chuy García  of Illinois was censured for allegedly coordinating his own retirement to ensure his hand-picked replacement would win his seat next year. It was fellow Democrat, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, who forced the House to take up the symbolic resolution against García, infuriating members of her party.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, 22 Democrats voted with Gluesenkamp Perez to reprimand Garcia, along with 213 Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  The same day, a vote to censure Democratic  Del. Stacey Plaskett , for texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, failed on a 209-214 vote. Three Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure and three Republicans registering as “present.”\n \n\n   \n  If the vote to censure Plaskett had passed, Democrats had planned to bring up a resolution against Florida GOP  Rep. Cory Mills , who has faced a swirl of controversies in his time in Congress, including an  allegation of assault  against Mills and  accusations from  an ex-girlfriend that he threatened to release sexually explicit images and videos of her.\n \n\n   \n  But on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina brought a complaint against Mills, pointing to individuals who served with Mills in the Army disputing his version of events that led him to be recommended for the Bronze Star, which was reported on by  NOTUS . The complaint was referred to the House Ethics Committee after a vote to censure him failed despite seven Republicans joining Mace in favor of the measure.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-recission-tally","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00Z","title":"NCAA Currently Falling Short to Rescind Rule That Would Allow College Athletes to Gamble on Professional Sports, Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the NCAA approaches a critical deadline to rescind a rule allowing college athletes, coaches, and staff to gamble on professional sports, it is falling short of the required 241 Division I school threshold—only 188 have submitted requests.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.

Betting on college sports would still be against the rules.\n \n\n   \n  The rule change originally was meant to go into effect on November 1 – a week after the sweeping indictments involving the NBA and members of New York crime families.

Her “ Jimson Weed/White Flower No.1 ,” which had previously hung in the White House, sold for $44.4 million in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo’s surrealist self portrait, which was sold by a private collector, had been valued at between $40 million and $60 million. Another of the Mexican artist’s self portraits “Diego y yo” (Diego and I) previously held the title for second most expensive artwork sold by a female artist after also being auctioned by Sotheby’s, New York, in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  When sold, that painting became the most expensive piece of Latin American art ever. It’s now been overtaken by Kahlo’s more recent sale, and drops down to second place  –  and third for the most valuable artwork by a woman.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the auction, the painting, which had not been seen publicly for almost three decades, was shown in London, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Paris and New York.\n \n\n   \n  It sees Kahlo lying on a bed that floats against the backdrop of a pale blue sky. Curling green vines envelop her body, while a skeleton wired with dynamite and holding a bouquet of dried flowers lies above her.\n \n\n   \n  The bed was a regular motif in Kahlo’s work. She was confined to her bed for long periods of time as she endured a life of chronic pain following a near-fatal bus accident and subsequent surgeries.\n \n\n   \n  During the long recovery after the accident, Kahlo’s family set up an adapted easel and fitted a mirror to the canopy of the bed so she could continue to paint while lying flat. “I am not dead and I have a reason to live. That reason is painting,” she wrote at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo painted the piece in 1940, which was a turbulent time for the Mexican artist.

Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  One witness in the Schiff matter, a Republican from California named Christine Bish, said she traveled to Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday morning in response to a grand jury subpoena. Bish said she spoke to federal investigators inside the courthouse who asked her about people who told her they were working with Trump administration officials leading the mortgage probes.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re investigating each other,” Bish later told CNN in a telephone interview. “It’s stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  The subpoena Bish received demanded she give to the prosecutors in Maryland any communications she had with “any person or persons claiming to be” working under the Federal Housing Finance Director  Bill Pulte , the Justice Department official  Ed Martin , or others “claiming to be acting at the direction or request” of them or their offices, according to the subpoena reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte helped to prompt the Schiff and James investigations, as well as mortgage fraud-related inquiries into other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte in particular has played an extraordinary role in the probes by publicly making criminal referrals to the Justice Department, a step normally taken through mortgage investigators in his agency. And Martin has touted his pursuit of Trump’s political foes.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors are also looking into whether grand jury materials gathered in the James case were illegally shared with people who were not authorized to review it, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. James has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department declined to comment. The FHFA, its inspector general’s office and Martin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Pulte also were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  Bish, who previously ran for office in California, has publicly said she had information to share about Schiff related to his mortgages. She told CNN on Thursday that when she came to the Greenbelt courthouse, she believed she was going to provide grand jury testimony on Schiff and mortgage fraud, but that prosecutors “seemed more concerned” about looking into whether “there was conspiracy or collusion between me and Pulte or me and Ed Martin.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she passed her independent findings on Schiff to Pulte’s office earlier this year, after she said his office contacted her directly.\n \n\n   \n  Schiff is one of Trump’s longtime political foes, with the president in September pushing in a Truth Social post for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute him.\n \n\n   \n  “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action,”  Trump wrote in the post . “Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office have been hesitant to proceed with charges against Schiff, CNN previously reported. Schiff has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crime, and his attorney declined to comment for this story Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re trying to tie me into some kind of clandestine conspiracy, it’s not there, and the best way to protect myself is to be open and honest and public,” Bish said Thursday, adding later: “Something’s not adding up. And I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but I will.”\n \n\n   \n  The interview questions Bish was asked on Thursday went beyond any probe into Schiff, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “They assured me, when they interviewed me, that the focus of the investigation was Adam Schiff. And I kept pulling the testimony back to Schiff, but it seemed like they were looking for more — stuff that doesn’t exist,” Bish said at the courthouse on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators focused their questions on two people whom Bish said reached out to her for information on Schiff.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people worked in the first Trump administration and claimed to work for Pulte, and Bish said she spoke to the person several times. The other person said he was affiliated with the mortgage agency Freddie Mac, according to Bish, and she said she spoke to him once.\n \n\n   \n  “You know – had I ever talked to Director Pulte? Had I ever talked to Ed Martin? Did I have any communication with them? And that’s where the conversation kept going back,” she added. “So I don’t know if they’re on a fishing expedition or you know what’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she has never spoken with Martin.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Evan Perez and Kara Scannell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and comment. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-mack-rhoades-resigns-from-baylor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:51:00-05:00","title":"Baylor AD Mack Rhoades Resigns, a Week After Taking Leave for Personal Reasons","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mack Rhoades, Baylor University’s athletic director and former chairman of the College Football Playoff selection committee, resigned on November 20, 2025, following a one-week leave of absence for personal reasons.

But moments later, a top Department of Homeland Security official rejected that characterization.\n \n\n   \n  DHS dubbed the operation in Charlotte, which led to over 370 arrests, “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Over more than five days, enforcement actions disrupted life across the city, resulting in business closures, children kept out of school, and widespread fear in the community.\n \n\n   \n  At the helm of the operation was top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who, along with some of his federal agents, left Charlotte Thursday, according to a Homeland Security official, fueling confusion about the state of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the sheriff’s statement was released, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “Wrong. Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification on the operation’s status. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office says it stands by its statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to  what happened in Chicago  after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his agents are  expected to launch an operation in New Orleans  after the Thanksgiving holiday ,  as early as December 1, continuing the recent focus on city-specific immigration enforcement operations.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said  in a post  following McFadden’s announcement that she is “relieved for our community,” and urged the city to “come together” as they move forward.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said in a statement Thursday. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust.\n \n\n   \n    Federal agents leave behind a city rocked by fear and confusion\n \n\n   \n  In the few days that federal agents focused their immigration enforcement crackdown on North Carolina’s largest city,  fear and confusion  swept through the Charlotte community.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN’s Gustavo Valdes she had been getting questions from students such as, “What is going to happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?” and “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  She described having only nine students show up on one day this week, as parents were afraid to send their children to school or, in some cases, parents with legal status drove the children of undocumented parents to class.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students — about 20% of district enrollment — were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said, citing updated data from the beginning of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  When a CNN crew in a black SUV was parked near a school this week, an official asked them to move their vehicle because it resembled a CBP vehicle and was frightening parents picking up their children.\n \n\n   \n  One  nonprofit  estimates about half of the mom-and-pop businesses it works with have  closed at some point  during the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  A family-run Colombian bakery, which has closed only once in its 28-year history,  closed last week, with the family unsure of when it will reopen .\n \n\n   \n  While some in the community are expressing relief that the operation may be over, others remain skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that provides legal services to people in removal proceedings,  warned the community  not to “let your guard down” as ICE is still operating in the area and other parts of the state.\n \n\n   \n  “CBP might be leaving but ICE is still here!” the group said in an Instagram post.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte and Chicago could help New Orleans prepare\n \n\n   \n  While the Charlotte operation appears to have concluded, an immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans is expected as early as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Some in Charlotte’s community  adopted tactics  they saw activists use in Chicago, such as watching for raids, blowing warning whistles, and carrying signs advising people of their rights. In Charlotte,  some  also  stood outside the entrance  of a local ICE processing facility to block federal agents, a method frequently seen at the  Broadview ICE facility  near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Both cities  quickly mobilized  to train community members on how to respond if they saw an immigration raid or ICE presence.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte was a departure from what is typical in these operations, notably being much shorter — at less than a week — than the operation in Chicago, which started in early September.\n \n\n   \n  The operation also  took Charlotte by surprise , as President Donald Trump had not mentioned the city as a target. In contrast, while local and state officials in Chicago said federal officials  hadn’t shared details  about the operation or its timing, Trump  frequently named Chicago  as a  target  for a federal crime crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The focus now appears to be shifting to New Orleans, a city President Trump considered sending the National Guard to  as early as September . New Orleans would be one of the first Democratic-led cities in a Republican-led state targeted for an immigration enforcement operation. CNN has reached out to local and state officials to see how they are preparing for the potential operation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/fugees-pras-michel-sentenced-prison-obama","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00-05:00","title":"Fugees Rapper Pras Michel Sentenced to 14 Years in Prison Over Illegal Donations to Obama Campaign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pras Michel, a Grammy-winning rapper and founding member of the Fugees, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for illegally funneling over $120 million in foreign contributions from Malaysian billionaire Jho Low to Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign.

Prakazrel “Pras” Michel  of  the Fugees  was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to

2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said “betrayed his country for money” and “lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.”\n \n\n   \n  “His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,”  they wrote .\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client’s 14-year sentence is “completely disproportionate to the offense.” Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an “absurdly high” punishment for Michel given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel’s attorneys said in a court filing.\n \n\n   \n  “The Government’s position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,”  they wrote .\n \n\n   \n  Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the US from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean.

Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “Low’s motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,” Michel’s attorneys wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel’s request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney’s  use of a generative AI program  during his closing of the trial’s arguments.

These are mostly preventable with the right precautions.\n \n\n   \n  I want to make sure that the food my family and I are preparing is safe—and so are the leftovers, so I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where her responsibilities included overseeing food safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   What causes foodborne infections? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Foodborne infections are caused by pathogens, like bacteria, viruses and parasites. In the US, the most common form of foodborne infection is  norovirus , which is a contagious virus that spreads from person to person through sharing utensils or touching objects that an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth. There are also several bacteria that cause foodborne illness, including salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter and listeria.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What symptoms do people experience? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Typical symptoms of foodborne illness include abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Many people recover within 24 hours, but some can become very ill, depending on the pathogen and their underlying medical conditions. Those at highest risk for complications are young children, pregnant women, older individuals and people with immunocompromising medical illnesses.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: I’ve seen a lot of recalls for food products.  How do I make sure that the food I’m preparing is OK before placing it out at meals? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Rhere have been  several instances of high-profile food recalls , but it’s important to remember that the majority of foodborne illnesses occur in everyday settings that don’t involve high-profile cases. Definitely be aware of food recalls (the US government maintains a  comprehensive list of recent recalls ) and make sure that you don’t have products in your fridge or pantry that are deemed unsafe. But don’t obsess over it, as chances are that the food you buy will be safe. However, there are many other things that you can and need to do make sure you abide by safe food preparing practices.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Let’s talk about some of these best practices. How do I defrost my turkey safely? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This is a great question and applies not only to turkey but also to other poultry and meat. The concern is to keep bacteria from growing when the turkey thaws.\n \n\n   \n  There are  three ways to safely thaw turkey . The easiest, though the one that takes the longest, is to thaw in the refrigerator. You put the turkey in a container to prevent it from dripping onto other food. It generally takes 24 hours for each four to five pounds of turkey, so an 8-pound turkey could take two days, and a 12-pound turkey could take three days.\n \n\n   \n  The second way is to wrap the turkey in a leak-proof bag and submerge it in cold water. This takes about 30 minutes per pound, so the 8-pound turkey will take about 4 hours to thaw. You could use tap water and change the water every 30 minutes. It’s important to cook the turkey immediately after it is thawed to prevent bacteria growth.\n \n\n   \n  The third way is to use a microwave. How long it will take depends on the specific microwave. This is the fastest method, but because some parts of the turkey will start to cook during microwaving, it’s essential to cook the turkey right after thawing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not a good idea to leave the turkey thawing on the counter in a warm room. That’s because parts of the turkey may still be frozen while some parts reach high enough temperature for the bacteria to rapidly multiply.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How long can a Thanksgiving buffet sit out? Does it vary by dish? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The rule of thumb to keep in mind is the “two-hour rule.” Once the food is cooked, it should not be left at room temperature for  more than two hours . In the summer, if this is an outdoor picnic and the temperature is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, food should be refrigerated after an hour.\n \n\n   \n  This rule applies to all perishable foods, including meat, fish and milk products. Cooked leftovers should be refrigerated. The foods that do not need to be refrigerated according to the two-hour rule are baked goods such as cookies and cakes, dried meat such as jerky, whole fruit that is not chopped, and nuts.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What if the food is on a burner or in a slow cooker to keep it warm? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The temperature at which bacteria multiples rapidly is between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. If the food is being kept warm by an appliance such that is over 140 degrees Fahrenheit — or if it’s being kept cooled at below 40 degrees Fahrenheit — this does not count toward the two-hour rule. But  within two hours  of removing from the warming or cooling apparatus, it needs to be refrigerated.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: The fridge is my friend, right? Can food go into the fridge so we can enjoy leftovers the next day? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes, if it is stored in a timely manner in the refrigerator. Leftovers can typically be kept in the fridge for  three to four days . They can also be frozen for three to four months.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other safety tips people should keep in mind before gatherings? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  We’ve talked about thawing and storage of leftovers, and we also need to discuss cooking or reheating to the right temperature. The temperature varies  depending  on the type of meat or fish. An internal meat thermometer is crucial for monitoring the temperature. Make sure that fish is cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and chicken, turkey and poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n \n\n   \n  Be aware of cross-contamination. Do not use containers or utensils you have used with raw meat or fish to touch other products, like vegetables and fruits.\n \n\n   \n  Also, remember that norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness. People who have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps or other symptoms of norovirus should not prepare food. Everyone should wash their hands often and well with soap and water.\n \n\n   \n  Event hosts should also ask that those who are experiencing signs of respiratory infection to stay home. And those who are especially vulnerable to severe illness due to underlying conditions should take additional precautions that are appropriate for their individual circumstance.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/china/china-japan-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:36:00-05:00","title":"The real reason behind China’s fury toward Japan’s Takaichi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has sparked a major diplomatic standoff with China by suggesting a military response if China attempts to take control of Taiwan by force.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weeks into the job,  Japan ’s new leader has come face-to-face with what it means to cross  China ’s red line on Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since  Sanae Takaichi  suggested her country could respond militarily if China were to move to take control of Taiwan by force, Beijing has pulled out its economic pressure playbook: warning its citizens against travel and study there, suggesting there’ll be no market in China for Japan’s seafood exports, and unleashing a wave of wall-to-wall nationalist fervor pointed at the prime minister.\n \n\n   \n   The furor  appears carefully calibrated to send a warning to Japan – and other countries in the region – of what could happen if they even consider taking a stance at odds with China on Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that Beijing claims as its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  But the spat, which shows no sign of abating roughly two weeks on, also reveals something else: Beijing’s deep-seated concerns about the potential for changing military postures in Asia – as US allies ramp up defense spending and coordination in the face of its own  rising military might .\n \n\n   \n  No other country piques those concerns like Japan, whose Imperial Army in the 20th century invaded, occupied and waged atrocities on China and, decades earlier, colonized Taiwan – key pain points in China’s so-called “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers.\n \n\n   \n  Anti-Japanese sentiment has simmered in the country since that time – flaring up and gaining traction in recent years with nationalist hardliners’ voices becoming increasingly mainstream in China under strongman leader Xi Jinping.\n \n\n   \n  Reinforcing the ruling Communist Party’s longstanding determination to ensure history can never repeat itself, Xi has rapidly modernized China’s military and grown its global influence.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in Beijing’s eyes, Takaichi’s comments reveal that Japan does not respect the vast rebalancing of power that’s positioned China as an ascendant superpower – and that it has military ambitions that could threaten China’s rise.\n \n\n   \n  “For the first time, a Japanese leader has expressed ambitions for armed intervention in Taiwan and issued a military threat against China,” a commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily  said  earlier this week. “Behind this lies the dangerous attempt by Japan’s right-wing forces to break free from the constraints of the pacifist constitution and seek the status of a ‘military power.’”\n \n\n   \n    Japan’s ‘militarism’\n \n\n   \n  Japan has made a  sweeping shift  in its security posture in recent years, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, to boost its defense budget and acquire counterstrike capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  That’s come as Beijing has ramped up its military activities in the region, including around Taiwan – and as the US has pushed its allies for more burden-sharing on defense spending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response, but politicians – particularly among right wingers in Takaichi’s party – are increasingly wary of the implications for Tokyo if Beijing attacks Taiwan, which sits strategically to Japan’s south. This sentiment has resulted in a growing impetus to further expand Japan’s defense spending and even change the constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Now Takaichi, a hawkish figure who has previously drawn Beijing’s ire for questioning some of the narratives around imperial Japan’s culpability for its war atrocities, has taken the step of speaking plainly on the Taiwan issue. In the first days of her term, she also called for closer security ties with the US and is moving to accelerate the country’s defense build-up.\n \n\n   \n  In Beijing’s eyes,  according to  a social media account linked to the Chinese military, such efforts run the risk of seeing “the ‘ghost’ of militarism” reemerge “to wreak havoc in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  And that’s why some on the Japanese side feel that Beijing is lashing out now “to box Takaichi in and put her on the back foot early on – so she will be more reluctant to push forward on Japan’s investment in defense,” according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed civilians during its occupation, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the Nanjing Massacre, one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century. Japan has repeatedly apologized and expressed remorse for its wartime atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  That era, however, has been front and center in China this year as Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II, when Japan’s surrender to Allied Forces freed China from its occupation and saw Taiwan handed over to the Nationalist-run Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Communist Party established the People’s Republic of China in 1949 after emerging victorious from a civil war, while the defeated Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. Beijing has used the anniversary to justify its claim to the island – and broadcast concern about what it sees as Japan’s turn toward militarism.\n \n\n   \n  China sees taking control of Taiwan as a core piece of the “national rejuvenation” that it must complete by mid-century – a goal that, if Beijing decides must be achieved by force, could be heavily complicated by a stronger Japan.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, Takaichi’s comments can be summed up as “the wrong person, talking about the wrong thing” at the “wrong time,” according to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Defending its sovereignty’\n \n\n   \n  Despite Tokyo dispatching an envoy to Beijing earlier this week to calm the dispute, Beijing has showed no signs of dialing back its deluge of rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  It’s instead insisting Tokyo retracts the comment – a position that offers neither side an easy way to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, China has continued to stoke nationalist feelings, including sabre-rattling from China’s military, which on Wednesday released a video titled “Don’t be too cocky.” Without mentioning Japan by name, it includes a rap crooning: “We’ve honed our skills through rigorous training, how can we allow you to be so cocky?”\n \n\n   \n  But it may be an image of Japan’s foreign ministry envoy Masaaki Kanai and his Chinese counterpart Liu Jinsong following their meeting in Beijing earlier this week that underscores why China won’t want to ease up pressure just yet.\n \n\n   \n  That image – showing Liu standing straight with his hands in his pockets, talking to Kanai who tilts his head forward while listening – has gone viral across Chinese social media.\n \n\n   \n  Commentators have referred to the Japanese diplomat as “bowing,” while they hailed the choice of Liu’s attire – a suit whose style is associated with China’s May Fourth anti-Imperialism movement of 1919.\n \n\n   \n  The symbolism, it appears, was no coincidence: “China’s stance in defending its sovereignty remains unchanged for a century,” said a caption on a post from state broadcaster CCTV.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/hang-democrats-trump-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-05:00","title":"Why Democrats Are Warning About Trump Giving Illegal Orders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congressional Democrats have issued a video warning military members not to obey potentially illegal orders from President Donald Trump, particularly in light of his recent military actions—such as strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean—some of which have been condemned by international bodies like the United Nations and the United Kingdom as extrajudicial killings.

And yet again, he’s basing this argument on a rather novel legal theory and a dubious interpretation of the facts.\n \n\n   \n  A half-dozen congressional Democrats cut a video this week urging members of the military  not to obey unlawful orders  that Trump might issue. Trump then responded by issuing a series of social media posts suggesting these members had committed sedition and possibly even deserved to die.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from saying they should be arrested, to re-posting someone who said George Washington would “HANG THEM,” to saying “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Thursday that Trump  does not, in fact, want members of Congress put to death .\n \n\n   \n  But she otherwise stood by the idea that these members were acting dangerously and undermining the commander in chief. She said the members were urging members of the military to “defy the chain of command.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are literally saying to 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers to defy the chain of command – not to follow lawful orders,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  But that is not what they were literally saying.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the members were not urging anyone to disobey “lawful orders.” They explicitly referred in the video only to  unlawful  orders – and repeatedly so.\n \n\n   \n  The other problem is that “defying the chain of command” isn’t just something military servicemembers are  allowed  to do in such cases; it’s something they’re often  required  to do.\n \n\n   \n  The section of Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice dealing with failing to obey orders states that members can only be sanctioned for disobeying lawful orders. And servicemembers are generally obligated to not follow orders that are “manifestly unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  If there’s a potentially more legitimate objection to Democrats’ video, it’s that they’re erecting a straw man – basically that they’re inventing out of whole cloth the prospect of Trump issuing illegal orders, in order to make military servicemembers hesitant to abide his orders.\n \n\n   \n  This is the argument that some of Trump’s allies have gone for on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t name the unlawful orders that these guys are bringing up in their video, you know, that just shows me that you don’t have the courage to even call out what you’re talking about,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum in a separate segment pressed Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, one of the lawmakers in the video, repeatedly on the same subject.\n \n\n   \n  “What specific order from the commander in chief that we are asking our military to carry out are you objecting to?” MacCallum said. “This is very, very vague.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not as if this is a prospect Democrats have invented out of whole cloth. Trump has given them plenty to work with, including some things  Crow mentioned in the interview .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly proposed doing things – with the military and otherwise – that appear to be illegal. People who served with him have said he suggested illegal action. And Trump is certainly testing the bounds of the law with his use of the military even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  The big example right now is Trump’s strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean – strikes that have  killed more than 80 people  without a legal process.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that both the United Nations and top allies like the United Kingdom regard the strikes  as illegal extrajudicial killings . Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has echoed those claims, while other GOP senators have questioned their legality as well. The administration has also declined to publicly detail its legal justification, even as the Justice Department has produced a  classified legal opinion  authorizing the strikes. It has released survivors of the strikes who, if they had been kept in US custody, could have  forced it to defend itself in court . Also, a top commander who CNN has reported  raised questions about the legality of the strikes  is now retiring early.\n \n\n   \n  There is a very real question about whether the servicemembers involved in those strikes are carrying out illegal orders. And the administration has proactively avoided a more robust legal process that could settle that question.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s hardly all. Here are some other key data points:\n \n\n   \n  It’s certainly provocative for Democrats to raise this issue like they have. But it’s not as if they’ve conjured it out of thin air.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/north-korea-operatives-fake-job-portal-ai-firms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:18:00-05:00","title":"North Korean Operatives Running Fake Job Portal Targeting US AI Firms","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korean operatives have launched a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign by creating a fake job application platform that mimics the legitimate tech hiring site Lever.

   \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  North Korean operatives created a fake job-application platform targeting applicants to major US artificial intelligence and crypto firms as part of a new effort to steal money and know-how for the Kim Jong Un regime,  researchers said  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a twist on a yearslong campaign to infiltrate Fortune 500 companies: Instead of simply impersonating employees of those companies,  North Korean  tech workers are now working to gain long-term access to the computers of applicants before they join a company, according to security firm Validin, which discovered the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  “Going after job seekers gives North Korean actors a huge advantage. Instead of trying to slip past an employer’s defenses, they take over the entire hiring process and make it feel completely legitimate to individuals,” Validin’s chief executive Kenneth Kinion told CNN. “People assume they’re doing a normal coding test or following steps for a promising job opportunity, so they’re far more likely to run whatever the interviewer sends them.”\n \n\n   \n  The fake jobs platform mimics the style and substance of Lever, a headhunting platform that boasts tens of thousands of customers. Among the fictional jobs advertised on the North Korean-built platform are a “product manager” related to Claude, the popular AI model developed by San Francisco-based firm Anthropic.\n \n\n   \n  Anthropic’s technology is in high demand. The firm committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft’s compute capacity to expand the use of Claude, Microsoft announced this week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from Lever, Anthropic and all the other companies impersonated in the scheme. The North Korean diplomatic mission in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Because many candidates don’t want their current employer to know they’re looking elsewhere, they’re less likely to report anything suspicious, making it even easier for the attackers to slip through unnoticed,” Kinion said.\n \n\n   \n  Kinion, whose team discovered the fake job portal this week, said he wasn’t aware of anyone who has fallen victim to the scheme yet, but many have fallen for past industrial espionage campaigns tied to Pyongyang.\n \n\n   \n  For years, North Korean workers have used fraudulent identities and sometimes passed interview screenings to infiltrate American companies big and small. The workers then send the money back to Pyongyang to support the regime’s rogue weapons program, according to private experts and US officials.\n \n\n   \n  A previous CNN  investigation  showed how the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korean hackers have also  stolen billions of dollars  from banks and cryptocurrency firms over the last several years, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. A White House official  estimated  in 2023 that half of  North Korea’s  missile program had been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft.\n \n\n   \n  A series of US indictments and sanctions has raised awareness of the insider IT worker threat. Pyongyang has evolved its tactics in response, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  “These operators appear to hold elevated privileges, far beyond what a standard IT worker receives, which is evident from their more malicious activities,” Michael Barnhart, a North Korea-focused researcher at insider threat firm DTEX Systems, told CNN. “This reinforces the notion that these activities are part of a broader, well-integrated ecosystem within North Korea’s cyber operations.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"CDC Website Changed to Include False Claims Linking Autism and Vaccines","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The CDC’s website has been updated with misleading and scientifically invalid claims that suggest a possible link between vaccines and autism, despite extensive research showing no such connection.

They’re very clear, and it’s time to move on.”\n \n\n   \n  The preponderance of scientific evidence shows that vaccines do not cause autism, Singer said.\n \n\n   \n  “ No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines . This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Paul Offit agrees. In a  post on Substack  on Thursday, Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said scientific studies can “never prove never.”\n \n\n   \n  “If RFK Jr. wanted to be honest with the American public, he would make it clear on the CDC’s website that chicken nuggets also might cause autism, which has never been and will never be disproven,” Offit wrote.\n \n\n   \n  HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC’s website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on an episode of his  “Chasing Life” podcast  that he doesn’t think vaccines cause autism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s no medicine that’s 1,000% safe,” Makary said. “And I think we have to remember that with everything. I think the absolutism around some of this stuff creates mistrust. And when we say they’re 1,000% safe and it’s impossible for there to be a single complication of a vaccine, that’s the kind of rhetoric, I think, that doesn’t resonate well. So I think we have be humble and take a very honest approach.”\n \n\n   \n    Studies find no relationship\n \n\n   \n  Other bullets on the updated CDC page say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This too is not true: Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proved to be poorly done or were fraudulent. There are, however, many well-done, credible studies that find no such relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One of the  largest studies  looking at this question was published in 2019. Researchers in Denmark enrolled more than 650,000 children born between 1999 and 2011 and followed them from the time they were 1 year of age until the end of August 2013. Roughly 6,500 children were diagnosed with autism during the study period.\n \n\n   \n  When the researchers compared those who received the MMR vaccine with those who did not, they found no significant difference in the risk of developing autism. That held true whether the kids got other vaccines, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine; whether they had siblings with autism; or a host of other factors, such as whether certain kids might be prone to developing a form of regressive autism after getting their shots.\n \n\n   \n  “This study strongly supports that MMR vaccine does not increase the risk for autism,” the authors wrote in the conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  This study is not cited on the CDC’s updated “state of the evidence” on MMR vaccines, however. Instead, it mentions older evidence reviews and raises questions about aluminum, an ingredient added to some vaccines to boost their protection.\n \n\n   \n  The new CDC updates do mention another recent Danish study, published in 2025, which found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of 50 disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. But instead of accepting the overall conclusion of the study, the new CDC page tries to cast doubt on it by homing in on details of data in a supplementary table, saying the findings and other “warrant further investigation” into aluminum exposure and chronic diseases.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC page also says the US Department of Health and Human Services has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\n \n\n   \n  Singer said this is a waste of valuable research money and a distraction from strong science showing that most cases of autism can be traced to genes that affect a baby’s brain development.\n \n\n   \n  The main heading  on the page  states that “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but it has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”\n \n\n   \n  The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana,  during his confirmation process  that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy told CNN on Thursday that he had spoken with Kennedy.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted on X on Thursday, Cassidy said, “I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Dangerous health disinformation’\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Peter Hotez, who is director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and wrote a book called “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism” about his daughter’s diagnosis, said the updated information on the CDC’s page follows a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve decided they want to prove vaccines cause autism. So they keep making a series of assertions,” Hotez said, going back to debunked research that claimed the MMR vaccines caused autism and a retracted 2005 Rolling Stone article by Kennedy that asserted the preservative thimerosal caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  There have also been claims that aluminum in vaccines was a cause of autism, and those have been disproved, Hotez said.\n \n\n   \n  Hotez says the updates to the CDC’s page are “pure garbage.”\n \n\n   \n  “I consider it a piece of dangerous health disinformation, and it needs to be removed right away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on social media late Wednesday that the changes are “a national embarrassment.”\n \n\n   \n  “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Daskalakis said the agency’s scientists were completely blindsided by the page update.\n \n\n   \n  “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than restoring trust in America’s health agencies, moves like this have undermined it, said Dr. Sean O’ Leary, a pediatrician who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear that it’s going to lead to fewer children being vaccinated, children suffering from diseases they didn’t need to suffer from,” O’Leary said.\n \n\n   \n  This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter longstanding US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has hired longtime anti-vax allies – including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was  once disciplined  by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office – to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.\n \n\n   \n  The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. In a call with state health officials Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the US status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/nigeria-christians-trump-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Nigerian Officials in Washington After Trump’s Threats of Military Action Over Violence Against Christians","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigerian officials, led by National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, are meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in Washington to address President Donald Trump’s accusations that Christianity in Nigeria faces an existential threat.

Landau will meet with the delegation on Friday, a State Department spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what exactly Hegseth’s meeting will focus on, though sources told CNN there has been a willingness from Nigeria to work with the US military more closely. Hegseth also spoke with the head of US Africa Command, Gen. Dagvin Anderson, on Wednesday, a US official said, though it was also unclear if that conversation was directly related to Hegseth’s meeting on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A senior State Department official described the Nigerian delegation as “very high level.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re committed to having those frank conversations with Nigerian officials,” the official said, noting that labeling Nigeria as a country of particular concern has “gotten the Nigerian officials’ attention.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken with his counterparts in Nigeria, the senior State Department official said, and there are also plans for trips to Nigeria.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re happy to partner with them. We’re not saying good luck. We’re saying, we want to help you make your country safer for religious communities of all stripes, not just Christians, not just Muslims, whoever it may be,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  And while Nigeria has long had a military-level relationship with the US, some sources indicated Trump’s social media post saying he would send the US “guns-a-blazing” into the West African nation to protect Christians has brought about new urgency to the relationship.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a willingness to work with the US from the Nigerians,” a source familiar with the situation told CNN, “and US Africa Command will clearly and happily work as a partner with whatever African nation is willing to work with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  As the visit to Washington has been underway by the Nigerian officials this week, Mike Waltz, US ambassador to the United Nations, and rapper Nicki Minaj spoke about the “deadly threats faced by thousands of Christians in Nigeria,” during  a UN event Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  And on Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Africa Subcommittee held a hearing on Nigeria with State Department officials regarding the labeling of Nigeria as a country of particular concern.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-democrats-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump accuses Democratic lawmakers who urged military to disobey illegal orders of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump accused six Democratic lawmakers — including former military and intelligence officials — of seditious behavior, suggesting they should be executed for urging service members to disobey illegal orders.

disobey illegal orders of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’ \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Arlette Saenz, Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Thursday suggested that Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials  to disobey illegal orders  should be put to death, sparking an outcry among Democrats on Capitol Hill that the president was seeking to incite violence.\n \n\n   \n  “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, responding to a video from half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military and intelligence community urging people currently in those roles to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote. He also reposted several other users’ posts, including one that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”\n \n\n   \n  The comments drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who condemned Trump’s comments as an attempt to incite violence, and even drew the scrutiny of members in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally who served as a lawyer for the military reserves, said the president’s remarks were “over the top,” though he also said he considered the Democrats’ video “despicable.” And GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he didn’t think it was “really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later denied that Trump was calling for lawmakers to be executed, arguing that the members of Congress with national security backgrounds should not be encouraging anyone to defy orders from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These members knew what they were doing. They were leaning into their credentials, as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander in chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him and you can betray your oath of office,” Leavitt said. “That is a very, very dangerous message. And it perhaps is punishable by law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers in the video – Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan – vowed they “will not be intimidated.”\n \n\n   \n  “What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the lawmakers said in part.\n \n\n   \n  “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.”\n \n\n   \n  Slotkin was accompanied by USCP officers to an event in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Her team requested the additional presence from USCP for the event that took place off Capitol Hill, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n   “I think when a lion’s share of Americans understand that it is in their own power to push back on this kind of rhetoric and this kind of threat, that’s when we actually turn the tide,” she said at the event.\n \n\n   \n  Deluzio called for both parties to unite against what he called Trump’s “outrageous call for political violence.” “It’s a moment where Democrats and Republicans and everyone else in the country should condemn his calls for political violence,” he said on CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Crow, meanwhile, warned on CNN that Trump’s comments should be taken seriously. “We have to take everything that Donald Trump says seriously. He throws a lot of stuff out there, but some of the things he carries through on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the comments “an outright threat” and that Trump was “calling for the execution of elected officials.” He added from the Senate floor: “This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team said they had been in touch with law enforcement authorities to make sure lawmakers were protected.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families. Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the president’s comments, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he didn’t agree with them but dismissed the video that sparked his reaction as “unnecessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t agree with that. Obviously, everyone has their First Amendment rights. But what they did was ill-advised and provocative and unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, similarly called the video “wildly inappropriate,” as he defended Trump. Though he later conceded he wouldn’t have used the same language.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to allow others to make legal judgments about how that…the words that the President chose are not the ones that I would use, OK,” Johnson said Thursday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, I don’t think that this is…these are crimes punishable by death or any of that,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The lawmakers who posted the video that sparked Trump’s reaction did not specify which orders service members received, or might receive, that could be illegal. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said in the video, adding, “Know that we have your back. … Don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at those lawmakers’ actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat Party.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/weather/polar-vortex-cold-snowy-december-stratosphere","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-05:00","title":"A Polar Vortex Disruption Is on the Way, and Its Magnitude Is Almost Unheard of in November","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden stratospheric warming event is causing a dramatic weakening of the polar vortex in the stratosphere over the North Pole, leading to a rare and extreme polar vortex disruption in November — a time when such events are almost unheard of.

disruption is on the way, and its magnitude is almost unheard of in November \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  High above the North Pole, in a slice of atmosphere  rarely noticed and even less understood , a transformation is underway. Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat, and it could begin the week of Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/chadwick-boseman-hollywood-walk-of-fame","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00Z","title":"Chadwick Boseman honored with posthumous star on Hollywood Walk of Fame: ‘He was an incredible leader’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chadwick Boseman, the late actor renowned for his roles in 'Black Panther' and 'Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom', was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles on November 20, 2025.

The administration has claimed that the National Guards presence added significant preventative measure that helped decrease crime in the district.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump is well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington, DC, to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement with specific tasks,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in response to the ruling. “This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC.”\n \n\n   \n  In her ruling, Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, acknowledged the complexities of the case given “the unique constitutional position of the District of Columbia.”\n \n\n   \n  Cobb, however, said that “at its core, Congress has given the District rights to govern itself. Those rights are infringed upon when Defendants approve, in excess of their statutory authority, the deployment of National Guard troops to the District.”\n \n\n   \n  “From the beginning, we made clear that the U.S. military should not be policing American citizens on American soil,” DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement following the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This unprecedented federal overreach is not normal, or legal,” he added. “It is long past time to let the National Guard go home – to their everyday lives, their regular jobs, their families, and their children.”\n \n\n   \n  Cobb found that “the deployments at issue entail the day-to-day presence of more than 2,000 National Guard troops,” which the judge noted is about two-thirds the size of the local police force.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court finds no authority in Title 49 of the D.C. Code that supports the President’s ability to call out the (DC National Guard) to patrol the District under these circumstances,” Cobb wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “There is also the risk that this incursion may become permanent, or at least enduring, given the creation of a (DC National Guard) unit specifically established to conduct law enforcement in the District,” which the judge notes runs contrary to the statutes that govern their deployment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and comment. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:12:00-05:00","title":"Child Missing, Mother Uncooperative: What May Happen Next in Melodee Buzzard Case?","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after being last seen with her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, on a cross-country road trip from California to Nebraska.

In all, the set of circumstances has raised serious red flags about Melodee’s well-being and about potential criminal wrongdoing for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Still, investigators have not charged Buzzard with a crime related to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  So, what gives?\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just not, ‘A kid’s missing. They haven’t been seen. Let’s arrest the mother,’” CNN legal analyst  Joey Jackson  said of how law enforcement operates. “What are the specific factual circumstances that would make the mother responsible?”\n \n\n   \n  “In any case, you need probable cause,” he added. “Is there reason to believe that a crime was committed and the subject of the person being arrested committed it?”\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke to several legal experts and re-examined other high-profile missing children cases to better understand the potential path forward in Melodee’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office, with assistance from the FBI, has been searching for Melodee and has publicly released some information from the “critical” time period of the road trip from October 7 to 10. Still, investigators may have more evidence that has not been released to the public, making it difficult to speculate on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re waiting for is evidence if she should be charged, and if so, with what,” Los Angeles’ Loyola Law School Professor  Laurie Levenson  said. “This one is still kind of a mystery. We know something is amiss: All of the wigs, the travel, the concerns that people are showing. I think those are legitimate that something is amiss, but we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Melodee went missing last month\n \n\n   \n  The search for Melodee began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the girl had been absent for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found, officials said. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts and “has been uncooperative” with investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts has focused on her and her mother’s movements during a 1,000-mile road trip from their home in Lompoc, California, to Nebraska. On October 7, Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from a rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing wigs on October 7, the sheriff’s office said. Further, the rental car’s license plate was changed midway through the trip in what the sheriff’s office said is believed to be an attempt “to avoid detection.”\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said in a November 6 statement . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  On November 7, the sheriff’s office  announced  the mother was arrested on a felony false imprisonment charge for allegedly using a box cutter and preventing an adult man “from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  She pleaded not guilty and was released from custody with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  The charge was dismissed and her pre-trial supervision ended on Thursday after the judge did not find sufficient probable cause, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office told CNN. The hearing featured testimony from the accuser, according to  CNN affiliate KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard’s attorney, Adrian Galvan, declined to comment to CNN about the investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday night Ashlee Buzzard was “in consistent contact with investigators and they have not had any additional information that they are prepared to release.”\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when the girl was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n    The next steps in the investigation\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are likely to continue tracing the steps of the road trip as they search for physical evidence, digital communications and witnesses, legal experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is what they should be doing,” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller explained. “They are taking their time. They are being meticulous. They are building the pieces of a case that may come together if and when they do have evidence to arrest her.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Buzzard, her uncooperative stance may be frustrating for investigators, but the Fifth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to silence in an interrogation.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no legal imperative at all, under any circumstance, no matter how bad things might look for you in public opinion, for you to say anything,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Other missing children cases\n \n\n   \n  In two high-profile cases involving missing children, the parents were initially charged with lesser counts as investigators continued to search for more evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Florida mother  Casey Anthony , for one, was initially charged with child neglect, providing false statements to police and obstruction in July 2008 in the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter  Caylee Anthony . The child had last been seen a month earlier and was reported missing by her grandparents.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, in October of that year, Anthony was indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The decomposed body of her daughter was found in December 2008.\n \n\n   \n  A jury ultimately acquitted her of murder but convicted her on four counts of providing false information to police.\n \n\n   \n  Or consider the case of the Idaho mother  Lori Vallow Daybell .\n \n\n   \n  Her children, JJ and Tylee, were last seen in September 2019, and relatives raised concerns about their whereabouts two months later. In  February 2020 , Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.\n \n\n   \n  The children’s bodies were found in June 2020, and Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were then indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Both were later  convicted  of  murder  in the children’s deaths.\n \n\n   \n  How Melodee’s case will play out remains a mystery.   In the near term, investigators’ focus will remain on finding her and her well-being.\n \n\n   \n  “There are so many open questions at this point,” Levenson said. “Right now, I think the priority is probably less the charges and more finding the kid.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/illinois-immigrants-release-blocked","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00Z","title":"Appeals court blocks release of hundreds of migrants arrested in Illinois just a day before they could have left detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal appeals court in the 7th Circuit blocked the release of hundreds of migrants arrested during the Trump administration’s Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, reversing a lower court order that had required their release on $1,500 bonds. The arrests, which targeted people at Home Depots, farms, and during traffic stops, sparked widespread criticism over warrantless detentions, racial profiling, and constitutional rights violations. The 7th Circuit ruled that District Judge Jeffrey Cummings had misinterpreted the law and overstepped his authority under a consent decree banning warrantless arrests.

Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:23 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal appeals court paused the  release of hundreds of immigrants  who were arrested during the Department of Homeland Security’s aggressive immigration actions in the Chicago area earlier this year, according to a court filing Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Last Wednesday, US District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the Trump administration to release on $1,500 bond hundreds of detainees after he determined the arrests violated a local consent decree barring warrantless arrests of immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  Court records showed last Friday the Department of Justice submitted a list of more than 600 people to be assessed for release. The list showed only a fraction of those detained were considered “high risk” by federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  The list included criminal histories for just 16 defendants. Those criminal histories included convictions or arrests for aggravated assault, driving under the influence, indecent exposure, battery and enticement of a minor and kidnapping.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of the DOJ filing showed migrants arrested in the Chicago area were transferred to detention facilities as far away as Texas and Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday sided with the Trump administration to keep those on the list in custody, just one day before detainees were set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions between the Trump administration and local leaders, protesters and journalists in Chicago and Illinois have boiled over since Operation Midway Blitz got underway over the summer. The government is fighting a multi-front legal battle as groups challenge agents’  use of force  on demonstrators, treatment of media and clergy, and warrantless detentions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal immigration crackdown has drawn pushback from community members concerned about the potential for racial profiling and  constitutional rights  violations – for both documented and undocumented people – as  the mass deportation agenda  has swept up people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests at  Home Depots  and farms, outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  In its request to pause the release of migrants, the Trump administration argued Judge Cummings’ orders in the case incorrectly interpreted the law, exceeded the scope of the consent decree and the court’s “legal and equitable authority” and infringed upon the immigration officers’ ability to operate.\n \n\n   \n  Though the appeals court did not explain why it sided with the Trump administration in the detention case, its decision comes just a day after a three-judge panel with the 7th Circuit blocked  a different judge’s order  because they believed the judge had overstepped their authority by imposing strict limits on how federal agents could operate in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In that ongoing case, US District Judge Sara Ellis responded to concerns from demonstrators, clergy and media about federal agents’ escalating crowd-control methods. Ellis prohibited agents from using several types of force, issued detailed requirements for body cameras and identification, and ordered the government to produce reams of internal records.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis called the Trump administration’s claims of rampant violence and obstruction in Chicago “not credible” in a written order released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants would have people believe instead that the Chicagoland area is in a vise hold of violence, ransacked by rioters, and attacked by agitators – which justifies the unprecedented swath of indiscriminate uses of force unleashed on journalists, peaceful protestors, and religious practitioners. That narrative simply is untrue.”\n \n\n   \n  Both cases under judges Cummings and Ellis are still ongoing. The 7th Circuit will hear oral arguments in the case on migrant detentions on December 2.\n \n\n   \n  The National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead attorneys in the class-action lawsuit, said they are “deeply disappointed” by Thursday’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The Seventh Circuit stay means that Chicago-area families will face, at minimum, weeks more separation, and people will continue to languish in inhumane immigrant detention centers, at risk of deportation without due process. This is especially sad given that families already have been separated from loved ones for weeks,” the organizations said in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  Even after Judge Cummings’ order paved the way for detainees’ release, the fate of those in custody remained unclear. Several of those arrested had filed their own individual cases, and some, according to the DOJ filing, were already released.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, according to Cummings’ ruling. The judge had ordered that those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple attorneys CNN spoke with were unsure how Cummings’ ruling would impact their clients who were transferred out of Judge Cummings’ jurisdiction.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/americas/colombia-holy-grail-shipwreck-san-jose-treasures-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00Z","title":"Colombia recovers first treasures from 300-year-old ‘holy grail of shipwrecks’","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombia has successfully recovered gold, bronze coins, a porcelain cup, and a cannon from the sunken Spanish warship San José, which sank off its coast in 1708 during the War of the Spanish Succession.

Neither state’s waters have been open to new drilling for decades.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s Interior Department released a five-year offshore drilling plan on Thursday that would open up vast parts of California’s coastline to drilling, which hasn’t happened in that state since the late 1960s. The Department is also proposing new oil drilling in parts of the Eastern Gulf — located approximately 100 nautical miles off Florida’s coast — a decision opposed by Florida’s Republican leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s proposal would open the Eastern Gulf to federal oil drilling auctions starting in 2029. It would open auctions for drilling in central and southern California in 2027 and northern California in 2029.\n \n\n   \n  The oil industry has been advocating for opening up parts of the Eastern Gulf that are adjacent to areas where oil production has been happening for decades in the Central Gulf, an industry source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal is sure to be met with resistance in California. The state’s coast has not seen drilling since a devastating oil spill in 1969, which drew national attention for destroying coastal wildlife and the state’s fishing industry.\n \n\n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the plan “idiotic” in a statement and vowed the state “will use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s interesting that Donald’s proposal doesn’t include the waters off Mar-a-Lago,” Newsom said in his statement.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, Florida’s congressional delegation — including Republicans — repeatedly pushed back against attempts to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico to drilling. The first Trump administration extended the offshore drilling ban for the Eastern Gulf, rather than opening it up.\n \n\n   \n  This new Gulf action has also rankled many Florida Republicans, where memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill still shape public opinion. Molly Best, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said the governor’s office still supports the ban on drilling in the area from Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The DeSantis administration “urges the Department of Interior to reconsider,” Best said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  And a letter from several Florida Republican congressmen to the president urged the administration to withdraw the Eastern Gulf parcels, saying oil exploration there was “incompatible with military operations and recreational uses.” Among the signees is Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed candidate for governor in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Leading up to the release of Thursday’s five-year plan, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said he   believed he had assurances from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that any new drilling in the Gulf would not threaten Florida economically, environmentally or militarily, a source with knowledge of their conversation told CNN. A source close to several Republicans in Florida’s delegation told CNN officials believe the proposal honors those assurances, though congressional staff were still studying the details.\n \n\n   \n  National Ocean Industries Association president Erik Milito called the inclusion of the Eastern Gulf a “forward-looking approach” and American Petroleum Institute president Mike Sommers hailed it as a “historic step.”\n \n\n   \n  The move is part of President Donald Trump’s agenda to open up more parts of the country to drilling for fossil fuels — the oft-repeated campaign promise of “drill, baby, drill.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plan also proposes holding lease sales in the western and central Gulf of Mexico, where the vast majority of offshore drilling currently takes place. It also proposes auctioning off federal waters along almost all of Alaska’s coastline at the end of the decade and into the early 2030s.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Trump administration’s new plan, California leaders vowed to push back on the federal government’s move to open waters up to drilling, including possible legal action.\n \n\n   \n  “Time and again, President Trump has shown that his interest lies with his Big Oil friends profiting at the expense of our environment and public health,” said Christine Lee, a spokesperson for California attorney general Rob Bonta. “We won’t stand for this and are exploring our legal options.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Jared Huffman, both California Democrats, said in a joint statement that Trump’s plan “targets California and the whole West Coast because they think we will roll over.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are wrong,” Padilla and Huffman said. “We’re going to fight this with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  Given Trump’s tariffs, it’s not currently boom time for oil drilling, experts told CNN. Companies instead are trying to curb their spending and hold onto their earnings, said Tom Seng, a professor of energy finance at Texas Christian University.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the industry doesn’t have a lot going on,” Seng told CNN. “We certainly have a pro-fossil fuel administration. They’re going to streamline things for us, but the marketplace will always dictate activity.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Seng said, some oil exploration companies will likely want to “take advantage of the lease offerings,” with an eye towards the long-term future.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, when will they deploy the capital to actually drill on the leases?” he said. “There won’t be a rush to do so. $60 oil won’t help.”\n \n\n   \n  Environmental groups said the plan would pose a threat to marine life and oceanside communities around the country.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft plan is an oil spill nightmare,” said Oceana campaign director Joseph Gordon. “The last thing America needs now is a massive expansion of offshore drilling that could shut down our shores with catastrophic oil spills.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken in recent days and weeks to expand oil drilling around the country. The Interior Department this week announced it was rolling back a Biden-era rule that had banned fossil fuel drilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, over 13 million acres.\n \n\n   \n  And environmental groups sounded the alarm as oil company ConocoPhillips proposed more oil drilling exploration in Alaska, including drilling four new exploratory wells in the NPRA. The company is currently developing the massive Willow project in NPRA where it expects to start producing oil by 2029. Willow was approved by former President Joe Biden in a move that roiled the Democratic president’s base.\n \n\n   \n  “The public deserves the right to have a say on what happens on these critically important public lands in the Western Arctic,” Earthjustice attorney Ian Dooley said in a recent statement. “Seismic and drilling activities can cause impacts on this sensitive ecosystem that lasts decades.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/us/melodee-buzzard-disappearance-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:37:00-05:00","title":"A timeline of 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s disappearance and her mother’s arrest","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melodee Buzzard, a 9-year-old girl from Lompoc, California, went missing on October 14, 2025, after being absent from school for several days.

Melodee Buzzard’s disappearance and her mother’s arrest \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wolfe, Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:37 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the 9-year-old had been absent for a prolonged time.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focusing on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska and closely examining the actions of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard was initially charged with a felony in an incident involving an unrelated different person, but the charge has since been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest and dismissal of false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.” Buzzard faced a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated.

The co-conspirator claimed that the attackers referred to Greene by name and knew that she worked in Van Drew’s office.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not mention Van Drew by name in the complaint, calling him “Federal Official 1,” but the congressman’s office told CNN that Greene was once employed in his office.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s attorney said in a statement to CNN, “At the age of 26, my client served her community working full time to assist the constituents of the Congressman with loyalty and fidelity.

Two messages were written in black marker on her body: “TRUMP WHORE” on her stomach and Van Drew “IS RACIST” on her back.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said in the complaint that Greene claimed the men who allegedly attacked her said they had a gun and “threatened to shoot her.” She told authorities she was held down while the men cut her and wrote on her body.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department said the investigation revealed that Greene had paid “a body modification/scarification artist” to make the cuts to her body before the staged attack.\n \n\n   \n  FBI agents went to the artist’s studio, and according to the complaint, obtained a receipt showing Greene had paid $500 for the cuts to be made on her body.\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement officers also found zip ties similar to the ones used to bind Greene’s hands and feet, in her car, court documents said.

says \n       \n  By Kara Fox, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  United Kingdom  did “too little, too late,” in its early response to the coronavirus pandemic, leading to thousands of more deaths, the head of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry said as its latest findings were released.\n \n\n   \n  “The initial response to the pandemic was marked by a lack of information and a lack of urgency,” the inquiry’s report said, adding that “despite clear signs that the virus was spreading globally, all four nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) failed to take sufficiently timely and effective action.”\n \n\n   \n  If the UK government had introduced restrictions earlier, when the number of Covid cases was lower, mandatory lockdown could have either been shorter or avoided all together, it added.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, “this lack of urgency and the huge rise in infections made a mandatory lockdown inevitable.”\n \n\n   \n  “They had no choice by then. But, it was through their own acts and omissions that they had no choice,” said Baroness Heather Hallett, the inquiry’s chair.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, if the lockdown – which began on March 23, 2020 – had been introduced just a week earlier, at least 23,000 people would have survived, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  “The evidence suggests that the number of deaths in England alone in the first wave up until the 1st of July 2020, would have been reduced by 48%,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report, the second of 10 areas of investigation for the inquiry, was focused on how political leaders and senior officials made decisions during the pandemic. It examined the core machinery of government, the role of scientific advice, and the relationship between Westminster and the devolved nations as the crisis unfolded.\n \n\n   \n  Calling February 2020 a “lost month,” Hallett said: “The obviously escalating crisis required leadership from the very top. All four governments knew that in the reasonable worst case scenario, up to 80% of the population would be infected, with a very significant loss of life.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, rule-breaking politicians and their advisers weakened public confidence in government decisions and increased the likelihood that people would ignore restrictions, the report said, faulting all four UK nations for poor planning and decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  It said that strained relations and low trust between former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland made coordination difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s response throughout the crisis was criticized by many who said that he wasn’t taking the pandemic seriously enough.   The so-called “ Partygate ” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday, contributed to his departure as prime minister in July 2022.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a toxic and chaotic culture at the heart of the UK government …this kind of culture is detrimental to good decision making,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, which campaigned for an independent inquiry, said in a Thursday  statement  that “while it is vindicating to see Boris Johnson blamed in black and white for the catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic, it is devastating to think of the lives that could have been saved under a different prime minister.”\n \n\n   \n  “To make mistakes is human. To refuse to listen to frontline workers, vulnerable people, the insights of devolved leaders or scientific experts is unforgivable,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The report said that children were not given sufficient priority, as ministers did not fully account for the consequences of closing school and that overall, lockdown caused lasting societal harm and heightened existing inequalities.\n \n\n   \n  It did commend ministers for a successful vaccine rollout and for managing the exit from lockdown in early 2021 in a way that protected vulnerable groups.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report follows the inquiry’s initial report, published in July 2024, which delivered a stark assessment of the country’s pandemic preparedness.\n \n\n   \n  That report concluded that the UK entered the pandemic with “fatal strategic flaws” embedded in its emergency planning systems and found that government preparedness was focused almost entirely on influenza rather than respiratory viruses like Covid-19, despite international warnings.\n \n\n   \n  This narrow scenario planning meant that essential protections, such as robust PPE stockpiles, effective surveillance, and diverse expert input were all inadequate once the pandemic began, it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ten recommendations were issued, including a statutory body for emergency preparedness, regular national pandemic exercises, simplified crisis structures, and significantly improved data systems.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/science/universe-expansion-slow-down-dark-energy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:48:00Z","title":"Are astronomers wrong about dark energy?

The discovery won them a  Nobel Prize in physics in 2011 .\n \n\n   \n  However, the nature of dark energy has remained a mystery, and its role in the universe’s expansion has been called into question  before .\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a consortium of hundreds of researchers using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)   in Arizona, developed the  largest ever 3D map  of the universe. The observations hinted at the fact that dark energy may be weakening over time, indicating that the universe’s rate of expansion could eventually slow.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a study  published  November 6   in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society provides further evidence that dark energy might not be pushing on the universe with the same strength it used to.\n \n\n   \n  The DESI project’s findings last year represented “a major, major paradigm change … and our result, in some sense, agrees well with that,” said Young-Wook Lee, a professor of astrophysics at Yonsei University in South Korea and lead researcher for the new study.\n \n\n   \n  Lee and his colleagues’ work builds on the evolving understanding of dark energy, suggesting that the universe’s expansion has already started to slow down — something that could alter the fate of the universe itself. “Dark energy is there, but the present universe has already entered a decelerating phase, today,” Lee said. “So the fate of the universe could change. And if you can change the fate of the universe, that is really important progress in cosmology.”\n \n\n   \n    Aging supernovas\n \n\n   \n  To reach their conclusions, the researchers analyzed a sample of 300 galaxies containing Type 1a supernovas and posited that the dimming of distant exploding stars was not only due to their moving farther away from Earth, but also due to the progenitor star’s age.\n \n\n   \n  “Before our work, Type Ia supernovae were thought to explode with nearly identical intrinsic brightness, making them highly reliable ‘standard candles,’” said study coauthor Junhyuk Son, a doctoral candidate of astronomy   at Yonsei University. “However, we found that their luminosity actually depends on the age of the stars that produce them — younger progenitors yield slightly dimmer supernovae, while older ones are brighter.”\n \n\n   \n  Son said the team has a high statistical confidence — 99.99% — about this age-brightness relation,  allowing them to use Type 1a supernovas more accurately than before to assess the universe’s expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “If confirmed, this would represent the most significant shift in cosmology since the discovery of dark energy in 1998,” Son said. “It would suggest that the (expansion of the) universe is no longer accelerating today and that dark energy is not a constant force but something that evolves over time. This discovery would open an entirely new chapter in our understanding of the physical nature of dark energy, how it has changed throughout cosmic history, and what it ultimately means for the fate of the universe.”\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, if the expansion continues to slow down, the universe could begin to contract, ending in what astronomers imagine may be the opposite of the big bang — the  big crunch . “That is certainly a possibility,” Lee said. “Even two years ago, the Big Crunch was out of the question. But we need more work to see whether it could actually happen.”\n \n\n   \n    Extraordinary claims\n \n\n   \n  The new research proposes a radical revision of accepted knowledge, so, understandably, it is being met with skepticism.\n \n\n   \n  ”This study rests on a flawed premise,” Adam Riess, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University and one of the recipients of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics, said in an email. “It suggests supernovae have aged with the Universe, yet observations show the opposite — today’s supernovae occur where young stars form. The same idea was proposed years ago and refuted then, and there appears to be nothing new in this version.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, however, said Riess’ claim is incorrect. “Even in the present-day Universe, Type Ia supernovae are found just as frequently in old, quiescent elliptical galaxies as in young, star-forming ones — which clearly shows that this comment is mistaken. The so-called paper that ‘refuted’ our earlier result relied on deeply flawed data with enormous uncertainties,” he said, adding that the age-brightness correlation has been independently confirmed by two separate teams in the United States and China.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts in the field who were not involved with the study echoed some of Riess’ concerns. Dan Scolnic, an associate professor of physics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, noted that the study makes a leap from host galaxy age to supernova age that isn’t physically justified. “The authors are proposing ideas that the community has already tested and corrected for with much larger data sets. The universe is still accelerating just fine,” Scolnic said.\n \n\n   \n  Dillon Brout, an assistant professor in the departments of astronomy and physics of Boston University, pointed out via email that the paper raises a fair question about how the ages of supernova progenitors change over cosmic time, adding that it is always important to challenge our way of thinking in order to a better understand of the universe. “However, the way they model that evolution is not supported by observations nor by our understanding of how these systems form. Modern supernova analyses already account for the connection between brightness and the environments where these stars originate, which captures most of the effect they discuss,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Dragan Huterer, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an email, noting that he does not feel the new research “rises to the threshold to overturn the currently favored model.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee is aware that the work might be controversial. “We have a long way to go to convince everyone in the supernova cosmology community,” he said. “There are still many people who are strongly against (our results), so a lot of debate and discussions should happen in the near future.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, more clarity on the issue might be around the corner. The new  Vera C. Rubin Observatory , which started operating this year, is set to help settle the debate with the early 2026 launch of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, an ultrawide and ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the universe made by scanning the entire sky every few nights over 10 years to capture a compilation of asteroids and comets, exploding stars, and distant galaxies as they change.\n \n\n   \n  “Vera Rubin will discover more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies with very high-precision age measurement,” Lee said. “It will take three or five years, and it will allow a more direct cosmological test without worrying about this age bias effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dark energy is getting weirder and weirder,” Lee concluded. “But there is no good theory that can explain this very weird behavior. So I think we are missing something. Maybe, in five years, an even more surprising result can come up.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/ups-plane-crash-ntsb-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:40:00Z","title":"NTSB Releases Frame-by-Frame Images of Engine Separating During Deadly UPS Crash in Louisville","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fatal crash of UPS Flight 2976, a 34-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-11F jet, occurred during takeoff at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on November 4, 2025, killing all three pilots and 11 people on the ground.

earlier this month failed only moments after the doomed flight broke ground, according to a new report from the National Transportation Safety Board\n \n\n   \n  The report includes stunning frame-by-frame photos of the left engine of three-engined McDonnell Douglas MD-11F separating from the plane and going up and over the wing and igniting a fireball seen in a sequence of six extraordinary new images obtained by investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The three pilots of UPS flight 2976 and 11 people on the ground  were killed  when the beleaguered jet sliced a half-mile long debris field across a petroleum recycling facility and UPS warehouse, setting off a massive blaze of fire and black smoke visible for miles.\n \n\n   \n  The report highlights fatigue cracks found in the hardware attaching the engine to the wing and symptoms of over-stressing, but more is still to come as the agency conducts its full investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS freighter was a 34-year-old jet and had been in the process of being phased out by the cargo carrier.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Aviation Administration ultimately  grounded  all MD-11 and MD-11F aircraft until each underwent a thorough inspection. UPS has 26 other MD-11s in their fleet, a company spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The engine and other faulty parts\n \n\n   \n  Investigators who combed the runway shortly after the crash said they recovered and cleaned hardware from the scene—a pair structural fittings which kept the engine pylon snug to the wing. The fittings—known as lugs—showed signs of fatigue cracking and over-stressing, evidenced by “their 2 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions,” investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The report also lays out a new timeline of the crash sequence along with new data which showed the plane failed to climb higher than 30 feet above Runway 17 Right at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  A witness in the control tower reported the takeoff speed appeared normal for the type of aircraft, but the climb was not. Another witness said the plane stopped climbing and began to lose altitude before rolling to the left, the preliminary report said.\n \n\n   \n  The MD-11 is equipped with three engines: one on each wing and one on the tail. The plane went through some previous maintenance in San Antonio that put it out of commission for six weeks, investigators said. All service records will be reviewed.\n \n\n   \n  The left and right engines of the plane are attached to the underside of pylons that are attached to each wing.\n \n\n   \n    Investigators are still gathering more information\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have also been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorder contained two hours and four minutes of “good quality digitally recorded audio,” Inman previously said. The flight data recorder contained 63 hours of data that spanned over 24 flights, including the accident, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  In a rare move, the NTSB drew a parallel to a previous disaster—the 1979 crash of American Airlines Flight 191, in Chicago which killed 271 on board and two on the ground. The plane involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the forerunner to the MD-11.\n \n\n   \n  During that plane’s takeoff rotation, the left engine, pylon assembly and about three feet of the leading edge of the left wing separated from the plane and fell onto the runway. The plane rolled to the left and crashed.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple specialists in varying factors were deployed to investigate including experts   in air traffic control, human performance, aircraft performance and more.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the 12-pages of new findings were published just more than two weeks since the November 4 crash, significantly faster than the NTSB’s typical 30-day timeline to put out a preliminary report.\n \n\n   \n  “We appreciate the National Transportation Safety Board’s prompt release of preliminary findings and will fully support the investigation through its conclusion,” UPS said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Boeing, which long ago merged with the planes original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, said, “We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  A final report from the NTSB is expected in 18 to 24 months detailing the probable causes of the crash.

the economy in sharp departure from Trump’s rhetoric \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:16 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance on Thursday acknowledged that the Trump administration faces growing  skepticism over its economic record , issuing a plea for patience ahead of what he predicted would be an eventual “economic boom.”\n \n\n   \n  “We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do,” Vance said during a Breitbart News event. “As much progress as we’ve made, it’s going to take a little time for Americans to feel that.”\n \n\n   \n  The conciliatory tone represented a sharply different approach from the one taken in recent weeks by President Donald Trump, who has  continued to insist  that the economy is thriving while dismissing cost-of-living concerns as little more than a Democratic talking point.\n \n\n   \n  It also underscored the White House’s ongoing efforts to calibrate its messaging on the economy ahead of next year’s midterm elections — and in the  aftermath of GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginia   earlier this month that voters indicated were driven in large part by deep disappointment with Trump’s domestic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Vance during his remarks conceded that Americans remained unhappy over the affordability issues that have weighed on those approval ratings, such as the  price of groceries . At one point, he went as far as to undercut one of Trump’s key barometers of economic success — a decline in the price of eggs since January — by admitting that the food staple is still too expensive for many people.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an American who’s just struggling to get by, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you want your kids to have good opportunities. And then the price of eggs goes from $2 a dozen to $8 a dozen under the Biden administration, and then it goes from $8 a dozen to maybe $6.50 a dozen,” Vance said. “Well, to you that is still a major problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president sought to cast much of the blame for voters’ sour mood on former President Joe Biden, complaining that the prior administration had “put us in a very tough spot.” He also blamed Democrats for any near-term economic fallout from the record-long  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  “I do think that actually pumped the brakes a little bit on all the economic news that we’re seeing,” Vance said of the shutdown. “That’s going to cause a little bit of damage.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also celebrated a  stronger-than-expected September jobs report  released earlier on Thursday, calling it evidence that Trump’s policies were working.\n \n\n   \n  Yet he allowed that the Trump administration still has plenty of work to do to convince voters that those policies stand to benefit them, departing from the president’s preferred approach of touting his agenda as an unqualified success.\n \n\n   \n  At a US-Saudi Investment Forum a day earlier, Trump dismissed the focus on affordability, calling it a “new word” that Democrats have latched on to since he took office.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that we’re going up in is our stock market, okay, we’re bringing prices down,” Trump said, despite the rise in the cost of key products like  beef and coffee  that economists have blamed at least in part on the administration’s tariffs. “But they came up with a new word that they’re using: affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  The president in speeches and social media posts since Democrats’ electoral victories earlier this month has also called affordability concerns a “con job,” urging voters to credit him for falling gasoline prices and an inflation rate that’s come down from its Biden-era peak — but begun over the last several months to slowly climb once again.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has floated a range of initiatives aimed at reining in the cost of living despite Trump’s insistence that prices are falling, including rolling back tariffs on hundreds of products and raising the prospect of sending $2,000 checks to Americans at some point next year. Trump is  also expected to step up domestic travel  in the coming months focused on promoting his economic agenda, as aides try to boost voter awareness of the administration’s accomplishments.\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides are also planning to  pitch a new health reform plan  ahead of the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies amid GOP fears that the party will pay a hefty political price if voters’ health insurance costs skyrocket.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has offered few details about what that plan will look like. Though Vance on Thursday claimed the eventual proposal would get bipartisan support, he did not provide specifics.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also offered few new strategies for ushering in the booming economy that he said “we really do believe is coming,” arguing only that the administration needed a bit more time to realize its goals.\n \n\n   \n  “The thing I’d ask from the American people is to ask for a little bit of patience,” Vance said. “We just gotta keep it going.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/inflation-polls-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Polls show Trump’s happy talk on inflation is falling flat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Polling data reveals a growing gap between President Donald Trump’s claims of low or non-existent inflation and public reality.

Trump set about falsely  claiming prices were actually down , that there is “almost no inflation,” and that everything was more or less hunky dory.\n \n\n   \n  It  was bizarre , even from a president who often seems to reside in his own elaborately crafted alternate reality.\n \n\n   \n  And it appears to be falling flat.\n \n\n   \n  New polling conducted since Trump began driving this message shows Americans continue to see things very differently than Trump has cast them. And their reviews of his economic stewardship appear to actually be getting worse.\n \n\n   \n    75% plus say grocery prices are up, despite Trump’s repeat claims\n \n\n   \n  “Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down,” Trump said November 6. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” he said at another point. He added last week that grocery prices were “already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”\n \n\n   \n  But just 12% of Americans said grocery prices have gone down over the last six months, according to a new  Marquette University Law School poll  conducted November 5 through 12.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, 75% said they’ve gone up.\n \n\n   \n  (Average grocery prices were indeed  up roughly 1.4%  in September compared to when  Trump took office in January, and the 0.6% jump in one month from July to August was the largest in three years.)\n \n\n   \n  Even among Republicans, only 2 in 10 subscribed to Trump’s alternate version of reality in which prices are actually dropping. A majority said prices are up.\n \n\n   \n  The numbers were similar in a Fox News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  That poll, conducted November 14 to 17, showed 85% of registered voters  said grocery prices are higher than a year ago, with 60% saying they’ve “increased a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  Around two-thirds or more also said the prices of utilities, healthcare and housing were up.\n \n\n   \n  (“A year ago” technically includes two months in which Trump was not yet president, but it stands to reason people perceived the question as being mostly about his tenure.)\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking: The percentage who say grocery prices are up “a lot” (60%) is significantly higher than the percentage who said that about groceries and everyday items back in October 2021 (43%). This despite inflation back then having been about double what it is today.\n \n\n   \n  That suggests this problem is really ingrained – and will be difficult for Trump to defeat with happy talk.\n \n\n   \n    The chasm between Trump’s claims and Americans’ views of inflation\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed there is “virtually no inflation,” “almost no inflation” and said inflation is “almost nonexistent.” He has also said “we don’t have any inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, inflation has remained stubborn throughout Trump’s tenure and is at about 3% on an annualized basis – right where it was when he took over.\n \n\n   \n  And the perception might be even worse.\n \n\n   \n  52% of registered voters  said inflation was “not at all” under control, according to the Fox poll. That includes nearly two-thirds of independents (65%).\n \n\n   \n  Fewer than 2 in 10 overall – and only one-third of Republicans – said inflation was at least “mostly” under control.\n \n\n   \n    Trump blames Joe Biden; the public doesn’t\n \n\n   \n  To the extent Trump has allowed that there are economic pains, he’s generally cast them as remnants of the Biden era.\n \n\n   \n  “Biden was a disaster with affordability,” Trump told Fox News shortly after the election. He added: “When I took over, it was a mess.”\n \n\n   \n  But this, too, appears to be a losing argument.\n \n\n   \n  The Fox News poll asked whether Trump or Biden were more responsible for the current economy, and voters  chose Trump, 62%-32%.\n \n\n   \n  Only around half of Republicans (53%) blamed Biden.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s numbers appear to be getting worse\n \n\n   \n  The gamble for Trump in pitching this alternate reality is evident: If people don’t ultimately subscribe to it, they might come to view Trump as out of touch and  not taking the problem seriously enough.\n \n\n   \n  Already,  CBS News-YouGov polling  has shown 75% of Americans and a majority of Republicans have said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices.\n \n\n   \n  And indeed, it seems Trump is doing himself no favors right now. If anything, his political picture on the economy and affordability is worsening:\n \n\n   \n  The same poll shows Americans say by about a 2-to-1 margin that they expected Trump’s policies will continue to increase inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Trump has given people plenty of reason to attach whatever happens with the economy to him. That’s what happens when you rock the economy with a series of unilateral global tariffs that weren’t even endorsed by Republicans in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump voluntarily took ownership of the economy. Now he wants to disclaim the reality of what’s followed.\n \n\n   \n  Political analysts love to mine Trump’s actions for secret political strategy and three-dimensional chess moves. But this seems more like desperation than anything else.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/soccer-ncaa-washington-huskies-mia-hamant","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Women’s college soccer team wins conference championship just 3 days after its beloved goalie died","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The University of Washington women’s soccer team won the Big Ten tournament championship on November 9, 2025, in a penalty shootout just three days after the death of their beloved goalkeeper, Mia Hamant, who had been battling stage 4 kidney cancer.

just 3 days after its beloved goalie died \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:35 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The aftermath of a  penalty shootout  is always emotional.\n \n\n   \n  One team will be joyfully exuberant, celebrating a victory wrought from the most nerve-wracking tension. That ecstasy will often be peppered with relief because things rarely go perfectly in a shootout. But for the other side, there is only dejection and heartbreak; it’s cruel to come so close to winning and lose.\n \n\n   \n  On November 9 in the Big Ten tournament championship game, it would have been hard to guess the result just from looking at the University of Washington’s  women’s soccer  players. They hugged each other tight, and some were weeping on their knees as they processed both a win and a loss: Just three days before the final, beloved goalkeeper Mia Hamant had died.\n \n\n   \n  Hamant had been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive form of stage 4 kidney cancer in April, upending her soccer dream for her senior season. But as she was tossed into a desperate fight for her life, Hamant remained an integral part of the team, both in the locker room and as their biggest cheerleader on the sidelines for home games. She was also ready to contribute on FaceTime when they were on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to perfectly describe her because Mia was Mia,” the Huskies head coach Nicole Van Dyke told  CNN Sports , adding: “If I didn’t start with her being an exceptional goalkeeper, she might be upset.”\n \n\n   \n  Last season, Hamant’s save percentage ranked her as one of the top three goalkeepers in the college game, but she was valued for so much more than her ability to stop shots.\n \n\n   \n  “She was strong, resilient, an exceptional teammate,” Van Dyke continued. “She was funny, she just regularly kept us laughing, she always brought people with her. She brought us so much joy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamant documented her fight against cancer on her Instagram page,  @miakickscancer , and she maintained regular contact with the coaches while helping develop some of the players in the team, particularly this season’s sophomore goalkeeper Tanner Ijams.\n \n\n   \n  “She was probably my biggest role model and definitely my biggest inspiration going into this season,” Ijams told CNN Sports. “You could just see how incredibly strong she was throughout all of this because you could tell how much pain she was in and we all knew that she was dealing with this insane battle of her life, and yet she was still laughing with us.”\n \n\n   \n  But on November 6, the laughter stopped. The Huskies had just beaten Wisconsin in their semifinal match when they learned that they had lost their friend and teammate.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something no one’s prepared for,” explained Van Dyke, “Fortunately, we were surrounded by friends and family, and I know that’s what Mia and Mia’s family wanted for us. To be together in that moment, we’re unbelievably grateful for that.”\n \n\n   \n  They all spent the next day together, united by grief as they tried to make sense of their loss without somebody who would usually be on hand to lift their spirits.\n \n\n   \n  On a team outing to Target, they bought pajamas and candles, and at Chick-fil-A, they drank milkshakes. The next day, on the eve of the final, the senior players were asked whether they should even take the field against Michigan State. The players looked quizzically at their coach, incredulous that they were even having the conversation, but she had to be sure: Was carrying on what they all wanted to do?\n \n\n   \n  “I know she would be up there making fun of us for being so sad,” Ijams recalled. “We knew that she would want us to go out in that finals match and crush them. So, that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  The players could sense Hamant everywhere around the stadium that day, they listened to her playlist in the locker room and they couldn’t help thinking of her when a sunset, which she so admired, glowed in the exact orange hue of the ribbons they’d been wearing in her honor all season. Orange is known as the color of kidney cancer awareness.\n \n\n   \n  Nobody could have known it at the time, but in what would be one of Hamant’s final games for the Huskies, she was the hero. In a quarterfinal match of the Big Ten tournament last season, Washington beat Iowa in a penalty shootout and Hamant made three saves. It seemed tragically poetic that in the first game after her passing, the match against Michigan State would also be settled with spot kicks, during which the goalkeepers play an outsized role in the proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  “Mia loved penalties, and I definitely share that love with her,” Ijams said. “She would have been absolutely thrilled to go to penalties. I knew that we had already won the game before the penalties even started.”\n \n\n   \n  Channeling some of the tricks and mind games that her late teammate had taught her, Ijams imposed herself on the shootout, saving two of MSU’s first three kicks.\n \n\n   \n  There would be no need for a fourth. Washington’s penalty takers all converted, securing an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament and a chance to win the national title – a goal that the team is still chasing.\n \n\n   \n  After their successful spot kicks, each player paid their respects.\n \n\n   \n  Jadyn Holdenried lifted her jersey to reveal a t-shirt with the inscription “For Mia,” Laura Cetina kissed her orange wristband, and Alex Buck blew kisses to the heavens. By the time Julia Hüsch stepped up with the chance to finish the game, Ijams could feel the emotional dam breaking.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, my job was done because I knew she was going to put it away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When the players all rushed into each other’s arms a moment later, the emotion was palpable.\n \n\n   \n  “We felt that our love for (Mia) wasn’t going to be defined by any result,” explained Van Dyke. “We didn’t put pressure on ourselves to do it. I don’t think there was a dry eye in the stadium, or across the nation, to finish in penalties to win that game.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone was just sobbing in each other’s arms,” said Ijams, “We were just saying like, ‘Hey, we did it, like we did it for her.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/hunger-games-sunrise-first-look","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Our first look at ‘The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping’ is already a wild ride","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lionsgate has released a teaser trailer for 'The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,' a prequel set 24 years before the original events, focusing on the origin of Haymitch Abernathy, portrayed by Joseph Zada.

For transgender Americans, this year’s memorials will take on particular poignance, as the  Trump administration  and  conservative lawmakers  have  taken great strides  to restrict how they can live  publicly  and privately, while also eliminating  federal data collection  about anti-trans hate crimes and ending funding for an  LGBTQ suicide hotline .\n \n\n   \n  Since last November, at least 27 trans and nonbinary people have been killed, according to the nonprofit  Advocates for Trans Equality . The number is likely an undercount as precise data is difficult to collect, the organization notes. Some research has shown trans people are  more than four times  more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  “In many ways, in our society, trans people are made to feel invisible,” said Bahari Thomas, the advocacy group’s director of public education.\n \n\n   \n  Trans people, particularly trans youth, are also at heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the  Trevor Project . The organization notes this may be the result of a lack of social support and exposure to stigma and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  Gwendolyn Smith – one of the activists who founded Transgender Day of Remembrance – said it’s both heartening to see her community uphold what she started decades later and sobering to see them continue to experience high rates of violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s crucial, she said, to remember the “very vibrant lives” trans victims led. “That’s our humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has profiled eight trans people who died this year, focusing on the fullness of their lives rather than the tragic circumstances of their deaths. These are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Tahiry Broom, who stood ‘ten toes down’ for her values\n \n\n   \n  Tahiry Broom could show up anywhere – from a seat at a church service to a night club’s pulsing dance floor – armed with her long, painted nails, shimmery eyeshadow and colorful wigs. Then, like magic, the whole place would belong to her.\n \n\n   \n  And Patricia Bender would most likely be there, too, watching proudly.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is Tahiry Broom’s aunt, but the two grew up more like siblings. With only five years between them, Bender and Broom spent their days in Cleveland, practically inseparable.\n \n\n   \n  “When you see me, you saw her,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  Bender said she loved Broom’s fearlessness. Broom taught her to “walk into the room like you own it, every time.”\n \n\n   \n  Broom was outspoken, always standing “ten toes down” for anyone or anything she believed in, ever since she was a kid. She was a social butterfly who “could make fun out of nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Bender, who is a member of the LGBTQ community, said Broom leaned on her for support before coming into her own as a transgender woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m like, ‘Hey, you can’t worry yourself worrying about what the next person is going to feel like or what the next person is going to think, because at the end of the day, you’re killing yourself trying to make everybody else happy,’” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  She also helped Broom become more acquainted with those in Cleveland’s LGBTQ community. Bender already knew “everything and everybody” and getting to know new people “was a big thing” for Broom.\n \n\n   \n  She was outgoing. She loved everybody, and they loved her back.\n \n\n   \n  Going one to two weeks without hearing from her wasn’t cause for concern. She was independent and tended to mind her own business.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Bender’s phone began to ring and ring and ring. She hesitated to answer, sensing there may be bad news on the other end of the line.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes your phone rings and it rings different,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  When she finally answered her cousins’ FaceTime call and saw their rosy and tear-stained faces, she said she felt numb.\n \n\n   \n  Broom – visiting snowy Southfield, Michigan, at the time – had been shot and killed, less than a month before her 30th birthday.\n \n\n   \n  “My little brother, my nephews, my male cousins, I worry about them. They’ll be outside doing only God knows what,” Bender said. “Tahiry? Nobody worries about Tahiry.”\n \n\n   \n  A suspect in Broom’s death has been charged with second-degree murder and remains in custody, awaiting a trial date, according to Southfield police.\n \n\n   \n  Hearing of an arrest in Broom’s case was a “calming feeling” for Bender, but getting her justice would involve the suspect being “in a cell for the rest of his life,” she said. She and her family members keep up with the case by regularly attending the suspect’s Zoom hearings.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers and advocacy groups say Black trans women, like Broom, are disproportionately impacted by violence. Of the 372 trans victims identified by Human Rights Watch between 2013 and 2024, 73% were women of color, and 60% were Black women.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is still Broom’s “ying and yang.” Her “frick and frack.”\n \n\n   \n  Her niece might have thought introducing her to the local LGBTQ scene, being older or being her “auntie” made Bender Broom’s “savior.” But Broom, Bender said, saved her too.\n \n\n   \n  “I may be helping you in a sense or exposing you to this…and I’m helping you live your truth,” she added. “And the whole time, you think you need me. But the whole time, I needed you more.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Sydney Bishop \n \n\n   \n    Karmin Wells, a Detroit ballroom legend whose walk rivaled Naomi Campbell\n \n\n   \n  She was the “walking wonder” of Detroit’s queer ballroom scene – a nightlife runway legend whose hip-twisting strut is rumored to have put Naomi Campbell to shame. She wouldn’t hit the runway in anything less than six-inch heels, and the jangle of jewelry and sharp clack of her heels announced her presence almost everywhere she went.\n \n\n   \n  She was Karmin Wells – nothing more and nothing less.\n \n\n   \n  “Her style can’t be mimicked ever again,” said her aunt, Markeitha Bibb. “When she came in, they knew what it is. They knew she was (going to) take the stage.”\n \n\n   \n  The 37-year-old was a staple of the local ballroom community, a historic queer subculture where performers compete in categories that include modeling, dancing and “voguing.” Often, performers compete as members of a “house,” a chosen family that can provide a support system that biological families sometimes cannot.\n \n\n   \n  Wells had worked the stage for years, eventually earning the status of “legend” and becoming the mother of the Detroit chapter of the internationally-renowned House of Revlon.\n \n\n   \n  Monica Hudson met Wells when she was still a teenager. Hudson had been doing LGBTQ community outreach at the city’s Palmer Park when she came across Wells and was instantly charmed by her witty sense of humor.\n \n\n   \n  “Our interaction was so real and so raw and authentic. She ended up becoming my chosen daughter,” Hudson said. When Wells was killed on May 25, Hudson said it felt like “losing a part of myself.”\n \n\n   \n  Wells was shot to death in her home just days before her 38th birthday. Police say the suspect has not been identified or charged.\n \n\n   \n  “The world lost a talented, funny, loving, caring, hardworking hustler. The world has lost a gem,” said Hudson.\n \n\n   \n  She cared deeply for her grandfather, Willie Bibb, and her younger sister, Kimari Howard, her aunt said. And she had formed her own sprawling family of chosen children – younger people she mentored and uplifted, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever you gave her, she gave it back to you 10 times,” said Marcel Goudeaux-Stanley, Wells’ close friend and former significant other. “You could never outdo her. She had a really, really big heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Never staying in one place for long, Wells’ suitcase seemed to always be packed. She would leave Michigan at a moment’s notice, traveling to Las Vegas to hit the casinos or to Atlanta to compete in balls, Bibb said. Then, she would show up on her aunt’s doorstep, insisting they go out to Gigi’s or the Woodward, popular LGBTQ bars in Detroit.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always on the go. She’s always hustling,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  But Wells found peace in small ways: through morning devotionals to God, performing alone in the privacy of her living room, and finding the company of those who knew who she was when the aura of entertainment wore off, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “When she’s around people that she loves, that genuinely love her, and when she can be comfortable and she can rest, that’s where she’s genuinely happy,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Lia Smith, a curious student athlete and formidable board game opponent\n \n\n   \n  For her parents, Lia Smith’s birth was a dream come true – albeit a little nerve-racking.\n \n\n   \n  Born early at just over 31 weeks and under 4 pounds, Smith arrived just minutes before her twin (a fact she would later point out with pride to her “baby” sister). Her father, Greg Smith, camped out in the NICU for weeks until he and his husband, Keith, were able to take the babies home to meet their other child.\n \n\n   \n  “We were just thrilled beyond belief,” Greg Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  Smith grew into a healthy child and young adult who was deeply empathetic, “intrinsically curious and very hardworking,” her father said.\n \n\n   \n  She filled her days learning piano and trombone, going to swim practice, poring over books on world history, and playing board games and cards with her family. Exceptional with numbers and problem-solving, she eventually learned how to count cards and maximize her odds of winning.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I learned to only play games of pure chance with her if I wanted to win,” Smith said at his daughter’s   memorial service earlier this month. “Simply put, she was smarter than me.”\n \n\n   \n  Diving became a “core part of her existence,” he said. At age 8, Smith began training with Stanford’s youth swim program, and by the time she left home for college, her bedroom walls were decorated with hundreds of competition ribbons.\n \n\n   \n  Though she was recruited by several colleges to compete on their men’s teams, she was delighted to be invited to compete on the women’s team at Middlebury College in Vermont, her father said.\n \n\n   \n  It would be the first time she would compete on a team that aligned with her identity. After her first year at Middlebury, Smith stopped competing in diving but continued to practice with the team.\n \n\n   \n  “She was really more focused on being one of the girls,” Smith said. “It was very affirming, and mostly she just wanted to hang out with them and practice.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Smith returned to Middlebury as a senior, working towards degrees in statistics and computer science. The 21-year-old was somehow able to find time to pursue other interests as well.\n \n\n   \n  “She loved to debate the history of Japan or think about the intricacies of China. She had a keen and eclectic interest, and it made it always fun and interesting to talk to her.”\n \n\n   \n  Though she loved to spend time with family and friends, she was at her core an introvert. In her cherished private moments, she would read, sit down at the piano, or write poetry, which she rarely shared.\n \n\n   \n  But while Lia was deeply loved, her father Greg said at her memorial that she “lived on a daily basis with the quiet whispers of judgment and the furrowed brows of contempt.”\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Lia was reported missing. After a days-long search, her body was found near the college campus. She had died by suicide.\n \n\n   \n  Lia did not leave a note explaining why she killed herself, but her father noted that she had felt the brunt of cultural backlash against transgender people, a feeling he said was only exacerbated by online harassment and  a parade of restrictions  on transgender people under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I believe the relentless negativity exhausted her,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of people attended memorial services at Middlebury and at Smith’s high school, her father said. He was stricken by the “infinite love” shared at the services and the outpouring of support he has received from strangers online.\n \n\n   \n  “She was perfect for us in every way,” he said. “We cherished her, and others did, too.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Amyri Dior, a mother figure with a musical soul\n \n\n   \n  Even though Amyri Dior didn’t have children, she was like a mother to all. She guided and cared for her loved ones in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, deeply. And when it came to her family and friends’ children, she didn’t play around — she looked after them like her own.\n \n\n   \n  “My child, her friend’s children, she would claim them as her kids,” Alejandra Rederford, Dior’s cousin and best friend, said. “Always giving. She will give her last, even if it’s her last … Amyri was a good, caring, genuine soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Dior also “didn’t discriminate” when it came to music and had a passion for singing, rapping and dancing. Rederford said sometimes she would sing while Dior rapped on the spot. Through giggles, she also recalled a memory of Dior dancing in a parking lot once to the sound of a car alarm.\n \n\n   \n  “She would try to hype the people around her to dance,” Rederford said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would write her own songs, her grandmother, Carrie Joyner, remembered.\n \n\n   \n  “She sang her own music from her own voice. She loved singing with such character,” Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would also take the time to have deep conversations with Rederford and others about her experience as a trans woman. She was confident in her identity, even if some people didn’t accept her.\n \n\n   \n  Rederford and Joyner also highlighted Dior’s immense strength, living in foster care as a child for eight years before ultimately running away to her grandma’s house.\n \n\n   \n  Dior and Rederford were only a year apart, and mid-February was always a special time, with their birthdays on February 15 on February 21, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  On Dior’s 23rd birthday this year, they celebrated with a house party full of food and drinks. Dior sang along to songs she loved while laughing with her friends and family.\n \n\n   \n  Just seven days later, the two were supposed to be celebrating Rederford’s birthday together. While Rederford was still getting dressed, she answered a phone call, thinking it was Dior ready to be picked up for the night of festivities. Instead, the voice on the other line was her aunt, telling her Dior had been shot.\n \n\n   \n  A man has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in Dior’s death, according to a criminal complaint from the Milwaukee District Attorney’s office obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “She was a shining soul,” Rederford said. “She was really loved. Everywhere she (went), she was loved.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Taylor Galgano \n \n\n   \n    Kelsey Elem, who was chasing her dream of modeling\n \n\n   \n  Kelsey Elem’s smile could light up a room the moment she walked in, her mother, Calvenita Brock, said. She said Kelsey moved through the world with love, the kind you could feel just being around her.\n \n\n   \n  “Kelsey would give a person any and everything,” Brock said.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Greenville, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, with her mother and two brothers, Elem ran track, sang in the church choir and loved animals. Later, she joined Job Corps and received her nursing certificate, her mother said.\n \n\n   \n  Elem loved fashion. She was always dressed to impress, known for her bold style and her signature long nails. Brock said the two were very close, and Elem often turned to her for styling advice.\n \n\n   \n  “She’ll come by the house like, ‘Ma, I need to go in your closet, and I’m on my way, get me something out. I need something to wear today.’”\n \n\n   \n  Brock said she spoke to Elem daily, up until the morning of her death on April 24. She was 25 years old when she was fatally shot. The suspect, whom Brock has identified as one of Elem’s friends, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree domestic assault and armed criminal action.\n \n\n   \n  The day before her death, Elem posted on Facebook about how proud she was of her transition journey and how happy she was with life.\n \n\n   \n  “She fought to be the woman and the queen that she were,” Brock said. Elem strove to show other trans people “that they didn’t have to have shame, they didn’t have to feel unloved, because, you know, some people’s … loved ones don’t accept them, and Kelsey was there to let them know, because I accepted my child.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time of her death, she was traveling around the US as a model, building a dream she had long imagined.\n \n\n   \n  “She been traveling all around and so she kept telling me, ‘Mom, you got to come on,’” Brock said. “So she told me, ‘Well, I’m (going to) make sure I do all this for you, Ma, you wanted to do all this, and you stopped for us.’”\n \n\n   \n  She was laid to rest on May 9 in a red, pink, white and green casket adorned with photos of her and the words “goodbyes are not forever.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Amanda Jackson \n \n\n   \n    Sam Nordquist, who dreamed of buying a log cabin filled with animals\n \n\n   \n  A man so kind he would give you the shirt off his back.\n \n\n   \n  That’s how Linda Nordquist describes her son Sam. His kindness permeated every part of his life, from the patient demeanor he assumed at his job caring for vulnerable adults to the loving care he showed his pet cats and lizards, or the way he showered his young nieces and nephews with affection. On drives around Minneapolis, Nordquist would often buy extra food to hand out to the homeless, his sister, Kayla Nordquist, said.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist’s confidence blossomed after he transitioned, his sister said, buoyed by a close-knit and deeply supportive family. His mother helped administer his testosterone shots and carefully emptied his surgical drains after he got top surgery. Although transgender identity was new to her, “Sam is still Sam to me, and I loved Sam no matter what,” his mother said.\n \n\n   \n  He was close with his family, often jetting off for road trips with his sister and her children or binging true crime shows together. He lived with his mother, and they built a familiar routine: sharing a cigarette before work, walking the dog together, and making plans for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Last September, their routine ended when Nordquist traveled to upstate New York to meet a woman he had met online. Nordquist was tortured to death in early February, according to New York State Police. Seven people have been indicted on murder charges for their involvement. He was 24. Authorities have said there is no evidence of a hate crime but said Nordquist was treated “like a dog” before his death: beaten, assaulted, sexually abused, starved, and held captive for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart is shattered,” his sister said. Kayla Nordquist said she still wakes up every day wanting to text her brother. For his mother, “life will never be the same. Life will never be normal as we used to know it.”\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist had big aspirations, his family said: He dreamed of buying a log cabin, filled with animals. His mother wishes most of all she could have seen Nordquist find “actual true love.” It stings, she said, that she’ll never see her son get married or have children.\n \n\n   \n  In Minnesota, Nordquist’s family is dedicated to keeping his memory alive as they brace for their first holiday season without him. His sister had a portrait of him tattooed on her arm, and both his sister and mother got tattoos of “8,995,” the number of days Nordquist was alive. For Christmas, his mother is decorating the tree with ornaments adorned with her son’s name.\n \n\n   \n  His mother has taken responsibility for his cat, who sometimes wakes her up scratching at the door of Nordquist’s room, which she’s left untouched since he was killed. His sister, meanwhile, took in his bearded dragon – and she’s found herself caring for the lizard just as lovingly as Nordquist did, decorating its tank for Halloween and Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist “was the most gentle, kindest, sweetest person that you’ll probably ever meet,” his mother said. “And the world should know that they’re all missing out on him.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Zoe Sottile \n \n\n   \n    Laura Schueler, the ‘Beyonce of Cincinnati’ with an eye for consignment shopping\n \n\n   \n  Laura Schueler was the friend you could call for anything.\n \n\n   \n  De’Whitney Hankins said she would text Schueler for help with outfit choices because she trusted her fashion instincts. Schueler, a transgender woman, was known for wearing trendy furs, jackets, shoes and purses often purchased from consignment shops, Hankins said. Her edgy style prompted some in their circle of friends to call Schueler the “Beyonce of Cincinnati,” Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was very much outgoing,” said Hankins, a transgender woman who befriended Schueler in the 1990s when they were living in the same neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  But the light Schueler brought to others— along with her fun, selfless and caring spirit— darkened when she was  shot and killed on June 7  in Cincinnati, Hankins said. Schueler was 47. A 19-year-old man was arrested on July 11 in connection with her death and charged with murder, felonious assault, among other charges, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said Schueler was confident and secure with herself, which inspired many others in the transgender community. She cared deeply about her family, including her nieces and nephews, Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was not a taker,” Hankins said. “She was more of a giver. If you were hungry, she would give you money or take you to get something to eat. And she would give you the clothes off her back.”\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said she believes Schueler was targeted because she was a transgender woman and her death was a hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot of love to give, and we still had stuff to do,” Hankins said. “My heart is empty.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Nicquel Terry Ellis \n \n\n   \n    Dream Johnson, whose animated personality was made for reality TV\n \n\n   \n  When she began her transition three years ago, Iris Terrell’s daughter chose a new name for herself, one that her mother said fit her perfectly: Dream.\n \n\n   \n  “Dream wanted to be a superstar one day,” said Terrell.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson thought her big, confident personality would be perfect for a reality show and wanted to be on TV, Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a beautiful soul and would always, always keep you laughing,” her mother said. “She was the life of the party.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s aunt, Vanna Terrell, said her niece’s desire to be in the spotlight even extended to their holiday gatherings.\n \n\n   \n  “We would say we’re going to color coordinate, and Dream would go outside the box and wear something totally different,” Vanna laughs. “We would have a family function, and she would dress like Diana Ross.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s mother and aunt say the family supported her transition and credit Dream’s closest friends for helping her find her own new style.\n \n\n   \n  “They were pushing her to come out of her shell – to be whoever she wanted to be,” Vanna Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “I know for a fact that her friends are definitely going through the hardest time now because they stayed together,” she adds.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s life was cut short in July at the age of 28 when she was shot four times on a sidewalk in her hometown of Washington, DC, in a residential neighborhood about two miles from the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  According to a court document, witnesses say Dream got into an argument with a group of strangers mocking her and calling her “a boy” and a slur used to attack the LGBTQ community.\n \n\n   \n  Although surveillance footage showed Johnson never physically attacked anyone, according to police, a member of the group allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot her to death. She was unarmed,  prosecutors say .\n \n\n   \n  The suspect is charged with first-degree murder, and the case is classified as a gender identity hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  Although the allegation that Dream was targeted for being transgender is painful to her family, they also feel it is important that the reality of the crime be recognized.\n \n\n   \n  “We were pushing for that. We wanted the hate crime (charge),” Vanna said. “We needed the world to know that this is still out here.”\n \n\n   \n  That kind of hate was something Johnson never had to worry about at home.\n \n\n   \n  “I told her she was kind. She was beautiful,” said Johnson’s mother. “Can’t no one change you from being you, and don’t let no one change you.”\n \n\n   \n  Iris Terrell keeps Johnson’s positive spirit even through the sadness surrounding her death, but said the holidays will be hard this year.\n \n\n   \n  But despite her family’s tragedy, Iris Terrell only has   happy memories of her daughter and the person she became.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one thing that I loved about her – that she was herself.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andy Rose \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/dick-cheney-funeral-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:55:00-14:00","title":"Bush, Biden and former vice presidents honor Dick Cheney, while Trump, Vance snubbed for funeral invitation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney, held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., was a bipartisan gathering of former political leaders, including President Joe Biden, former President George W.

Notably, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance were not invited, highlighting the growing political divide—especially given Cheney's later public criticism of Trump. Cheney, known for his role in the Iraq War and progressive social views, was remembered for his integrity, mentorship, and principled political conduct.

Vance said Thursday that the former vice president was “a guy who served his country,” and wished his family “all the best in this moment of grieving.” Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney received full military honors at the invitation-only memorial service at Washington’s National Cathedral. Former Presidents Joe Biden and George W. Bush and former first ladies Jill Biden and Laura Bush attended as well as former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle.\n \n\n   \n  Bush eulogized his former vice president as a consummate public servant who could be relied on, and who “lifted the standards” of those around him.\n \n\n   \n  “His abilities were self-evident, without need of calculation or self-promotion,” Bush said. “His talent and restraint exceeded his ego.”\n \n\n   \n  The former president recalled that Cheney was initially tapped to help him find a running mate during his 2000 presidential run. But after going over the list of names, Bush said he came to realize that Cheney himself was the best man for the job.\n \n\n   \n  The former president said Cheney rattled off a list of reasons why he should not serve as his running mate when Bush approached him with the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “I told him that, at such a moment, most in his position would have jumped at the chance, but Dick stayed detached and he analyzed it before I made my decision,” Bush said. “He insisted on giving me a complete rundown of all of the reasons I should not choose him.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney would go on to serve two terms with Bush, becoming one of the most influential and powerful vice presidents in modern history.\n \n\n   \n  Also in attendance at the memorial service were a number of Supreme Court Justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. A large number of past and present Cabinet members from both Republican and Democratic administrations were also expected, as well as congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi was present along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former leader Mitch McConnell.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, who served as Bush’s vice president from 2001 to 2009, died on November 3 at the age of 84. Prior to being elected vice president, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and as a congressman representing Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n  He was further remembered for his progressive stance on several social issues, including gay marriage, but his role as the architect of the Iraq War saw him leave office  deeply unpopular  and cemented a polarizing legacy.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Williams, who worked as Pentagon press secretary during Cheney’s time as defense secretary, recalled offering to resign from his position after a magazine outed him as gay in 1991.\n \n\n   \n  “He wouldn’t hear of it, and for several days after that article appeared, he would call me on the direct line to my desk at the Pentagon to ask how I was doing and to tell me to get on with the job,” Williams said.\n \n\n   \n  While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was a lifetime hardline conservative who endorsed Trump’s 2016 campaign. But he spent the last years of his life speaking out against Trump, particularly after his daughter then-Rep. Liz Cheney drew the president’s ire for her prominent role in a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021,  insurrection at the Capitol .\n \n\n   \n  Liz Cheney made a reference to her father’s decision to support Harris over Trump last year. “For him,” she said, “a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.”\n \n\n   \n  The funeral’s guest list itself was also a nod to a time when Washington was not so polarized and politicians from both sides of the aisle paid their respects when a dignitary passed away.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Cheney  described Trump as a coward  and said no one was a “greater threat to our republic.”\n \n\n   \n  Pence, who similarly broke with Trump over the president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said that Cheney gave him two pieces of advice shortly after Pence was elected vice president in 2016. He urged Pence to spend “a lot of time on Capitol Hill” and to receive the president’s daily brief first thing in the morning, before attending any meeting with the president, in order to be better prepared for what would be discussed.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what’s coming and can run that through the filter of the president’s priorities,’” Pence told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny before the funeral.\n \n\n   \n  The White House offered a muted reaction after Cheney’s death with press secretary Karoline Leavitt telling reporters that Trump was “aware” the former vice president had died and noting that flags had been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Trump not being invited to the funeral, which  Axios  was first to report.\n \n\n   \n  Honorary pallbearers at Cheney’s funeral included members of his Secret Service detail; his former chiefs of staff, David Addington and Scooter Libby; and photographer David Hume Kennerly.\n \n\n   \n  On one of the last pages of the service leaflet was a quote from the writer and naturalist John Muir, saying: “The mountains are calling and I must go.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Jets, chips and a clean slate: Saudi Arabia’s crown prince got almost everything he wanted from Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant diplomatic shift, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman secured major concessions from President Donald Trump, including designation as a Major Non-NATO Ally, F-35 jet sales, and a new strategic defense agreement, while decoupling the requirement for full normalization with Israel.

clean slate: Saudi Arabia’s crown prince got almost everything he wanted from Trump \n       \n  Analysis by Abbas Al Lawati and Becky Anderson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Just three years ago, the US was openly  reconsidering its relationship  with Saudi Arabia. President Joe Biden had vowed to make Mohammed bin Salman a pariah. Even arms sales to one of America’s closest military partners were put under review.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the crown prince and de facto Saudi leader walked into the Oval Office to find a different world - one where President Donald Trump defended him so forcefully that he scolded a reporter for “ embarrassing our guest ” when she pressed him on the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the Oval Office theatrics, the substance of the administration’s announcements tells the real story of bin Salman’s remarkable rehabilitation in Washington. It also highlights Trump’s willingness to move past the Khashoggi episode and deepen relations with a kingdom that has pledged  nearly a trillion dollars  in US investments and maintains business ties with his own family.\n \n\n   \n  The visit also underscores the crown prince’s growing clout and his ability to skillfully navigate great power rivalries to his advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps his biggest win was persuading Trump to drop the one condition Washington had long insisted on before sealing major defense and trade deals with Riyadh: Full normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The shift marks another reversal from just a year ago, when the Biden administration insisted that any comprehensive US-Saudi deal could only move forward if  all three of its components  – bilateral defense and trade agreements, Saudi normalization with Israel, and an Israeli commitment to a pathway to a Palestinian state – advanced together. But with Israel rejecting the prospect of a Palestinian state and Saudi Arabia refusing to soften its position, the framework stalled.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Trump administration appears to have decoupled those components, handing Riyadh most of what it has long sought on defense, economics and regional security.\n \n\n   \n  This week it designated Saudi Arabia a Major Non-NATO Ally, moved forward with plans to  sell it F-35 jets  “pretty similar” to those flown by Israel, and signed a new Strategic Defense Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  In a nod to Riyadh’s singular focus to rewire its economy away from oil dependence, the two countries launched an  AI cooperation framework  which includes clearing of the sale of advanced chips to the kingdom, signed a critical minerals agreement, and opened the door to expand cooperation on nuclear energy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also delivered on bin Salman’s regional requests as the crown prince tries to reshape the Middle East’s security landscape, agreeing to help end the civil war in Sudan\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office, bin Salman framed the new agreements as delivering benefits for both the US and Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a very important time in our history,” bin Salman said in the Oval Office on Tuesday, seated beside Trump.\n \n\n   \n    What Saudi Arabia didn’t get\n \n\n   \n  While bin Salman received almost everything Saudi Arabia has been seeking from the US, there were two notable exceptions: a green light to domestically enrich uranium for future nuclear plants and a formal defense commitment.\n \n\n   \n  The US has long been reluctant to back a Saudi nuclear program that includes domestic uranium enrichment – a process that can produce bomb-grade material if purified to high levels – but CNN understands that Riyadh is reluctant to give up its right to do so, citing its substantial uranium deposits. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News on Wednesday that the agreement doesn’t include domestic enrichment.\n \n\n   \n  Among Washington’s Arab allies, Qatar has the strongest defense relationship with the US. It hosts the biggest US airbase in the region, was declared a Major Non-NATO ally in 2022, and this year received the strongest US security commitment for any Arab state, through an executive order declaring that any armed attack on the nation would be regarded as “a  threat to the peace and security  of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that Saudi Arabia is seeking at least as deep a security commitment from Washington. A senior Saudi source told CNN the kingdom wants a permanent agreement that would last beyond Trump’s presidency, a move that would ultimately require Congressional approval. But a White House statement made no mention of any obligation to defend the kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  “What (bin Salman) reportedly wants is a Senate-ratified defense commitment along the lines of a NATO Article 5 pledge,” wrote Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment think tank, referring to NATO’s mutual defense clause. “The last time Washington delivered that was 65 years ago, with the 1960 US-Japan treaty.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a case to be made for such a pact, he continued. “The United States went to war to protect Saudi and Gulf oil before, a defense pact might prove to be a deterrent to future predators, and it would lock Saudi Arabia into a pro-American alignment for years to come, boxing out our competitors Russia and especially China.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia has been signaling that it is willing to seek defense partners beyond the US should Washington not make a stronger commitment to its security. In late 2023, bin Salman was  explicit about the threat  in an interview with Fox News, saying the US doesn’t “want to see Saudi Arabia shifting their armament from America to another place.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Riyadh has been gradually  improving its ties with Beijing , culminating in the surprise rapprochement  between Saudi Arabia and Iran  in the Chinese capital in March 2023. The message has been that the US is Riyadh’s  first port of call , but there are others too.\n \n\n   \n  And earlier this year, bin Salman followed through on his quest to diversify security partners, securing protection from Riyadh’s closest Muslim ally, nuclear armed Pakistan. The mutual defense agreement marked a striking expansion of the kingdom’s search for non-US security guarantees.\n \n\n   \n  That hedging has not gone unnoticed in the halls of power in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s a positive move,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a top Republican foreign policy voice, said about the growing defense partnership between Riyadh and Washington. “Because to pull Saudi as an ally of the United States in this direction, rather than to China, and it will also solidify normalization in that process, in a post Gaza world.”\n \n\n   \n  The Eurasia Group think tank said in an analysis piece last week that the US-Saudi relationship is now driven more by great power competition than normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “The kingdom has become a key strategic partner in the US’s competition with China,” it said. “The strategic convergence underway between Washington and Riyadh will continue to be underpinned by the role the kingdom can play in supporting the US in sectors that are crucial for US competition with China.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that Riyadh’s calculation on normalization has shifted as Saudi public sentiment toward Israel has grown more negative and the kingdom has already secured many of the gains it expected from Washington.\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he got a “positive response” from bin Salman on normalizing with Israel but said he wouldn’t “use the word ‘commitment’.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alison Main, Manu Raju and Casey Riddle contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/tech/trump-eo-block-state-ai-regulations-safety-concerns","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump renews effort to block states from regulating AI, raising alarms about safety","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order to block state regulations on artificial intelligence, directing the U.S. attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge and preempt state-level AI laws.

\nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order that would block states from enforcing regulations around artificial intelligence, renewing an AI deregulation push that’s raising concerns among tech safety advocates and state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  The draft order directs the US attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws and preempt them with Trump’s more lax federal policy, according to a copy viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving technology is already subject to little oversight as it extends into more areas of life — from personal communications and relationships to health care and policing. In the absence of broad federal legislation, some states have passed laws to address potentially risky and harmful uses of AI, such as the creation of misleading deepfakes and algorithmic discrimination in hiring. Critics of the preemption push worry that if left unchecked, AI companies could evade accountability should their tools harm consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for comment about the pushback, a White House official told CNN that until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential orders is speculation.\n \n\n   \n  The language in Trump’s draft order mirrors the argument from some in the tech industry, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, that navigating a patchwork of state laws would slow down innovation and could affect America’s competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome, uniform national policy framework for AI,” the draft order states.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also suggested adding language blocking state AI regulations to the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual defense policy bill, in a Tuesday  post  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Congress killed an earlier attempt by Republicans to prevent states from regulating AI in July. The US Senate voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill before the bill passed. Weeks later, the Trump administration released a Silicon Valley-friendly  AI action plan , a package of initiatives and policy recommendations that largely centered on scaling back AI regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  While some in Silicon Valley may support easing up on AI regulation, the proposal has received broad pushback as concerns about AI safety have escalated in recent months. A growing  string of reports  have highlighted risks of the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Meta have also been scrambling to  block young people  from accessing adult content via AI systems.\n \n\n   \n  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the effort “federal government overreach” in a Tuesday  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Stripping states of jurisdiction to regulate AI is a subsidy to Big Tech and will prevent states from protecting against online censorship of political speech, predatory applications that target children, violations of intellectual property rights and data center intrusions on power/water resources,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Senator Ed Markey called out Republicans for “trying to sneak their AI regulation moratorium into the defense bill” and accused Trump of siding “with his billionaire Big Tech buddies,” in an X  post  Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The renewed preemption push comes as Trump hosted a dinner at the White House this week for business leaders, which was attended by many AI industry leaders, including Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and tech investor and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of organizations — including tech employee unions and other labor groups, tech safety and consumer protection nonprofits and educational institutions —  signed   letters to Congress  this week opposing the idea of blocking state AI regulations and raising alarms about AI safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft executive order isn’t about interstate commerce or American competitiveness,” Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, vice president of The Leadership Conference’s Center for Civil Rights and Technology, said in a statement. “It’s about giving the administration’s tech billionaire buddies and corporations a free pass rather than protecting the people it’s meant to serve.”\n \n\n   \n  J.B. Branch, big tech accountability advocate at the consumer protection nonprofit Public Citizen, noted in a statement that “AI scams are exploding, children have died by suicide linked to harmful online systems, and psychologists are warning about AI-induced breakdowns” and that blocking state regulations could “shield Silicon Valley from responsibility.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israel-west-bank-war-crimes-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Israel’s Forced Expulsion of Palestinians from West Bank Refugee Camps Amounts to War Crimes, HRW Alleges","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Human Rights Watch has alleged that Israel's mass expulsion of 32,000 Palestinians from three West Bank refugee camps — Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams — between January and February 2025 constitutes war crimes and crimes against humanity.

refugee camps amounts to war crimes, HRW alleges \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel’s forced removal of tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the  occupied West Bank  earlier this year amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged.\n \n\n   \n  According to a 105-page report released by the non-profit organization, 32,000 Palestinians were expelled by Israeli forces from three camps in January and February, while international attention was focused on  Israel’s war in Gaza , and they have not been allowed to return.\n \n\n   \n  As part of its research, HRW said it interviewed 31 displaced Palestinian refugees from Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery and Israeli military demolition orders, as well as verified video and images of Israeli military operations.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN in a statement that the military launched what it called Operation “Iron Wall” in the three camps ten months ago “in light of the security threats posed by these camps and the growing presence of terrorist elements within them.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it destroyed “rows of buildings” to create “new access routes inside the camps.” The military said the decision to demolish the buildings “was made based on operational necessity, with careful consideration and only after alternative options to achieve the same military advantage were examined.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said the “demolitions were conducted lawfully, based on military necessity and with the required proportionality” and that “terrorism in Judea and Samaria has decreased by 70%” since the start of the operation, using the biblical term for the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The HRW report claims that Israel stormed Jenin refugee camp on January 21, with Apache helicopters, drones, bulldozers, and armored vehicles carrying ground forces, to oust the Palestinians living there.\n \n\n   \n  Similar operations were carried out at Tulkaram on January 27, and Nur Shams on February 9.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli soldiers “were yelling and throwing things everywhere…. It was like a movie scene – some had masks and they were carrying all kinds of weapons,” one 54-year-old woman told HRW.\n \n\n   \n  The displaced Palestinians have not been permitted to return home, the report found, adding that Israeli soldiers fired upon those who did attempt to re-enter. Only a few have been allowed to collect their belongings, it said, while HRW analysis of satellite imagery six months on found that more than 850 homes and other buildings had been damaged or destroyed across the camps.\n \n\n   \n  No shelter or humanitarian assistance was offered to displaced residents by the Israeli military, the report found. Instead, people were left to fend for themselves, seeking shelter wherever they could, including crowding into the homes of relatives or friends, or arriving at mosques or local charities.\n \n\n   \n  All three camps date back to the early 1950s, when they were established by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to house Palestinians who were expelled from their homes or forced to flee following Israel’s creation in 1948. Those refugees and their descendants had resided there ever since.\n \n\n   \n  “Israeli authorities in early 2025 forcibly removed 32,000 Palestinians from their homes in West Bank refugee camps without regard to international legal protections and have not permitted them to return,” Nadia Hardman, a senior migrant rights researcher at HRW, said.\n \n\n   \n  “With global attention focused on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing in the West Bank that should be investigated and prosecuted.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has intensified operations across the West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing checkpoints, and cutting communities off from the outside world.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been an escalation in Israeli settler attacks and land grabs in the territory. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law.\n \n\n   \n  HRW is now calling for senior Israeli officials to be investigated over the expulsions, including Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, the Central Command commander who oversaw West Bank military operations.\n \n\n   \n  Where found responsible, they should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the organization said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/shutdown-holiday-travel-callout","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-05:00","title":"Changed your Thanksgiving plans?

Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00.000Z","title":"Invest in crypto?

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by  February 17, 2026  in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2026 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/business/walmart-economy-consumers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00.000Z","title":"Walmart just proved it’s America’s solution to the affordability crisis","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Walmart is emerging as a critical player in addressing the U.S. cost of living crisis, with a 4.5% increase in U.S. sales and growing market share, particularly from Target and discount retailers like Dollar General.

rose in September to the highest level in nearly four years.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, August’s tepid job gains of 22,000 were revised to a job loss of 4,000 jobs and July was revised down by 7,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The health care and social assistance sector continued to drive overall employment growth. Those sectors added an estimated 57,100 jobs in September, accounting for nearly half of the overall gains. Leisure and hospitality contributed 47,000 jobs during a month with unseasonably warm weather.\n \n\n   \n  Jobs were lost in sectors such as transportation and warehousing (-25,300), temporary help services (-15,900) and manufacturing (-6,000).\n \n\n   \n  Although the September employment data has been on the shelf since early October,  it provides a critical snapshot  of the labor market at a time when tariffs, stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates continue to slow the US economy.\n \n\n   \n    Summer of job losses\n \n\n   \n  Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November. The BLS on Wednesday announced that there will not be a separate October jobs report published but instead some of that data will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stronger-than-expected September gains, this year is still on pace for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “The job market was really weak in the summer, and it didn’t improve much in September,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Credit Union. “What we learned today is that both June and August had negative job growth, so, shedding jobs; 119,000 is pretty good for September, but when you step back, the average (monthly job gain) of the past four months is in the low 40,000s.”\n \n\n   \n  “So, it looks very weak,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Unemployment, a closely watched recession indicator, ticked higher in September, rising to the highest rate since October 2021.\n \n\n   \n  However, driving the jobless rate higher was an increase in the labor force – primarily an uplift in more people looking for work, versus a sharp increase in layoffs, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n    Low-fire, low-hire, low-opportunity market\n \n\n   \n  The job gains remain heavily concentrated. Two sectors – health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality – accounted for 87% of September’s job growth.\n \n\n   \n  But in a labor market that’s been in a low-hire, low-fire slog, there are also few opportunities for those seeking work. On average, it’s taking people six months to find work, according to the latest BLS data.\n \n\n   \n  The latest unemployment claims data supports that trend: In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that an estimated 1.974 million people filed continuing claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended November 8, hitting a fresh four-year high.\n \n\n   \n  Initial claims, which are considered the best proxy for layoff activity, fell to 220,000 last week, remaining well below more concerning thresholds (300,000 to 400,000 range, consistently).\n \n\n   \n  “If I had to characterize it, it still looks a lot like ‘no-hire, no-fire,’” Long said. “I do worry, given the number of industries that are starting to fire, that this is starting to look like ‘no-hire, start-to-fire.’”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Cold water’ for a Fed cut\n \n\n   \n  Despite the mixed bag of data, the September report “could throw cold water” on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates further when it meets in December, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, wrote in a note on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “The sharp rebound in employment gains, up 119,000 in September following the downwardly revised negative 4,000 print in August soothes concerns that the labor market was on the precipice of a large downturn and removes urgency for another rate cut,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Still, because of the historic government shutdown, the September jobs report will be the freshest official monthly employment snapshot available when the Fed makes its next interest rate decision on December 10. The partial October and full November data won’t come out until the following week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/football-nfl-week-12-five-things","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Shedeur starts, the Chiefs need a win and the Bengals can’t catch a break: 5 things to know about NFL Week 12","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 12 of the 2025 NFL season features a mix of critical injuries, defensive struggles, and high-stakes matchups.

Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Week 12 of the  NFL  season brings about a big game for Patrick Mahomes and Co., injury intrigue and a sneakily important  Monday Night Football  game.\n \n\n   \n  From Shedeur Sanders starting for the Cleveland Browns to the Cincinnati Bengals never seeming to catch a break, here are five things to know about Week 12.\n \n\n   \n    Rodgers’ wrist clouds Steelers’ week\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers fans can breathe – at least a little. Head coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that Aaron Rodgers will not need surgery on the fracture in his left, non-throwing wrist. Whether he actually plays Sunday in Chicago? Still a coin flip.\n \n\n   \n  The 41-year-old’s practice status on Friday will likely decide everything. Rodgers said his ability to protect himself is going to be the deciding factor, not pain management.\n \n\n   \n  And make no mistake: Rodgers would love nothing more than another crack at the Bears. During his Packers days, he saw them twice a year and went 24-5 against Chicago, famously telling fans – multiple times – that he “owns” the Bears.\n \n\n   \n  If Rodgers can’t go, Mason Rudolph is expected to step in.\n \n\n   \n    Bengals defense reaches historic lows\n \n\n   \n   Joe Burrow  could return on Thanksgiving night against the Baltimore Ravens – but the Bengals may already be out of runway.\n \n\n   \n  At 3-7, Cincinnati can’t afford another slip if it wants any shot at the postseason. The defense, in particular, has put them in a historic hole. The Bengals have allowed 27 or more points in each of the last nine games, becoming the first team in NFL history to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Now, they get a New England Patriots team that’s quietly rolling. Rookie quarterback Drake Maye leads the NFL with 2,836 passing yards, and here’s the wild part: He hasn’t had a single 300-yard game. No explosions – just relentless, efficient production every week.\n \n\n   \n  The Patriots are 9-2 and suddenly staring at a possible No. 1 seed if they keep stacking wins.\n \n\n   \n    Chiefs-Colts: A season-defining test\n \n\n   \n  The AFC’s game of the week features the 5-5 Chiefs hosting the 8-2 Indianapolis Colts, and nothing about Kansas City’s season has gone the way anyone expected.\n \n\n   \n  A year after going 11-0 in one-score games, the Chiefs are 0-5 in those same situations this season. The late-game Mahomes magic just hasn’t shown up. The three-time Super Bowl winner has bluntly put the blame on himself: “We haven’t been consistent enough to win games. It starts with me.”\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming the Chiefs’ starter, Mahomes has never failed to reach at least the AFC Championship Game. A loss on Sunday would drop Kansas City to 5-6, and the margin for error the rest of the way becomes razor-thin.\n \n\n   \n    Another week, another Browns QB\n \n\n   \n  The more things change, the more they stay the same: A new QB is going to be under center in Cleveland. The Browns are turning to rookie Shedeur Sanders on Sunday in Las Vegas, making him the 42nd starting quarterback the franchise has used since returning in 1999 – a staggering reminder of the instability that has defined the position in Cleveland for over 25 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sanders was thrown into the fire last week against the Ravens after Dillon Gabriel exited with a concussion, and the results were rough. The rookie finished just 4-of-16 for 47 yards and an interception, struggling to find any rhythm against a tough Baltimor defense.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he gets his first full start – and his first real opportunity to rewrite the narrative.\n \n\n   \n  For Sanders, it’s a chance to show the Raiders, and every team that passed on him in the draft (which is all other 31 franchises considering he was selected with the 155th pick in the 4th round), that they misjudged him. For the Browns, it’s yet another hope that maybe this time they’ve found a spark.\n \n\n   \n    Niners-Panthers take the MNF stage\n \n\n   \n  Monday Night Football brings a sneaky-important NFC matchup: the 7-4 San Francisco 49ers hosting the 6-5 Carolina Panthers.\n \n\n   \n  Brock Purdy returned from his toe injury last week and hardly missed a beat, throwing 19-of-26 for 200 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-22 win over Arizona. With the NFC wild card picture tightening, this one carries real postseason weight.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco’s path is tougher – the NFC West has been the best division in football with the Los Angeles Rams (8-2), Seattle Seahawks (7-3), and Niners (7-4) all above water.\n \n\n   \n  The Panthers are coming off a huge overtime win in Atlanta that saw Bryce Young throw for a career-high 448 yards. He could be in for another big game as the Niners’ banged up secondary gives up the  fifth-most passing yards per game  in the league.\n \n\n   \n  And here’s your weird stat of the week: the Panthers are 6-0 when winning the coin toss and 0-5 when losing it. So, we may know how this one goes before the ball ever leaves the tee.\n \n\n   \n    Full NFL Week 12 schedule\n \n\n   \n   Away @ home \n \n\n   \n   Thursday \n \n\n   \n  Buffalo Bills @ Houston Texans, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Sunday \n \n\n   \n  Indianapolis Colts @ Kansas City Chiefs, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Seattle Seahawks @ Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Jets @ Baltimore Ravens, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Giants @ Detroit Lions, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers @ Chicago Bears, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Cleveland Browns @ Las Vegas Raiders, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville Jaguras @ Arizona Cardinals, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Philadelphia Eagles @ Dallas Cowboys, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Los Angeles Rams, 8:20 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Monday \n \n\n   \n  Carolina Panthers @ San Francisco 49ers, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/transgender-ideology-gender-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-05:00","title":"The White House wants to eliminate ‘gender ideology’ and ‘trans ideology.’ What does that mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the political and societal rise of the terms 'gender ideology' and 'transgender ideology' in U.S. policy and public discourse, particularly under the Trump administration.

It was the newest escalation in a running conflict that began when a student in a summer course on children’s literature recorded video of herself accusing her professor of going “against our president’s laws” by teaching “gender ideology” and declared that she was reporting the purported violation to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Republican politicians seized on the video as a scandal, with one state representative calling it “TRANSGENDER INDOCTRINATION.” The Trump administration joined in, with Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon calling it  “deeply concerning”  and declaring she would look into it. Within days, the professor had been  fired , students led academic freedom  protests , and the president of the system’s flagship university  resigned  for reasons unspecified — all in the wake of a controversy about whether a class about children’s literature could legally discuss a children’s book about a 12-year-old coming out as nonbinary.\n \n\n   \n  In the past year, the terms “gender ideology” and its sibling, “transgender ideology,” have become ubiquitous — in government documents and policy announcements, in mass media and in online disputes. The White House has declared its intention to stamp them out. Yet what do they mean, exactly?\n \n\n   \n    Donald Trump demands ‘biological truth’\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, North Carolina passed the law HB2, colloquially known as the “Bathroom Bill,” banning people from using public restrooms that did not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The backlash was immediate: advocates nationwide sprang into action against it, the general public was appalled, the state lost  millions of dollars  in business and the NCAA pulled its high-profile sporting events. One year later, the bill was repealed.\n \n\n   \n  Yet less than a decade later, restrictions on transgender people have taken hold of state and national policy. While HB2 was viewed by some as a blatant form of transgender discrimination, similar mandates are being imposed and upheld by every level of government today.\n \n\n   \n  On President Donald Trump’s first day in office this year, he signed an executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” In it, he ordered the federal government to replace the term “gender” with “sex” throughout its policies and documents and declared that “sex” referred to “an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.”\n \n\n   \n  “Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex,” the  executive order read . “Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”\n \n\n   \n  Zaya Perysian, however, said Trump’s order brought a new and dangerous inconsistency to her life. Under the new White House rules, Perysian, a content creator who has documented her transition online, was issued a passport that identifies her as male, the sex she was assigned at birth. This left Perysian — with her chest-length curls and low-cut clothes, after more than five years on estrogen and both top and bottom surgery — holding a government ID that didn’t match her other legal documents. All the passport does, she said, is put her at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re 1% of the population and 90% of the conversation,” Perysian said. “It’s just so ridiculous. We’re always being forced to defend ourselves against complete nonsense and complete propaganda.”\n \n\n   \n    Finding ideology everywhere\n \n\n   \n  The term “gender ideology” didn’t originate in the US. The phrase has been part of a larger  anti-gender movement  taking shape across the world — first in Europe in the 2010s and now in Latin America, Africa and the US — particularly among conservative governments, religious groups and civil society groups, according to  a United Nations report . In 2018, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro centered  his right-wing election campaign against  “gender ideology.” Brazil is one of the  deadliest countries  for transgender people.\n \n\n   \n  The worldwide movement against “gender ideology” views the use of the term “gender” in classifying people’s social identities as a way to “destroy the traditional family and family values,” the UN report states. Indeed, much of the opposition is framed as a religious, moral choice: When Bolsonaro visited the White House  in 2019 , he decried “gender ideology” by saying both countries share a “respect to traditional and family lifestyles, respect to God, our creator, against the gender ideology of the politically correct attitudes and fake news.”\n \n\n   \n  “Transgender ideology,” a phrase largely used in the US, is, if anything, even more amorphous. Trump, in various public remarks or executive orders, has vowed to “get  transgender ideology  the hell out of our military,” to stop child abuse by “prohibiting public schools from indoctrinating our children with  transgender ideology ,” and to undo what he called the Biden administration’s efforts to “force Christians to affirm radical  transgender ideology .” During the investigation of the killing of Charlie Kirk, law enforcement leaked a preliminary internal report to the media incorrectly claiming the shooter’s ammunition had been marked with “ transgender ideology .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his followers now use “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology” more or less interchangeably. A scroll through social media shows both phrases cropping up in conservative and right-wing corners of the internet, largely as a shorthand for anything pertaining to transgender people. Using a transgender person’s  correct pronouns ? That’s transgender ideology. A Glamour magazine cover  celebrating transgender women ? Also transgender ideology.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes, the content of the “ideology” isn’t even stated. Florida’s commissioner of education removed a sociology professor from a curriculum workgroup for “promoting gender ideology,” he announced on X, without ever specifying how  that ideology had actually been promoted . His replies were filled with hundreds of thank yous anyway.\n \n\n   \n    What makes trans people a unique target\n \n\n   \n  Jay W. Richards is a director at The Heritage Foundation and a contributor to the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025, who wrote about “gender ideology” back in 2023. That people can be divided into two sexes, male or female, is a matter of “biological reality,” he said — though biological research on sex distinctions has yielded  more complicated results . Richards described “gender ideology” as “toxic,” saying it causes people to misunderstand who they are. Having a subjective, internal sense of gender, he told CNN, should not constitute one’s literal identity. Those who are questioning their gender need help “to understand their bodily reality.”\n \n\n   \n  The goal, he said, is to successfully “defeat gender ideology.”\n \n\n   \n  “Say, 25 years from now, it never occurred to a child that he or she might be born in the wrong body, that to be whole, he or she needs to take body and mind-altering drugs and undergo radical surgery in order to be whole,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  That goal goes against the advice of major medical organizations. The American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support what they call  gender-affirming care  — a multidisciplinary approach that includes medically necessary and scientific evidence-based practices that has been shown to be  life-saving for transgender people. \n \n\n   \n  Yet more than half of US states have banned  some care for transgender youth  including puberty blockers, other hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgery (although research shows such surgeries are  rarely performed on minors  in the US).\n \n\n   \n  By using “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology,” people are explicitly trying to diminish the human nature of gender identity, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician and former director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  “They want it to be like, this person isn’t a transgender person, they’re an ideologue,” he said. “These are not evidence and science-based things that they’re saying. They’re really trying to destabilize the base of science that brought us to the place where gender diversity was something that we were supporting for people’s health.”\n \n\n   \n  In most other areas of medical care, it’s a generally accepted premise that people and their doctors make decisions together. When it comes to questions like avoiding vaccination, the Trump administration encourages people to follow their subjective beliefs, even amid rampant disinformation and, in some cases, limited access. Yet the government’s program of fighting “trans ideology” means that trans people are excluded from those principles — along with everyday principles like “ call people what they want to be called ” and “don’t  fire people from their jobs  because of their personal identity.”\n \n\n   \n  The usage casts transgender and nonbinary people as having succumbed to an undefined doctrine, rather than experiencing a differing gender identity. Trans personhood isn’t an identity, these terms suggest, it’s a belief imposed on people by outside ideological forces. And those forces, those so-called ideologies, can be overturned.\n \n\n   \n  “When you make our existence into an ideology, it becomes much easier to dismiss us than it is if you approach us as people,” said Laurel Powell, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Ban gender, spread measles\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the language is “demonizing transgender people as a group,” said Chase Strangio, attorney and co-director of the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project. Using this rhetoric suggests that people’s identities are an ideological threat to a country’s national order.\n \n\n   \n  “Part of what’s happening here is, ‘Oh, the world is changing in scary ways. It’s a threat to the order,’” Strangio said. “‘Gender ideology is at the root. We’re going to root it out.’”\n \n\n   \n  The effects of this rooting out are already seen. Already, between May 2024 and May 2025, hate attacks against transgender people increased by 14% compared with the year before, according  to GLAAD data . More than half of all anti-LGBTQ incidents tracked over the year targeted transgender and gender diverse people specifically. Political rhetoric can have potentially deadly effects.  One study found  that when states pass anti-trans laws, like bans on trans-specific health care or sports participation, there’s a rise in transgender and nonbinary teens’ suicide attempts.\n \n\n   \n  The downstream effects of politicizing gender identity aren’t only harmful to transgender people.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most notable uses of this terminology was earlier this year, when an array of government health webpages were taken down in order to scrub  references to “gender ideology.”  To comply with the executive order, Daskalakis said the CDC had to pull down a 45-minute video educating providers about measles care — in the midst of a  measles outbreak in Texas  — because they uttered the phrase “gender identity” once.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a prime example of what happens when ideology is powered up beyond science and concern for the health of people,” Daskalakis said.\n \n\n   \n  When identity becomes politicized, vulnerable populations start to falter and the entire country is weakened. In the long term, Daskalakis said vulnerable populations “will experience worse health, will get sick, and some will die.”\n \n\n   \n  “The stakes are high,” he said. “There will be people who are going to further demonize and vilify people based on who they are. And we know how that goes in the US.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/africa/nnamdi-kanu-terrorism-conviction-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-05:00","title":"Nigerian court convicts separatist leader Kanu for terrorism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigerian court convicts separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu on seven terrorism-related charges, citing that his broadcasts and orders to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) incited deadly attacks.

CNN\n \n   \n  Oscar-winning actor  Kevin Spacey  has said he’s got “no home,” citing the costs he’s incurred following allegations of sexual assault.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to UK newspaper  The Daily Telegraph  in an interview published Wednesday, Spacey revealed that the financial fallout of the allegations, which came to light in 2017, resulted in him losing his house.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, a New York jury found Spacey not liable for battery over allegations he picked up actor Anthony Rapp and laid on top of him after a party in 1986. And in 2023, Spacey was cleared of a number of sexual assault charges by a court in London, United Kingdom, in a separate case.\n \n\n   \n  “The costs over these last seven years have been astronomical. I’ve had very little coming in and everything going out,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is in storage, and I hope at some point, if things continue to improve, that I’ll be able to decide where I want to settle down again,” added Spacey.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m living in hotels, I’m living in Airbnbs, I’m going where the work is. I literally have no home, that’s what I’m attempting to explain,” he said, adding that his financial situation was “not great.”\n \n\n   \n  Spacey, 66, built a hugely successful career after starting out as a stage actor in the 1980s. He went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for “The Usual Suspects” (1995) and the Academy Award for Best Actor for “American Beauty” (1999).\n \n\n   \n  He was artistic director at London’s Old Vic theater between 2004 and 2015, and played Frank Underwood in Netflix political drama “House of Cards.”\n \n\n   \n  However, in 2017, actor Rapp said  Spacey had made a sexual advance  toward him in 1986, when Rapp was then 14 and Spacey was 26.\n \n\n   \n  As other allegations of abuse followed, Netflix cut ties with Spacey on the series “House of Cards” and his scenes in the Ridley Scott movie “ All the Money in the World ” were re-shot by the late Christopher Plummer.\n \n\n   \n  Spacey denied any allegations of improper or criminal behavior and a New York jury found him not liable for battery against Rapp in October 2022.\n \n\n   \n  He was also found not guilty of seven counts of sexual assault and two counts of other serious sexual offenses at a court in London in July 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Despite these legal victories, Spacey is yet to be welcomed back into the Hollywood fold.\n \n\n   \n  “We are in touch with some extremely powerful people who want to put me back to work,” he told The Daily Telegraph, which has previously  published statements of support  for Spacey from Hollywood peers such as Sharon Stone and Liam Neeson.\n \n\n   \n  “And that will happen in its right time. But I will also say what I think the industry seems to be waiting for is to be given permission – by someone who is in some position of enormous respect and authority.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-reversal-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-04:00","title":"How Trump Reversed Course on the Epstein Files as His Administration Faces Lingering Suspicion About Their Release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed his earlier stance on suppressing the Jeffrey Epstein files, signing a bill to compel the release of the documents after months of internal resistance and public pressure.

Evan Perez, Kristen Holmes, Kaitlan Collins, Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Wednesday sought to bring a swift end to perhaps the most damaging saga of his term,  signing a measure  compelling the release of the Epstein files after losing a monthslong, tooth-and-nail fight to prevent their disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  The decision represents a stunning reversal for the president aimed chiefly at quelling a brewing GOP revolt and restoring his iron grip over the party. But few believe the path will be so easy from here.\n \n\n   \n  “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,” Trump posted on Truth Social late in the day, framing the overwhelming votes for it in Congress as a result of his involvement.\n \n\n   \n  The measure becoming law is now set to open a fraught new stage in  the push for the files  tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, putting the Justice Department under fresh scrutiny and testing the White House’s ability to pivot attention away from the president’s past dealings with Epstein and toward more advantageous political ground.\n \n\n   \n  At an unrelated press conference earlier Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi would only say that the Justice Department would “follow the law” when asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  But already, officials face growing suspicion from Capitol Hill and their MAGA base that the administration will use a just-opened, Trump-ordered criminal investigation as an excuse to keep some of the Epstein case file under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  Justice officials, meanwhile, are scrambling to balance their probe with a looming December deadline for releasing the documents after being caught off-guard by both Trump’s demand for a new investigation and his subsequent sudden support Sunday evening for making all the Epstein files public, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  And even as the White House tries to accelerate past the controversy to focus on next year’s midterm elections, there remains little sign that Trump’s supporters are anywhere near ready to leave it behind.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a storyline that’s going to continue to dog the president into the second year of his presidency,” said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP operative. “The Epstein conspiracies have reached moon landing status. And we’ll never stop talking about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The relentless intrigue surrounding the Epstein files marks the rare issue that has driven a wedge between Trump and the Republican Party he’s led for the last decade, exposing a vulnerability for the White House made all the more frustrating by the fact that it’s largely the result of a series of self-inflicted wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Since it became clear that he could not suppress the files’ release, Trump has tried to reunify the GOP behind a new effort to tie Epstein directly to the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  In announcing he’d signed the bill, Trump focused squarely on Democrats, writing, “Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed,” and adding, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”\n \n\n   \n  The offensive has drawn on newly disclosed Epstein emails that mention various prominent Democrats, alongside numerous references to Trump — a development that White House officials hope will put them back on offense after months under siege. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  “All of a sudden there existed a real opportunity to change the narrative,” one official told CNN, noting that aides had only limited knowledge of what was in the documents compiled by Epstein’s estate until a House committee released them last week.   \n \n\n   \n  But the strategic shift comes after months of failed gambits, dismissals and outright resistance to releasing the files — all of which has sapped precious attention and time from the administration’s core agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The president now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of his term so far, as well as the twin challenges of waging an uphill battle toward the midterms while keeping a lid on the simmering divisions over Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president was in the right position at the end,” GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said of his support for the Epstein measure. “The rest of the story now is that they will have to deliver on that package in very short order, and then it’s going to depend upon what’s in the package and what’s been withheld.”\n \n\n   \n    Pressure for the files was a problem of Trump’s own making\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s signature on the bill — and the credit he claimed for its success — capped a public push for the files that the president himself first fueled nearly a year-and-a-half ago, after he pledged on the campaign trail to release the materials if elected.\n \n\n   \n  His team then leaned into that off-hand commitment   as a way to energize a segment of the GOP base that’s been fixated on the Epstein files and has been convinced they would implicate a range of powerful figures in the late financier’s sexual abuse of young girls.\n \n\n   \n  The administration further heightened expectations in February, when Bondi distributed “Epstein Files” binders to conservative influencers at the White House. The event was a dud; virtually all of the information was already public, sparking public backlash and opening the door to months of private tensions among top DOJ officials.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later claimed the administration was poring over newer materials, only for the DOJ to announce months later that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”\n \n\n   \n  The ensuing firestorm pitted the White House against many of the MAGA figures who had aided Trump’s rise, sparked a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to force the release of the files and prompted an internal scramble to tamp down an issue that threatened to consume the administration through much of the summer.\n \n\n   \n  That effort became more challenging in the wake of revelations that magnified Trump’s past connections to Epstein, including that the president’s name had surfaced in the files. (Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, aides sought to manage the expectations of their allies, trying to explain that publicizing the rest of the files risked harming victims and violating the privacy of people whose names were in the documents but not credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly took to social media to try to browbeat Republicans in line, insisting that the files he once vowed to release were now little more than a Democratic “hoax.” Yet neither approach succeeding in quelling the calls for more disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to explain to people that they’re believing in something that does not exist,” a senior White House official said. “That’s why it’s so frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n    New investigation raises fresh questions about what will be released\n \n\n   \n  At one point, as the congressional effort to compel the Epstein files’ release gained steam, officials floated launching the new DOJ investigation as a way to alleviate the pressure and block any more documents from being released, an administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear whether the option made it to Trump. A White House official said the idea of an investigation into Democrats came after the emails were released by the House oversight panel last week. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday’s unrelated press conference, Bondi said that “new information” obtained by investigators had prompted her to reopen the Epstein matter without specifying what that was.\n \n\n   \n  So last Friday, as the House vote on releasing the files loomed, Trump abruptly called for the DOJ to probe Epstein’s connections to a handful of Democrat-aligned figures including former President Bill Clinton. He also sought an inquiry into the banking giant JPMorgan Chase’s associations with Epstein.   (Responding to the probe, spokespeople for Clinton and JPMorgan maintained they were not involved in Epstein’s crimes.)\n \n\n   \n  The White House insists Trump has always been on the side of releasing the files. “President Trump has never been against releasing the Epstein files — rather, he has always been against Republicans falling into the Democrat trap of talking about this rather than focusing on the historic tax cuts signed into law, the fact that zero illegal aliens have entered our country in five months, and the many other accomplishments of the Trump Administration on behalf of the American people,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  And since the opening of the new investigation, multiple White House officials have insisted to CNN that Trump will not stand in the way of the documents being released and that aides have little reason to believe the new investigation will affect that process, though Bondi declined to offer any explicit assurances on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Within the DOJ, some officials have lamented that Trump’s novel support for releasing the files amounts to a lose-lose — with Bondi and her department now facing dueling directives to both run an investigation and make public its pertinent documents.\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s belated bid now to lean into the Epstein files as a political attack line has also generated some grumbling among allies on Capitol Hill and in the broader Trump orbit who had hoped to move on from a challenging period.\n \n\n   \n  In the last two weeks, some of these allies noted, Trump oversaw an end to the record-long government shutdown, promoted the administration’s efforts on key affordability issues and hosted a series of high-profile diplomatic events.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as Trump and his aides try to turn the tables on Democrats over Epstein, “this is all anyone’s talking about,” Conant said.\n \n\n   \n  “The power of the presidency is the ability to set the agenda,” he added. “And to the extent that this is a distraction, it does undermine what else he can do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/golden-state-killer-case-update-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00+00:00","title":"A prosecutor reveals new details about the capture of one of America’s most notorious serial killers","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the capture and prosecution of Joseph DeAngelo, known as the Golden State Killer, one of America’s most notorious serial killers.

details about the capture of one of America’s most notorious serial killers \n       \n  By Faith Karimi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:04 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Joseph DeAngelo   moved through California neighborhoods like a shadow.\n \n\n   \n  He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.\n \n\n   \n  What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the  Golden State Killer .\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s. In April 2018, nearly four decades after his last known crimes, police armed with DNA evidence surrounded his house in the quiet Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights and arrested him.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in a T-shirt, cargo shorts and tube socks, a shocked DeAngelo offered no resistance when detectives moved in after he stepped into his yard. In a jarring contrast to the cruelty he once inflicted, the predator who’d terrorized residents in 11 counties did not fight back. But he protested in a high-pitched voice, ‘I have a roast in the oven!’”\n \n\n   \n  Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.\n \n\n   \n  “He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “ The People vs. the Golden State Killer. ” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo was convicted of multiple murders in August 2020 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n \n\n   \n    Why do you think DeAngelo shut down in the hours after his arrest?\n \n\n   \n  He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t realize that his mental defense didn’t work, because this isn’t the first time he tried it. In 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer, he was caught by store security, and he was acting like he was crazy, mumbling to himself, saying crazy things. And when the police came, he admitted he was pretending to be crazy, hoping that security wouldn’t call them. He has used this technique of pretending to be crazy, so we knew it was fake.\n \n\n   \n    At the beginning of his crime spree, he was a police officer, even working on task forces hunting him. Did that help him evade capture?\n \n\n   \n  It did. The first series of crimes, he was the Visalia Ransacker from 1974 to 1975. There were 120 burglaries in a three-mile square radius. It turned out he was a police officer in a nearby town, and he was on the task force to find the Visalia Ransacker, and he was the ransacker. He left Visalia in central California and moved up to Sacramento, where he started committing rapes there. As a police officer, he knew how everything operated, how long it took to respond to the scene, where they would set up their blockades and how to get around that. He used his expert knowledge as a police officer to commit his crimes, find his victims and then escape.\n \n\n   \n    What drove his escalation from voyeurism and burglary to rape and murder?\n \n\n   \n  It was that insatiable appetite for power.\n \n\n   \n  When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.\n \n\n   \n  And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.\n \n\n   \n  And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.\n \n\n   \n    Some of the survivors made their voices heard in court. How did you track them down decades later and prepare them to testify?\n \n\n   \n  After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.\n \n\n   \n  We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.\n \n\n   \n    Your book focuses more on the survivors and law enforcement officials than on the killer himself. What was the reasoning behind that approach?\n \n\n   \n  A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.\n \n\n   \n  During the impact statement, she says, ‘I’ve brought somebody here with me today that was also a victim, and her name is Bonnie.’ And Bonnie comes up. And Bonnie was actually engaged to DeAngelo about 40 years ago but had broken up with him.\n \n\n   \n  And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.\n \n\n   \n  Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’\n \n\n   \n  It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n    His crimes were horrifying. Is there a particular survivor whose story has stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  When I think about the case now, I don’t think about him or the crimes. I think about the survivors. One of them, Phyllis Hennemann, was the very first rape victim in Sacramento. She was diagnosed with cancer, and when it was time for court she couldn’t be there because she was having chemo. But when DeAngelo was sentenced, I looked across the courtroom, and there’s Phyllis sitting there. And she had this twinkle on her eye. For the first time in 40 years, she got justice. About three months later, she died from cancer. I think about her a lot … that we were able to get her that justice.\n \n\n   \n    After four decades, was there a moment in the investigation that marked a turning point?\n \n\n   \n  DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.\n \n\n   \n  And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.\n \n\n   \n    Having seen the evidence up close, which details have stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.\n \n\n   \n    Do you believe there are more victims out there?\n \n\n   \n  I do. His last known crime was the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz in Orange County. People ask me, ‘Why did he stop in 1986’? And my answer is, ‘How do you know he stopped in 1986?’\n \n\n   \n  There’s a three-year period from 1986 to 1989, when he was living in LA, that we’re not sure exactly where he was and what he was doing. And he was already beginning to evolve as a killer. So what’s to say he didn’t continue to kill his victims, but he discarded the bodies somewhere that we never found?\n \n\n   \n    You describe justice in this case as not just a legal victory but a personal, full-circle moment for you. Why?\n \n\n   \n  I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.\n \n\n   \n    What’s DeAngelo’s life like in prison today?\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.\n \n\n   \n  So he’s in his own version of hell, where he belongs.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/charlotte-ice-raids-residents-mobilizing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Volunteer patrols and the PTA at school entrances: How some Charlotte residents are mobilizing amid the immigration crackdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a sweeping federal immigration crackdown in Charlotte, North Carolina — dubbed 'Operation Charlotte’s Web' — residents have mobilized through volunteer patrols, school-based safety measures, and community guard efforts.

Joel Simpson, a pastor at First United Methodist Church in Taylorsville, said before a dissonant symphony of whistles filled the church.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to report active operations that are happening in our city, alert people nearby and offer reminders of our rights,” Simpson, who led the training, told the crowd. “We’re going to document and record unlawful practices, and we’re going to deter violence by getting as many people as possible to join quickly as an organized presence.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan is simple: Volunteers sign up for shifts and receive instructions from a “patrol dispatch team” on specific zones in Charlotte they will drive around in and alert people when they see immigration enforcement activity. They’re advised to do it in pairs, keep a safe distance from agents and to never try to physically impede law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative is just one of many launched by Charlotte residents to help immigrant neighbors as the Trump administration touts  over 250 arrests  in the area since the aggressive immigration crackdown began over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Parents are banding together to guard school entrances or carpool students to class, and business owners across the city are patrolling their neighborhoods and closing their doors to protect their customers.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  have been  using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico were seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the fear throughout the city is palpable: families are keeping their children home from school and taking off from work, worrying they’ll be targeted by federal immigration agents.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Loving your neighbors is holy’\n \n\n   \n  Immigrant worker group Siembra NC organized Wednesday’s event at the church to train volunteers to help immigrants safely get to school and work and guard against constitutional violations during immigration enforcement activities, according to the organization.\n \n\n   \n  Volunteers stood outside the church doors, passing out warning whistles and held signs saying “Loving your neighbors is holy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of volunteers have attended training sessions held by the group to help immigrants as they travel within the city, document and record “unlawful practices” by agents and warn about enforcement activity, Simpson said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re coming out on weeknights and they’re saying this is how we need to be spending our time and we want to be on the streets and in our communities, making sure people are cared for,” Simpson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Over 1,000 people registered for Wednesday’s training and some people had to be turned away, the pastor said.\n \n\n   \n  Simpson said they got “best practices” from other communities that have been stops in the administration’s immigration blitz, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “People are telling me as they go through this training like, ‘I’m feeling empowered,’” he said. “‘I feel like I can do something and there’s a way to channel my love and my anger and my fear into something that supports other people.’”\n \n\n   \n  That was the case for Maria Klein, who has used the training as a way to channel her frustration about the crackdown in her city.\n \n\n   \n  She attended the training because she cares about “our children who should be able to go to school safely, for our parents who should be able to go to work for the American dream.” Klein, who teaches English as a Second Language to adults, says many of her students have stopped attending class.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an opportunity to really do something practical and to have an immediate impact,” Klein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Parents and teachers help families as school attendance plummets\n \n\n   \n  “What is gonna happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?”\n \n\n   \n  “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  These are the questions teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN she has been getting from students at Charlotte East Language Academy since the immigration crackdown began in the city.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell them that I’m gonna fight if someone comes to my door. I’m fighting – hands, feet, it doesn’t matter. You’re not coming in my classroom and taking any of my kids,” Roldan said. “My classroom is a safe space and it will stay that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Amid “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – the immigration enforcement operation in the city named after the classic 1952 children’s book – more than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders   hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools teacher David Gillespie says hallways and classrooms were nearly empty on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate  WCNC . “Whether because their parents were involved in detainments or because their parents have to make that unfortunate safety calculus — is it worth it to send my kids to school and put myself at risk?”\n \n\n   \n  As attendance plummets, some parents in the district are organizing to help families who are afraid to leave their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Some PTA members are standing guard at school entrances during drop-off and pick-up so they can alert staff and families if they see federal immigration agents, WCNC reported. Others are passing out information packets and using PTA funds to help families experiencing food insecurity or transportation issues.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re standing there bearing witness and being part of the community,” PTA member Amy Hawnelson told WCNC. “They do not stick around — and that’s why we’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  Another member, Mike Mastry, said they want to help students feel safe at school.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing a familiar face that’s friendly and smiling helps bring a sense of normalcy,” Mastry told WCNC. “When kids don’t know what’s going on, they get disoriented and have trouble learning.”\n \n\n   \n  Roldan said parents with legal status are picking up children whose parents may not have legal status to bring them to school.\n \n\n   \n  Gillespie says he’s reaching out to families to help students stay on top of schoolwork.\n \n\n   \n  Extracurriculars have been impacted by the operation too. OurBRIDGE, an organization that helps newly arrived immigrant children and their families, has suspended its afterschool programs after Border Patrol activity at one of its sites, the group  announced  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, photos of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n  “The students’ main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the demonstration said.\n \n\n   \n    Business owners work to protect customers\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte business owner Bryan Li enrolled in a training session offered by a local advocacy group and has been out patrolling the city the past few days, looking for federal agents and reporting back to advocacy groups that alert the community.\n \n\n   \n  Li, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, told CNN he couldn’t sit at home and not do something.\n \n\n   \n  “When harm is done, more people rally, learn and prepare so we can help protect our most vulnerable,” Li told CNN. “Charlotte will stand united and protect our immigrant community with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  While people like Li patrol the city, many businesses have shuttered their doors, fearing their customers will be a target.\n \n\n   \n  About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. Community members showed up afterwards to guard the business.\n \n\n   \n  Beth Clements, who stood outside the bakery wearing a yellow vest, had been standing guard there for three days.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to walk the streets with my whistle and I want to keep my neighbors protected because they deserve protection and they deserve to live in a world where they’re not scared,” Clements said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98589","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-05:00","title":"What former ally did Trump call a 'ranting lunatic' this week?

Crow responds to Trump's sedition threat \n         By Leila Fadel, Destinee Adams \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 6:48 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Six Democratic lawmakers, all of whom served in the military or intelligence community, uploaded a  short online video  this week, reminding still-serving U.S. service members that they can and must refuse illegal orders that violate the Constitution. President  Trump responded to the video  in a series of Truth Social posts on Thursday morning, accusing the Congress members of sedition. \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" Trump wrote. The president went on to share and repost a series of comments from other Truth Social users, including posts that said the Democrats should be hanged, their actions were an insurrection and they should all be indicted because of the video. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline  Leavitt denied the president wanted to execute members of Congress , adding \"The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command, and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed. It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging.\" Rep. Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who participated in the video, told  Morning Edition  host Leila Fadel that he's been receiving death threats since Trump's social media posts.

He's one of the Democratic lawmakers that was in that video message to U.S. service members. He's also a former paratrooper and Army Ranger. Congressman, good morning and thank you for joining me. JASON CROW: Good morning. FADEL: So what was it like to see the president call you and your colleagues traitors who should face execution? CROW: Well, it wasn't a great day. I can tell you that. It's not the first time I've received death threats doing this job, unfortunately, and I'm sure it won't be the last. But I'm not going to be intimidated. I'm not going to allow... FADEL: Do you consider what he said, the president, a death threat? CROW: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's no other way to take it. FADEL: I understand you've also gotten other death threats since these comments. CROW: Yeah. FADEL: Walk me through what you've been dealing with. CROW: Well, that's right. I mean, you can't have something like that come from the president of the United States and him tweet and retweet death threats from the Oval Office and not have people take that seriously. I mean, that is the environment that we're in right now. When somebody like Donald Trump says something, there are unfortunately people who will act on it. And I know this well 'cause I also lived through the insurrection on January 6. I was trapped at the House gallery while I saw Trump supporters brutally beat and try to derail our democracy. So I've seen this happen before. This is, unfortunately, the environment that Donald Trump has created for us. FADEL: Now, the White House later said the president doesn't actually want to execute members of Congress. He simply wants to hold them accountable. I want to play you a bit of what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had to say yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: To suggest and encourage that active-duty service members defy the chain of command is a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do. And they should be held accountable. And that's what the president wants to see. FADEL: Is that what you were doing in that video, asking the military to defy the chain of command? CROW: Oh, absolutely not. And they actually outright lied. Karoline Leavitt lied about what we said. What we said was U.S. law and the Constitution requires that service members only obey lawful orders, which is actually something that we are trained on from the very first days of our military career. The White House, the president, Stephen Miller and others then said the opposite of what we said and claimed that we were saying that they should disobey lawful orders, which, of course, is not at all what we did say or would ever say. So that is what they do, though. You know, they twist and contort and just lie about what people say and then weaponize it against them. And we're just never going to stop telling the truth, and we're not going to bow down from our duty. FADEL: Now, every one of you in the video have a background in military service, intelligence service. Why did you feel it was important to make this video reminding service members that they can defy illegal orders? CROW: Well, the president has made a number of very disturbing comments related to the use of the military, everything from saying he's going to go to war with Chicago to asking whether or not he could use the military to shoot peaceful protesters to suggesting that he's going to use the military at polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law. So given his statements and his lawlessness in the last 11 months, we are in an environment where things like this are very possible. They're even plausible. And then you add on top of that the fact that you have to train people before an incident, right? When I deployed my troops to Iraq in 2003, I didn't wait until they had to make a split-second decision on a mission to train them about what they had to do and what their obligation is. You train them before. I spent months training my platoon on marksmanship and small unit tactics but also the law - the law of warfare, the Geneva Convention. You cannot wait until they're in that moment. And that's what we're trying to do, is start a conversation with our troops, start a conversation with America about what could happen and what people will do and what their obligation is in that moment. FADEL: So it isn't that you are seeing illegal orders being ordered right now. It's that you're anticipating that things that are out there might come to be true? CROW: Well, I personally, and as a member of Congress, have deep concerns about a lot of the activity that the administration is undertaking. But what I'm talking about here and we were aiming at the video is... FADEL: Yeah. CROW: ...You know, what our troops, you know, our lower listed in ranking, our operational commanders might be facing in the months and years ahead if Trump indeed carries through on some of his threats. FADEL: The White House press secretary suggested your message could be punishable by law. Are you anticipating prosecution? CROW: I don't know. I mean, I'm not going to be intimidated or be made afraid. I mean, that's what they want to do. They want to silence dissent. They want the opposition to be afraid and to be intimidated. I took an oath to this country. This is a lifetime oath to do the right thing and to obey the Constitution and to enforce the Constitution. And no threats and intimidation by the president are ever going to stop me from carrying out that oath. FADEL: Democratic Congressman and former Army Ranger Jason Crow. Thank you for your time. CROW: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-escalation-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 32 Palestinians, as Hamas warns of ‘dangerous escalation’","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli airstrikes across Gaza killed at least 32 Palestinians, including 12 children and eight women, in a new escalation of violence just days after the UN endorsed a US peace plan.

Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli strikes across  Gaza  killed at least   32 Palestinians  in the latest escalation of violence since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 12 children and eight women were among those killed in the strikes, which continued from Wednesday into Thursday morning, while a further 88 people sustained injuries.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out the strikes on Hamas targets after “several terrorists” fired on Israeli soldiers operating in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement,” the IDF said, adding that none of its forces had been injured.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas condemned the strikes as “a dangerous escalation” and rejected the IDF’s account, accusing Israel of trying to “justify its ongoing crimes and violations.” It called on the US to exert “immediate, serious pressure” on Israel to “respect the ceasefire and halt the aggression against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest strikes bring the total Palestinian death toll since the ceasefire came into effect to 312.\n \n\n   \n  They come just days after the UN Security Council  endorsed  US President Donald Trump’s plan for how to move beyond the fragile truce to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in a separate development, Israel also carried out airstrikes on what it claimed were Hezbollah weapons storage sites in southern Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza were the third major escalation since the  ceasefire agreement  came into force in October, each preceded by an attack on Israeli soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  In the two previous escalations, on  October 19  and  28 , approximately 150 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were killed.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite those escalations the ceasefire has largely held.\n \n\n   \n  CNN footage taken Wednesday at Gaza City’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex shows dozens of people crowding around incoming ambulances carrying victims of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The footage shows several people sitting beside the corpses inside the hospital, some peering into the body bags in despair. One of the body bags contains the bodies of three lifeless children still covered in dust.\n \n\n   \n  The deadliest strike Wednesday was in the Zaytun area in the east of Gaza, where 10 people, including a woman and a child, were killed, Gaza Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  Another strike hit an area west of Khan Younis targeting “a group of civilians inside the UNRWA club,” the Civil Defense added.\n \n\n   \n  UNRWA is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage during an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, according to the Gaza health ministry, more than 69,000 Palestinians – most of them women and children – have been killed.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire framework, Hamas agreed to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza, living and dead, while Israel agreed to withdraw from some parts of Gaza and release some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has since released all of the living hostages and the bodies of all but three of the dead ones.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza come a day after an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in  Lebanon killed 13 people,  according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The IDF said Tuesday’s strike had targeted “a Hamas training compound” that was being used to “plan and carry out terrorist attacks against the IDF and the State of Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Israel carried out further strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting what it said were “several weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah’s rocket unit.” The strikes caused no casualties but damaged several houses, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has been carrying out strikes in  Lebanon targeting militants from Hezbollah  as well as various Palestinian militant factions for more than two years. These escalated after Iran-backed Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack. The latest strikes come despite a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah that took effect in November 2024.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Heather law contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israeli-hostage-kupershtein-gaza-captivity-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"In your head, you count every day: Ex-October 7 hostage describes 2 years in captivity","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bar Kupershtein, a 23-year-old Israeli security guard, was kidnapped on October 7, 2023, during a Hamas terror attack at the Nova Festival, and spent 738 days in captivity in Gaza under horrific conditions, including beatings, starvation, and psychological torture.

head, you count every day’: Ex-October 7 hostage describes 2 years in captivity \n       \n  By Tal Shalev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Bar Kupershtein smiles and laughs as if he hasn’t spent the last two years in “hell,” as he describes it, his demeanor belying the time he spent  in Hamas’ captivity in Gaza .\n \n\n   \n  “I prefer to take things with humor and laughter, to be happy with my family, and to look forward, not back,” the 23-year-old security guard who was kidnapped from  the Nova Festival on October 7, 2023 , told CNN, hours before boarding a flight to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the same resolve that made him stay behind during the terror attack, aiding the wounded partygoers, until he was ultimately shot and kidnapped by Hamas. Despite the enormous hardship he endured, he says he would do the exact same thing again.\n \n\n   \n  “I was responsible for the safety of all the partygoers”’ he said. “If I ran away and saved myself, knowing that others were there and I could have helped them –– I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.” Survivors have called him a hero. “I just did my job,” he insists.\n \n\n   \n  That decision cost him 738 days.\n \n\n   \n  “In your head, you count every day, that’s how you keep yourself busy,” he told CNN. In the beginning, he recalls, blindfolded and forbidden from speaking, counting was one of the only activities available. Days became weeks, months, two years.\n \n\n   \n  “There were moments when they tried to execute us, when they starved us, when they abused us, whether with beatings, physically, verbally, depriving us from basic human conditions,” he recounts. “You feel like the most miserable person in the world.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Just endure it’ or ‘It can’t get any worse than this’\n \n\n   \n  Held underground with five other hostages, in what he described as “a small dungeon,” Kupershtein recalls an especially violent period, following statements by far-right  Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir  on Palestinian prisoners. “They came to us, beat us and hit us, and when we asked why, they said it was because of Ben Gvir and because of our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2025, Hamas released  a propaganda video  showing Kupershtein and another hostage, Maxim Herkin, appearing emaciated and distressed, begging to be brought home. “All I was thinking about was that my family would know that I am alive, that’s it,” he said. “I didn’t care what they told me to say, I would say everything – just for my family to see me safe and sound and speaking.”\n \n\n   \n  In that hell, Kupershtein says his anchor was his faith.\n \n\n   \n  “God gave me the strength to be strong. I truly believed and knew that I would get out safe and sound,” he said. “From day one, I had this inner feeling. I kept telling myself not to give up and stay strong – for the family – because one day I will get out and go back to being Bar. I told myself that it can’t get any worse than this – so just endure it.”\n \n\n   \n  His faith grew even stronger during captivity.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t very religious beforehand, only traditional, but in captivity, one really connects to God, you talk to him. He saved me – not once or twice. Every day that I stayed alive was a miracle.”\n \n\n   \n  In captivity, Kupershtein had little access to the outside world and was only occasionally aware of what was happening. Even then, it was often what his captors wanted him to know.\n \n\n   \n  But a radio transmitter brought in to broadcast Quran passages to the hostages gave them an unexpected link to the outside.\n \n\n   \n  Kupershtein managed to locate an Israeli military radio station and get updates from home. “I remember waking up every morning, looking at the radio and waiting to listen to it,” he says. “It really is a miracle. Imagine you’re 30 meters (98 feet) underground and you’re listening to the radio.”\n \n\n   \n    A father’s fight for his son\n \n\n   \n  From that radio, he heard about his family’s efforts to secure his release. Kupershtein’s father, Tal, was a former volunteer paramedic for  United Hatzalah , Israel’s largest volunteer emergency medical service organization. He suffered a severe stroke in a motorcycle accident three years prior to the kidnapping. The accident made Bar, the eldest of five siblings, the family’s breadwinner, managing their falafel stand while also working as a security guard at events. He also followed in his father’s footsteps, volunteering as a paramedic.\n \n\n   \n  During his son’s captivity, Tal – who was in a wheelchair and had been unable to speak for years – engaged in an intense recovery effort with speech therapists and regained his ability to speak so he could advocate for his son’s freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw my father sometimes at demonstrations, they even brought me a picture of him standing at a demonstration,” Kupershtein says. “I also heard my mother organized a birthday for me at Hostages Square.”\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t believe his release was coming until the last minute. “There were so many deals that didn’t go through, so we thought here’s another one that won’t go through, something will mess up,” he said. “Even when I was on my way home, I didn’t believe we were actually getting out.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is on his way to the Oval Office, where the US president invited all 20 newly- freed hostages. Kupershtein, who calls Trump “an emissary of God,” plans first and foremost to thank him. “God said we needed to get out of there and he was the emissary,”, he says. “He played a big part in us getting out of there.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believes in peace, Kupershtein is measured. “Personally, yes, but after these two years I was there, I know that the other side is really not interested in peace, so as much as we as a state can want peace – I don’t think it can happen with Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  He describes himself now as an “upgraded version” of who he was before and says being back in Israel is like a daily dream.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an excitement every day to wake up in the morning here – and not there in the tunnels – and to be alive and breathing,” he said. “I thank God for this every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, underneath the smiles and the laughter, he acknowledged the wounds remain.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there are moments when I can’t fall asleep at night with hard thoughts and a need to go out for fresh air,” he admits. “Sometimes I find myself in situations where I see everyone around me happy, but I’m just regular, and it’s not true happiness.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he tries “to surround myself with a loving, supportive environment so that I don’t reach those situations and just be happy. It’s part of it, I believe it will heal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/epstein-files-ro-khanna","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Ro Khanna explains how he helped engineer the vote that 'ripped MAGA apart'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ro Khanna, a California representative and progressive Democrat, played a central role in engineering a bipartisan vote in the U.S. House to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, resulting in a 427-1 victory.

That’s a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was  perhaps the biggest defeat  of President Donald Trump’s second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”\n \n\n   \n  A group of Epstein’s survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn’t clear if he was acknowledging Khanna’s work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on  the discharge petition leading to Tuesday’s vote , were trending on X and he wasn’t. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Khanna doesn’t hide his belief that Tuesday’s triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on  legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia  for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.\n \n\n   \n  “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.\n \n\n   \n  “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?’ And it’s easier if you’re a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it’s not just ideas. I’m able to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are willing to give him credit too.\n \n\n   \n  “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we’re going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I’m used to fighting battles and not winning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He’s on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn’t for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don’t think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”\n \n\n   \n    How he strategized\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, a 49-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he’d like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.\n \n\n   \n  “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I’m not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of eggs?’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of health care?’ ‘What’s up with this?’ And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.’”\n \n\n   \n  That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she’d do it if she didn’t have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.\n \n\n   \n  To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who’ve rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”\n \n\n   \n  That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails  released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice  on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein’s final arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn’t respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna’s pushing the bill through.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who’s become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”\n \n\n   \n  “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Anger and regrets\n \n\n   \n  At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they’ve blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.\n \n\n   \n  He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn’t have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn’t have waited until Trump’s backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”\n \n\n   \n  Khanna’s father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don’t tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”\n \n\n   \n    A ‘proof of concept’\n \n\n   \n  Khanna doesn’t know if he’ll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn’t talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won’t be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors’ lawyers and former Justice officials who’ve seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire’s tax that they’ll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.\n \n\n   \n  “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,’ maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?’ This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Khanna’s age. He is 49, not 47.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5613873","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"Do You Want Out of The Cult of Homeownership?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the cultural and economic challenges of homeownership in America, questioning the viability of a proposed 50-year mortgage as a solution to affordability.

Episode Highlights Whether 50-year mortgages are a solution \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       HORSLEY: The 50-year mortgage is sort of a superficial way to try to make homeownership seem more affordable. But if you scrape just a smidge below the surface, there's not a lot of substance here. Housing affordability is a real challenge. A 50-year mortgage is not a real solution. It would have the effect, potentially, of lowering people's monthly payments a little bit… LUSE: But you have that payment way longer, right? HORSLEY: Yeah, at the cost of adding an extra 20 years. It's like saying, \"Well, your credit card payment would be a lot lower if you just make the minimum payment, but you're going to be in hock for the rest of your life.\" You'll pay a whole lot more in interest and you will take a lot longer to accumulate any equity in your home … this would really chip away at that wealth accumulation piece of home ownership. Why homeownership is still culturally important  COHEN: I think [homeownership] is offering people a sense of security, that you're not going to get kicked out of your home because you can't afford rent anymore, or that rent prices go so high that you get priced out. That makes people feel like they can stay in a place and also connects to putting down roots … I think homeownership ends up being an almost forcing mechanism to commit to where you are. For a lot of people, it's just what it means to be an adult. As there are these other kinds of markers that have become optional, like marriage, like having kids … homeownership remains, I think, pretty across the board and across the ideological spectrum, something that people really aspire to and represents that they have \"made it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A new approach to homebuying LUSE: Rhaina, you reported on friends co-buying properties together. What are some of the perks and some of the pitfalls of this pathway to homeownership? COHEN: I was really struck by data from Zillow, and there were a few other reports that were consistent on this, that about 15% of people who had bought homes in 2024, had done so with a friend or relative. The prevalence of this, and certainly the interest in this, is more common as you go to younger generations. … Everybody I talked to also had this social piece as well — they wanted the company of the person that they were living with… One of them had lived alone as a renter and had felt like she had made it, and people respected that as being independent. During the pandemic, she felt lonely … and she decided she wanted to live with others. Ultimately, that led to co-buying. Zillow did research on why people co-buy, and about a quarter of them are doing it because they don't want to live alone. That's a major reason. It's not just affordability. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615190","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00-05:00","title":"White House Condemns Democratic Lawmakers' Video But Backs Off Trump's Posts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House condemned President Donald Trump's posts on Truth Social, in which he called for the execution of Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military and intelligence personnel to refuse illegal orders.

President Trump does not actually want to see members of Congress executed despite his social media post earlier in the day, calling a video by some members \"seditious behavior, punishable by

Jason Crow, D-Colo., Chris DeLuzio, D-Pa, Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., where the lawmakers address members of the military and intelligence communities and said, \"You can refuse illegal orders,\" repeating the phrase several times before saying, \"You must refuse illegal orders.\" The lawmakers said, \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\"  The video, posted to Facebook , also says \"right now the threats of our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but right here at home.\" They added: \"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.\" Asked during the daily White House briefing if he wanted execute members of Congress, Leavitt said: \"No.\" \"The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command, and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed. It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging,\" Leavitt said. The president also reposted a series of comments from users on Truth Social, including posts that said the Democrats should be hanged, the actions were an insurrection and they should all be indicted because of the video. In the video Democrats didn't call out any specific actions that military or intelligence officials have been told to carry out. They also said that military and intelligence personnel swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. They ended the video by telling those in the military and intelligence officials, \"Don't give up the ship,\" referring to the famous last words of James Lawrence, a Navy Captain during the war of 1812, to keep fighting and not surrender. Members of the military do swear an oath to the Constitution and are trained that \"following orders\" is not a defense for illegal acts. The lawmakers issued a joint statement to Trump's response, saying in part, \"We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.\" \"Every American must unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity,\" they said. House Democratic leadership — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California — called for Trump to remove the posts and for Republicans to condemn them. \"We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump's disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same,\" they wrote. \"We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families,\" the statement adds. \"Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed.\" Trump hasn't deleted the social media posts.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599934","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"How Could Trump Interfere in the Midterms?

Here's what voting officials are watching \n         By Miles Parks \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Less than a year from the midterm elections, state and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of interference by a federal government helmed by President Trump. The problem is, no one knows what might be coming. Steve Simon, the Democratic secretary of state of Minnesota, likened it to planning for natural disasters. \"You have to use your imagination to consider and plan for the most extreme scenario,\" Simon said. Carly Koppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County in Colorado, said officials in her state are shoring up their relationships with local law enforcement and county and state attorney's offices, to make sure any effort to interfere with voting is \"met with a pretty good force of resistance.\" \"We have to plan for the worst and hope we get the best,\" Koppes said. \"I think we're all kind of conditioned at this point to expect anything and everything, and our bingo cards keep getting bigger and bigger with things that we would have never have had on them.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump, who continues to spread false claims about voting in America, issued an executive order in the spring that sought to mandate  major changes  to the elections system. That order has so far  mostly been blocked  by the courts, but he's teased other executive action as well. And his administration is still  investigating  his loss five years ago, while  pardoning  people associated with his efforts to try to overturn that defeat. All of that has made it clear to those in the elections community that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a few things voting officials are watching for. More executive action to take control of voting The Constitution is  clear : States control their own election processes, with Congress able to set guidelines for federal races. The president has virtually no authority when it comes to voting. But Trump is testing that, and those in his circle have pushed fringe theories for how he can change how ballots are cast and counted. Earlier this month , press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House is working on a new executive order that will seemingly target mail voting. Trump also said earlier this year that he wanted to  ban some voting machines , though it's unclear exactly what he was referring to. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Election officials agree he does not have the legal authority to do either of those things. But recently, Trump ally and attorney Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump in 2020, broached a bolder strategy to enact election changes: declaring a national emergency. \"The president's authority is limited in his role with regard to elections except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States — as I think that we can establish with the porous system that we have,\" Mitchell said on a  podcast appearance  in September. It would be keeping with one of Trump's broader policy strategies: This year he's invoked presidential emergency powers  more frequently  than any other modern president. Election  experts  say there's no legal basis for Mitchell's theory, but numerous voting officials told NPR it's something that's come up in conversations about next year. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who previously oversaw voting in California as secretary of state, also brought up the scenario recently on the Senate floor. \"If the Trump White House tried to declare some fake national emergency to create a pretense for federal intervention, I will force a vote here in the Senate to stop it,\" Padilla said. Troops on the ground Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, says six months ago he wouldn't have taken the premise of federal troops at polling places seriously. But seeing how the National Guard was deployed — and justified — this summer changed his thinking. \"You have National Guard deploying to cities to supposedly quell these 'demonstrations' — basically  people in frog suits  and riding their  bikes naked  is the biggest threat,\" Hobbs said. \"And yeah, I start thinking that maybe it could be possible.\" Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump  spoke of  a desire to have federal law enforcement patrol voting locations, and this year, his former adviser Steve Bannon said on his  War Room podcast  that he hopes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are patrolling polling places in the midterms. Legal  experts  say such intervention is clearly illegal, but until the federal government disavows such actions clearly, Simon said voting officials have to game out how to respond. \"One thing that would help is if someone at the federal government would come out and categorically say, 'No, no, no, stop the presses, stop everything. You'll never have to worry about that. That's not something we would ever consider doing,'\" Simon said. \"That would go a long way.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to questions about forces outside polling places, and other scenarios mentioned in this story, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson characterized them as \"baseless conspiracy theories and Democrat talking points\" but did not directly answer whether the White House would commit not to send agents to voting locations. She reiterated that the president is permitted to send federal personnel to localities to help quell violent crime. Who is a trusted source? For the last decade, as voting officials have fought to dam up a tsunami of false information about their work, they've begged people in their communities to go to \"trusted sources\" for election information. In 2026, figuring out who is a trusted source may be more difficult than ever. Along with Trump himself, his administration has elevated to prominent government roles  numerous people  who have a history of spreading false information about elections, and local officials worry their message may be drowned out by those with much bigger megaphones. One of the hires alarming voting officials interviewed by NPR works at the Department of Homeland Security. Heather Honey, who's now deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity, worked alongside Mitchell for the past few years to help  spread election conspiracy theories , including one about votes in Pennsylvania that  Trump mentioned  in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a mob stormed the Capitol. \"I equate this to having a moon landing conspiracy theorist and flat earther being offered a job at NASA,\" Hobbs said. DHS did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Numerous   officials  at the Department of Justice also have a history of election denial. Unprecedented demands The insistence to  relitigate  2020 also has voting officials worried about what sort of actions administration officials plan to take. Already this year, DOJ has made unprecedented requests to investigate  voting machines ,  access  old ballots, and  accumulate  mass amounts of voter data. This summer, a  consultant  in Colorado contacted Koppes and other clerks in that state, in some cases saying he was associated with the White House and asking about accessing their voting machines. The White House denied to  CNN  and  other outlets  authorizing the requests, but separately,  in Missouri , a Department of Justice official reached out to clerks there asking basically the same thing. In each instance, they were told no. \"Since 2020, people in the elections world have become even more knowledgeable of the responsibilities of the different levels of government [when it comes to voting equipment],\" Koppes said. A similar push and pull is playing out with elections data. The Trump administration has quickly built what is essentially a  searchable national citizenship database , and is trying to entice states to run their voting records through it to root out noncitizens on voter rolls. While many Republican election officials have eagerly embraced the system, other GOP officials and their Democratic counterparts have been  hesitant to engage with the tool , as there are questions about how well it works, what happens to the voting data once it's been run through the system and, in many states, whether even using the tool is legal under state law. Still, the administration is intent to investigate voter rolls as it continues to push  false narratives  about widespread noncitizen voting. The DOJ recently  sued  eight states (all states Trump lost in 2020) in an effort to compel them to turn over their rolls. \"It's really not a red state or blue state thing,\" said Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of state of Pennsylvania, in an  interview with PBS News Hour  about the data demands. \"It is a — in my view, a concerning attempt, a concerning effort to consolidate and overreach at the federal level. In the United States of America, it's the states who run elections, not the federal government.\" Vulnerable targets Since Trump took office, the federal government has pulled back on virtually all of its work related to cybersecurity and elections. The Department of Homeland Security  laid off  employees focused on election security, and stopped  funding  a partnership that helped local elections offices share threat information. Wesley Wilcox, a Republican election supervisor in Marion County, Fla., said smaller counties especially will be more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the cuts, and Russia, China or any other U.S. adversary may see an opportunity. \"That's what I would do,\" Wilcox said. \"I mean, if I were on that side of the fence, I'm like, 'OK, they're cutting this stuff out.

You don't notice it until one day — bam! — the impact is clear, and it's not pleasant. When did you decide to join all these subscription services? Have you always shopped online so frequently? When did you go from batch-cooking dinner to getting sushi delivered? Without much thought, all these charges add up to a much larger bill at the end of the month. This uncomfortable growth is called \"lifestyle creep\" or \"lifestyle inflation,\" and it happens when you have access to more money.  \n       \n      Related Story:  How to ask for a raise: Know your value (and bring the evidence) \n       Maybe you've advanced in your career and have a higher salary. Or maybe during the pandemic, you've had fewer expenses and more discretionary income. Perhaps you've moved in with a partner and are sharing expenses. However you got here, now you have more cash in your bank account, and instead of investing or saving it, you've only ballooned the cost of your lifestyle. Writer, artist and financial planner  Paco de Leon  shares tips about how to manage your money, as well as your emotions, to achieve inner wealth and prevent lifestyle creep. \n       \n      Related Story:  It's A Good Time To Save More. Here's How \n       Save money dynamically If you're making more money, your savings rate should also increase. Adjust how much you save based on what you earn. If you have the option, ask your employer to make a direct deposit into your savings account so that the saved money is automatically set aside. During times of inflation, it may be harder to do this, but always pay attention to how much you're saving and whether it's going up with how much you're earning. \n       \n      Related Story:  Spend savvier, save smarter: 5 tips to stop stress-spending \n       Avoid impulse purchases with  a \"buy list\" To avoid impulse purchases, make yourself what de Leon calls a \"buy list.\" Put the items you desire on a list. Then, after a predetermined time (like a week or a month), if you still want that thing, go ahead and buy it. You can even build the concept of shopping off your buy list into your life so you have items and experiences to look forward to. De Leon says a buy list \"re-creates the experience of shopping\" but prevents her from buying things carelessly. Know that it's OK to treat yourself sometimes It's OK to spend some of your money on yourself! Staying strict with your spending can cause you to \"explode in ways that are not so great,\" says de Leon. To \"satiate the beast,\" she gives you permission to treat yourself. Just do so thoughtfully. Ask yourself, \"How do I expect this purchase will make me feel? What do I want it to make me feel? What feelings am I trying to  avoid  by buying it?\" Asking yourself these questions before treating yourself can help you avoid the \" hedonic treadmill \" — the never-ending pursuit of one \"thing\" to bring us happiness after another. Although buying a gift for yourself can give you pleasure initially,  research suggests  you often return to how you felt before — that is, until you settle on a new \"thing\" to make you feel happy and the cycle begins again. \n       \n      Related Story:  Our relationship with money is emotional. How to make the most of your cash \n       Ask yourself: What is enough? Lifestyle creep can show up in both our tiny lifestyle choices and our big ones. Everything from a daily coffee habit to a desire to live in a single-family home is a reflection of the life we want for ourselves and how much we're willing to spend to achieve that lifestyle. When you're thinking about what will make you happy, de Leon says to be careful about measuring contentment through a consumerist lens, because it's rarely just one thing that will make you happy. You may think you want just a nice jacket, she says, but then you need attractive shoes to go with the jacket. When you're on the hedonic treadmill, it's never just one thing. The antidote to lifestyle creep, de Leon says, is deeply considering the answer to the question, \"What is enough?\" Often, our life goals are this moving target, says de Leon. To decouple these goals from material things, think about how you want your life to feel on a daily basis. Ask yourself what would truly make you happy and joyful. What would that cost you? How much money do you need to make, how much money do you need to save for emergencies and what do you need to invest for the future?  Use these answers as building blocks to get to a place where you can appreciate what you have instead of always desiring more. \n       \n      Related Story:  How to talk about money, privilege with friends — before it's time to split the bill \n       Work on your mental and emotional health \"Our relationship with money is a mirror,\" says de Leon. \"How we choose to spend or not spend our money is a reflection of how we feel about ourselves.\" Insecurity, jealousy and other negative emotions can lead us to spend money needlessly. Take care of yourself so that when you have to make financial decisions, you're in a clear state of mind and less easily influenced by outside factors. A good night's sleep, breathing deeply, listening to music that makes you feel happy and spending time with people who appreciate you for you can go a long way.  \"The more you work on your relationship with yourself,\" says de Leon, \"the more you're going to see your relationship across all other things in your life improve.\" Listen to Life Kit on  Apple Podcasts  and  Spotify ,  or sign up for our  newsletter .

There are some unpleasant things in life that can sneak up on us, things that come with warning signs but are subtle and easy to ignore. Maybe it's a deadline for an upcoming paper or mold in a tub of yogurt you've left in your fridge. In the world of personal finance, there's this phenomenon that has the same effect of all those things. It's called lifestyle creep. PACO DE LEON: Lifestyle creep is this phenomenon that happens. When you start to earn more money, you also start to spend more money. TAM: This is Paco de Leon, a writer, illustrator and the author of the book, \"Finance For The People.\" Like an advancing deadline or mold in your fridge, you don't notice your rising expenses until, all of a sudden, you're shocked when your credit card bill is more than it's ever been. When you have a very limited budget, this might be less likely to happen to you. But when you start to make a little more money and don't have to eyeball your bank account after every purchase, that's when the cost of your lifestyle can begin to creep up and start matching your salary. For some of us, COVID may have contributed to this. You moved into an apartment with cheaper rent when buildings were running deals and you weren't spending all this money on commuting. And now your landlord is raising your rent to pre-pandemic rates and inflation is making everything more expensive. DE LEON: If you have lifestyle creep, that means that your expenses are meeting basically how much you're earning, and you're not typically saving more or you're not typically investing more. You are typically spending more. TAM: So on this episode of LIFE KIT, how to manage your money and your emotions to avoid lifestyle creep. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAM: What are common ways lifestyle creep surprises people? Let's get some examples out here. DE LEON: Sure. Housing is such a huge cost, right? The cost of rent is something that seems to just be creeping up and creeping up because it is a function of supply and demand. And so I think folks who are younger, maybe they might not mind having one or five roommates, right? There's this, like, idea in society that the older you get, you shouldn't have roommates - right? - and so I think that's one way people experience lifestyle creep is they get a studio apartment or they get a one-bedroom or, you know, they want to even upgrade. But this could even happen on a smaller scale, like going out to dinner. Lifestyle creep can be seen from folks who maybe they pack their lunch most days of the week and they start to make more money. They feel, like, a little more coin in their pocket and they feel a little more flush with cash. And they might, you know, start going out to sushi for lunch in the middle of the week. And that's another way that we see lifestyle creep. TAM: So I'm in my 30s, and my friends' lifestyles at this point really run a wide spectrum. Like, I've got friends renting group houses and also friends who are buying homes and having kids. So I guess I'm wondering, what does keeping up with the Joneses look like when you're in your 30s in 2022? DE LEON: I mean, I definitely want to call out that you're living, like, an intersectional experience just by virtue of who you are, it seems like. And that's how, you know, I am, as well. And I think that's great because it gives us all these different perspectives, and it doesn't necessarily need to push us into one way of being, right? And I think that needs to be done more often. I think we need to be interacting with different people all the time so that we cannot just see one narrative, one story, one path and then internalize that and then feel bad - or badly when we can't follow that path for whatever reason, be it circumstance or individual choice. So I guess I don't know what keeping up with the Joneses looks like in 2022. I think maybe this is, like, overly optimistic and maybe even naive, but I think we have the ability to choose what we're consuming and how we are letting that impact how we think and project our ideas of who we are into the future. TAM: I think it's easy to have your guard up for big things like, you know, whether or not you buy a car, for example, or whether or not you go from living in a group house to a one-bedroom. But I think there's a reason why this term is called lifestyle creep. How do smaller purchases and smaller decisions wind up contributing to what we're calling lifestyle creep in quieter ways? DE LEON: Sometimes when we buy one nice thing, we think that's not going to cause a ricochet or a domino effect where we're going to need other nice things or want other nice things. But it often happens. And, you know, I've seen it happen with me. I've bought - I'm like, OK, I'll - I'm going to buy some not-secondhand clothes for the first time in years. And as soon as I did that, I was like, well, now I need cleaner shoes or nicer shoes, you know? So, like, before you make a purchase, if you could catch yourself and ask yourself, you know, what it is you want to feel by making that purchase or what you want to avoid feeling by making that purchase. And I think if you learn how to catch yourself and think about buying in that - you know, in that sense, I think that's a good way to avoid lifestyle creep. TAM: Yeah, I think it's also really challenging because not only do you have to be mindful, but a lot of people turn to these treats - whether they're small purchases or big purchases - as a bit of, like, retail therapy, like, that treat-yourself mindset like you were talking about. I was going to share that, you know, I think the - one of the weaknesses for me is just, like, skin care or makeup. There's this idea, like, oh, you can't just wash your face. You must moisturize it, tone it, hydrate it with serums and various acids. It's never just one thing, right? DE LEON: It's never just one thing. And, you know, you're pointing to the truth that consumerism is, like - you know, we're in lockstep with it with all these other isms, right? So you're, like, looking at ageism, but we're looking at it through a consumer's lens. I don't expect people to sit back and untangle this spiderweb and, you know, save $50 every time. But we're kind of being pushed and pulled in all these different ways that we are maybe unaware of. And maybe that's just the first step of personal change that can ultimately lead to a larger change. TAM: OK. Speaking of, you know, thinking about the future, I think a lot of people are trying to earn money to be able to afford a better lifestyle for ourselves and our loved ones. And, you know, they're - upgrading your life in some way can be a part of that. And so I guess I'm wondering if you could share more about the differences between earning and saving money in order to achieve certain goals in your life and lifestyle creep, which - I understand it to be kind of like slowly accumulating a bunch of maybe big and small expenses that wind up increasing your cost of living in a sneakier way. DE LEON: I think the most challenging thing that we're all faced with when it comes to making a living, earning and how much we're saving and investing for the future is there's a sense of lifestyle creep when it comes to our goals. So many times, our goals are this moving target - right? - and we tell ourselves - I'm just going to use general numbers - we tell ourselves, if I could just, you know, make $3,000 a month, I'll be good. I'll be happy. I'll be fine. I'll feel safe. I'll feel secure. I'll be able to save, and I'll be able to meet my needs. And then we get there and we think, huh, well, what if I earn $5,000? I think if I earn $5,000 a month, then I'll really feel like I can then, you know, get some nicer things, do some upgrades. And so now we're just looking at that way of thinking - right? - progress through this very consumerist, modern lens. And I think that's what's going on. I think the biggest challenges that we're going to face that have a huge ripple effect on things like climate change, are - is this idea of enough. TAM: One of the times that we're most vulnerable to lifestyle creep is when you experience some sort of windfall - like, if you get one big bonus or, you know, your annual raise or you're given a gift or something. What can you do with that, as opposed to upgrading your life instantly or immediately kind of splurging to celebrate? DE LEON: Well, when you get a windfall, I would say you should spend a little bit of it. I feel like if you are being so militant sometimes with your finances, it builds this pressure and it could explode in ways that are not great. So I think that when you get a windfall, you know, 1% or 2, 3%, you know, buy something that you've been wanting to buy. And I think that can help, like, satiate, maybe this, like, beast within us that wants to go crazy, right? So I want to give people permission in that regard. But I do think that - here's the traditional financial advice. You get a 3% raise. Great. Save that 3%. You know, increase your savings rate by the amount that you are being paid by. But right now, in this very moment, we're seeing that that's not possible for a lot of people because of the rate of inflation, right? So these textbooks' ideas for what one ought to be doing with their money, they're great. But life is dynamic, and things are always changing. And sometimes it's not possible. So I just want to address that reality. Let's say things are not - we're not in the 9, 8% inflationary environment. There's a really important concept to understand called the hedonic treadmill or - it's also called human adaptation. Basically, what it states is that, you know, life has its ups and downs, and good things happen and bad things happen. And that affects our level of happiness but only in the short term. Ultimately, over time, our levels of happiness are going to kind of remain around the same level, regardless of what happens. So I think when you know that, when you understand that upgrading to a nicer car might feel good, ultimately, in the long run, you're probably going to end up feeling the same. So I don't want to say it's a waste of money because somebody might appreciate it every single day, their really nice car, and it might improve their life. But for the most part, most people, you know, they just go back to feeling the same. TAM: I think that's super true. You might get, like, a spike of, you know, endorphins, like, oh, fun new thing. I get to try it. Yay. Like, it's a sparkly new item in my life. And, you know, it might be important enough to you that you get that boost every time you use it or wear it or try it or whatever it is. But ultimately, you kind of - you level out. DE LEON: Yes, you level out. I had one practical tip that I've been using that I think is really helpful. And I use this particularly with, like, Instagram when I get prompted to buy something and I know that I am feeling some kind of way about it. I put it on a list - and it's really silly and simple - I just call it a buy list. And I make it handsome and cute, my buy list. And, like, I organize it in a way that feels good so that when I open it up, it just feels nice. It feels like shopping, right? So I'm recreating this experience of shopping. I'll take the picture of the item that I want, and I'll put it on the buy list, and I'll put a little description. I'll put a little price. I'll put the day that I started to covet this item. And then I have these rules - right? - the rule is I cannot buy anything on the buy list until it's been on the list for as little as 24 hours. Really, for me, it's, like, a month, right? If I still feel some kind of way about this object in one month and it's on my list, I'll buy it. There's been very few things I've bought off this buy list. It feels good enough to just put it on the list. And I think it confuses my brain, and it feels good. It feels like I'm buying it without buying it. And I don't know if that will work for everyone, but I suggest trying it for a while and seeing how that works. TAM: It's helpful to avoid this kind of just, like, impulse buying. Like... DE LEON: Yes. TAM: ...Oh, I really just want to feel, like, excited right now. And I can relate to that. I 100% get that. DE LEON: Exactly. TAM: We've talked about this before, but, you know, just because you can afford something in the moment - like, let's say you do get a raise at your current position, and you can afford a wider range of things than you could before. You're - one thing that I feel a little hyperaware of sometimes is just because you can afford something right now because of your current salary doesn't mean that you're going to be able to afford it, you know, five years down the line or whatever. So if you get something like a fancy new phone, for example, and you're still paying it off later or the next iteration of the phone is going to be even more expensive or whatever, how do you not lock yourself into a type of lifestyle that you may not actually be able to afford later if something happens with your employment or your job? DE LEON: I think it all comes down to, like, being mindful, again, at the end of the day - like, pausing, really thinking about the consequences of the decision that you're making and not just the first order of consequences but the second and third order of consequences. Like, I don't want to scare people, but my background as a financial planner makes me always think, well, what's the worst thing that could happen if I lease this car, or what's the craziest thing that could happen if I borrow this money from the bank? When you think about worst-case scenarios like that, if you can do it in a way that doesn't make you spiral out, that data is really important because it helps you weigh risk, and it helps you weigh the possibility and the probability that that risk could actually happen in your life. One of the ways that my mindset shifted from when I worked for somebody and then when I started working for myself, was I realized that security, when working for somebody else, is an illusion. Like, they could one day say, you know what, Paco? You need to get out of here, and all of my income is taken away in one fell swoop, versus working as a freelancer or small-business owner, where you're working with multiple clients, and you have multiple projects. And sure, that brings its own flavor of chaos but the trade-off is when one thing quiets down or one client lets you go or you let a client go, it's not one person coming and taking away your entire livelihood. I think one of the things we all need to start considering as an antidote to this lifestyle creep is what is enough? What is enough for us? And in America, it feels like there's this pervasive idea that there's never going to be enough. You can always have more. TAM: Yeah, I'm wondering, like, how to break apart that question in a practical way. Like, it seems like a really scary - honestly, a scary question to ask yourself, like, what is ever going to be enough? And I'm wondering if there are maybe smaller ways to get to that understanding of what is enough for ourselves? DE LEON: Yeah. TAM: Do you have smaller questions to get to that place of understanding? DE LEON: I think knowing what you want your life to look like day-to-day is going to be a key component, right? What is going to bring you happiness and joy and make you feel like you're doing what you need to do here on planet Earth, and what is that going to cost you at the end of the day? That's going to be the fundamental building block of how much money do I need to make, how much money do I need to save for emergencies, and how much money do I need to save and invest for the future, right? That's going to be kind of the baseline. I think it's important to just be present as much as we can, to take deep breaths when we're freaked out about the future and to appreciate what we have in the moment. I think the very practical aspect of knowing the math, running the processes of earning money every week or every other week, every month, saving and investing periodically - that's very practical and very helpful. I think it'll make people feel like they can tackle this question of enough. But then appreciating what you've got right now, regardless of where you are on your journey is another kind of weird way but a very practical way to make us foster that sense of enoughness (ph). TAM: We've already talked about this at length, but I just want to - you know, the reason why I love talking to you about money is because you have these, like, a combination of, like, hard budgeting tips but also, like, thoughtful, emotional ones, too because, you know, as I've learned from you and your book, being thoughtful about money has to do a lot with how we handle our emotions, how we act on our values. You know, there might be times in your life where you're fine living in a shared house with roommates, and then all of a sudden you look around, and you're like, wait, you know, my friends are starting to move out to one-bedrooms, or they're buying houses, or they're eating at these places. They're wearing this type of clothing. And it can make you feel some sort of way. And even if you are, you know, mostly content with your life, how do you address things like jealousy? How do you be honest with yourself about what you're coveting and how to tap into the part of you that is actually content or wants to be content? DE LEON: So when I was walking over to my office this morning, preparing for this interview, I put on a song - I have a playlist called a hype playlist, and it's hours of music that immediately makes me feel good. And I started doing this when I started writing my book because writing a book is very painful. It requires a tremendous amount of discipline and effort. And so what I would do is I would arrange, like, my whole morning, my whole day around feeling good so that I would do this thing, so that I would sit down and write. So I would wake up, and I would stretch my body, and I would, you know, sit and meditate because I'm one of those annoying people. I would eat, like, healthy things that are absorbed into my bloodstream in a way that doesn't spike up my energy too much, that makes me feel satiated. I would drink enough water. I mean, all these really baseline things have a huge impact on what you're able to do in your day-to-day life. And I know that sounds really mundane and silly and even stupid to recommend these things, but I think if we start with that - right? - getting enough sleep, breathing deeply, doing those little things makes a big difference, right? These non-financial things can actually help us feel like, OK, I can have a clear mind. When I'm looking at my friend's nice things or seeing her vacation on Instagram, I can - at least you've done all these baseline things so that your body is being taken care of so that your mind can then be as clear as possible. Again, it sounds so silly, and it has, like, kind of nothing to do with money, but it has everything to do with feeling like you are enough for yourself, right? I think at the end of the day, so much of how we choose to spend our money or not spend our money is a reflection of how we feel about ourselves. So I think the more you work on your relationship with yourself, the more you're going to see your relationship across all these other things in your life improve. TAM: Oh, that was perfect. I want to cry. DE LEON: (Laughter). TAM: Thank you so much. That was really beautiful, and I felt, you know, just practically - very useful. Next time I find myself in an online shopping cart - right? - or next time I'm browsing a rack or scanning, you know, a Sephora display, I'm going to have those words in my head. So thank you so much for all that practical but also emotional and personal advice. I really appreciate it. DE LEON: You know what? Thanks for having me on and being willing to, like, just get super weird about money. I really - I love talking to you, and I love that you're willing to go there with me. TAM: Always. That was Paco de Leon, a writer, illustrator and author of the book, \"Finance For The People.\" (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAM: Here are some tips from my conversation with Paco. If you can afford to, increase your savings rate according to what you're being paid. That way, if you start to make more money, you're not saving the same amount when you were making less. It's OK to treat yourself now and then, but to cut down on impulse purchases, create what Paco calls a buy list. Basically, when you want something, put it on a list that you can reference when you want to treat yourself, and only purchase things that have been on that list for a set amount of time, like two weeks or a month. Ask yourself, what is enough? What does it take for you to feel happy and secure? Try to check yourself if those answers change when you're around people with other lifestyles or if you start to make more money. And remember, how we choose to spend or not spend our money is a reflection of the relationship we have with ourselves. At the end of the day, work on your mental and emotional health so that you're in a good position to make financial decisions.

JO ANNA BROOM: Hi, my name is Jo Anna Broom (ph). When I buy items that I need to save the receipt for, I keep my receipt attached to my item by putting them in a Ziploc bag to keep them from being damaged and then getting all the air out and folding it and then taping it to the side or bottom. That way, if I need to access it, it's attached to my item and out of sight.

The crowning came after Bosch walked out of a sash ceremony in protest when director Nawat Itsaragrisil allegedly called her 'dumb' and used security to remove her. This incident, which sparked international outcry, was followed by the resignation of two judges—Claude Makélélé and Omar Harfouch—due to personal or ethical concerns, including allegations of a secret vote that pre-selected contestants.

PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Fátima Bosch of Mexico has won this year's scandal-plagued Miss Universe competition, just days after she walked out of one of its events in protest. Bosch, 25, was crowned the new Miss Universe on Friday, capping off a chaotic few weeks of drama — both on and off the pageant stage. It started before the competition officially began, in an early November sash ceremony that was  livestreamed on Facebook . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In it, Nawat Itsaragrisil — a Thai media personality and businessman who at that point was the pageant's director — stood in front of a room of begowned contestants, microphone in hand, and berated Bosch for not participating in some of its promotional activities. When Bosch stood up and tried to respond, Itsaragrisil called security to escort her out. She walked out of the room, followed by several other contestants including then-reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. Bosch  told Thai media afterward  that the director \"called me dumb because he has problems with the organization,\" which she said was unfair \"because I'm here and I do everything … and I'm just trying to [give] my best.\" \"And I think that the world needs to see this, because we are empowered women and this is a platform for our voice,\" she added. \"And no one can shut our voice, and no one will do that to me.\" At a press conference, a  tearful Itsaragrisil  said he had not called Bosch a \"dumbhead,\" as was widely reported, but was rather speaking about \"damage\" her behavior caused. He also apologized — to Bosch, whom he did not name, and fans —  onstage at a preliminary event  the next day, saying the \"pressure is a lot and I am … human.\" But the fallout continued. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Miss Universe Organization (MUO) President Raúl Rocha criticized him in a  six-minute video , in which he said Itsaragrisil, who is also the director of Miss Universe Thailand, \"has forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\" by showing the women a lack of respect \"in addition to the serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenseless woman, trying to silence and exclude her.\" \"Nawat, you need to stop,\" Rocha declared, adding there would be legal and corporate consequences from the organization. Rocha also said he would restrict Itsaragrisil's participation in the pageant, \"limiting it as much as possible or eliminating it entirely,\" though the two were  photographed together  at pageant events as recently as Thursday. In the final round of the pageant on Friday,  Bosch was asked  how she would use the title of Miss Universe to \"create a safe space for women around the world.\" \"As a woman and as Miss Universe, I would put my voice in the power and the service of others,\" she replied. \"We are here to speak up, to make change … because we are women, and the brave ones that stand up are the ones that will make history.\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum — the first woman to hold that position — applauded Bosch's win at her daily press briefing on Friday. \"I like that she spoke up when she felt that was an injustice and that is an example,\" Sheinbaum said, according to the  Associated Press . \"That thing they said about being prettier when you're quiet has been left behind. Women are prettier when we speak and we participate.\" Quitting judges, rigging allegations and a contestant's hospitalization The confrontation between Itsaragrisil and Bosch put Miss Universe in the spotlight weeks before the pageant kicked off. But recent days have brought even more scrutiny. This week, just before the pageant began, two out of the eight judges abruptly quit on Tuesday, just hours apart. One, French soccer player-turned-coach  Claude Makélélé , said he would not be able to attend the event \"due to unforeseen personal reasons.\" The other, Lebanese-French composer Omar Harfouch, has been much more vocal about his departure, alleging that the competition was rigged. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Harfouch alleged in a number of videos and  Instagram posts   that two days before the final, a \"secret vote was held to pre-select 30 contestants out of the 136,\" carried out by individuals who were not official jury members. \"I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,\" he wrote. The Miss Universe Organization responded with a  lengthy statement  denying Harfouch's accusations and suggesting he may have been referring to the selection committee of its \"Beyond the Crown Program,\" a separate social impact initiative with its own judging panel. \"The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,\" it wrote. When the  preliminary events  finally got underway on Wednesday, they were not without incident either. During the evening gown round, Miss Jamaica Gabrielle Henry  fell off the stage  toward the end of her walk. Social media  videos showed her  being taken away on a stretcher. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Henry did not compete in the finals. On Friday, Rocha, the organization president, said in an  Instagram update  that he had just visited her and her family in a Bangkok hospital, where she is under observation but has no broken bones. Since 2024, the Miss Universe Organization has been jointly owned by the Thai media company JKN and Legacy Holding Group USA Inc., a division of a Mexican company owned by Rocha. It has changed ownership multiple times since its creation in 1952, including a nearly two-decade stretch under now-President Trump that ended in 2015. The organization has struggled with  declining viewership  and  financial instability  in recent years, as well as broader questions around relevance, objectification and inclusivity in the modern age. Its host country changes frequently, and Puerto Rico's Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón  announced Friday  that the island will host the competition next year. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5616284","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"14:13:00Z","title":"The female crash test dummy has been a long time coming — but she isn't here yet","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. has long relied on male-based crash test dummies, leading to concerns that women are more vulnerable to injury in car crashes due to anatomical differences.

And she's not at the end of the road yet. Vehicle safety tests in the U.S. use crash test dummies based on a male body. Advocates say it's no coincidence that women are more likely to suffer injuries in car crashes than men, even if you control for the severity of the crash and the size of the vehicle. Calls for an accurate female crash test dummy date back decades.  Consumer Reports  has  traced them back to 1980 . In the early 2000s, regulators added a small \"female\" dummy to tests — but it was just a scaled-down version of the male dummy, with breasts attached. That doesn't reflect the real anatomical differences between male and female bodies. Around the same time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) started thinking about creating a more accurate female dummy. For more than a decade, NHTSA has worked with Humanetics, the leading manufacturer of crash test dummies, to develop, build and test the dummy that the Trump administration unveiled this week. The new dummy is called the THOR-05F, or Test device for Human Occupant Restraint, 5th-percentile Female. (That is to say, a very small woman.) It's actually based on the female body. \"The pelvis for a female is more rounded and does not hold the seatbelt the same way,\" says Chris O'Connor, the CEO of manufacturing company Humanetics. He also pointed to anatomical differences in the neck, and significant differences in the lower leg that are correlated with much higher rates of leg injuries in women. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The dummy's design had previously been embraced by some regulators overseas, with European officials indicating plans to add it to tests within a few years. But it had been stuck in limbo in the U.S., where for several years NHTSA said that more testing and consideration was required before formally adopting the dummy. Adding a new dummy to the crash testing process will be costly — aside from the costs of development, individual dummies can each cost more than $1 million. The new design also won't necessarily represent all women; it has been criticized for being extremely small, rather than reflecting an average body size. Some safety groups  have argued  that using computer simulations, which can model bodies of various sizes, is a good way to diversify testing, although others say that having better real-life crash test data to feed  into  those models is essential. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So the road to this week's announcement from the Department of Transportation has been winding. \"This is a long overdue step toward the full adoption of this new dummy for use in our safety ratings and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards,\" wrote NHTSA administrator Jonathan Morrison. And the publication of technical documents and specifications is, indeed, just one step. A final rule still has to be published, and then the new dummy \"will be considered\" for inclusion in actual safety tests, the Department of Transportation writes in its  press release . Those tests have not yet been rewritten to include the new design. Women Drive Too, an advocacy group that has long pushed for the use of female crash test dummies, welcomed the news in measured tones. \"We applaud this action, but by itself, it won't be enough,\" the coalition  wrote in a statement . They're still pushing for Congress to pass a law that requires the dummies actually get used in real-life crash tests. After decades of planning, the use of the new dummies in actual federal testing is almost certainly still years away. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609005","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Artists Speak Out Across the Country in Fall of Freedom Movement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Artists across the United States are participating in a nationwide initiative called Fall of Freedom, which they describe as a form of creative resistance to authoritarianism and political suppression. More than 600 events have been announced in 40 states, from Alaska to Florida, involving diverse artistic expressions such as performances, zine-making, and public discussions. The movement was initiated by visual artist Dread Scott and organized in partnership with playwright Lynn Nottage and the arts organization For Freedoms.

Participants include major cultural figures like John Legend, Ava DuVernay, Bill T. Jones, and Ann Patchett, and local events are taking place in towns like Homer, Portland, and Cheyenne.

Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright  Lynn Nottage , one of the organizers, said she is already seeing cultural institutions decline to program work that may be targeted as controversial or politically out of step. \"What we've encountered with regard to large museums is that they feel very fearful of retribution from the government,\" she said. \"There are more nos than yeses because of anticipatory obedience. Artists aren't afraid, but the institutions are afraid, and they are beginning to make decisions based on their fear of losing grants and losing their major donors. And that trickles down to the artists who are beginning to lose opportunities. As a result, exhibitions are being canceled. Plays are not being programmed.\" The idea for Fall of Freedom originated with visual artist Dread Scott, who approached her with an idea for \"an artistic action.\" Nottage said it was a lifeline. She said she had been feeling \"very paralyzed by how quickly things were shifting in this country. I knew I wanted to respond to the rising tide of fascism, but wasn't sure how. And then when he asked me to be part of Fall of Freedom, I thought, 'Yes, this is a beautiful organizing principle.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Scott's idea was to give artists an open-ended framework in which to use their creativity to speak to this moment. \"Part of what we're doing is trying to change the dynamic where these individual institutions are trying to make decisions for their own individual survival and trying to figure out how to sort of continue to make work under fascism,\" Scott said. \"And we're trying to say, 'No, actually, let's all stand up. They might be able to pick one or two of us off, but they can't get us all if we all collectively stand together.'\" Scott observed that art has always been a catalyst in social movements and political protests. \"I tell people that, you know, what would the civil rights movement have looked like without Billie Holiday doing ' Strange Fruit' ? Or what would the resistance to fascism have looked like without Picasso painting  Guernica ?\" He added, \" The Clash  and  Public Enemy  were deeply meaningful to me as a young art student trying to make my way in a world that I could see that was really terrible. …. Those musicians gave me license to say, 'No, the world is what's crazy, not you.'\" Fall of Freedom came about quickly, which Chicago-based artist and activist  Jenny Kendler  says she appreciated. \"You see how long it can take to develop cultural programs,\" she said. \"If I'm doing a museum show, we're planning it two years out. But we don't have that amount of time right now. We need to be responsive to this moment.\" Along with Scott and Nottage, other marquee names participating include musician John Legend, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, choreographer Bill T. Jones, and author Ann Patchett. Communities can also participate in zine making in Homer, Alaska, see a performance of the musical  Les Miserables  in Portland, Maine, and go to a dance party in Cheyenne, Wyo. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Moscow Contemporary , an arts organization in Moscow, Idaho – a city of about 27,000 people — is planning two days of events, including a roundtable discussion on civil disobedience and an open mic night.

He said you can think of the \"fall\" in the name Fall of Freedom as a decline – or as part of a cycle, or season. \"This is the  fall  of freedom,\" he said. \"And it's quite likely a winter of freedom that we're going to have to continue to struggle through.

More than 600 Fall of Freedom events have been announced. NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas spoke with some of the artists. ERIC GOTTESMAN: I think the reality is that both artists and institutions right now are feeling this fear. And we're feeling unmoored about what we are supposed to do. ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: That's Eric Gottesman. He's a visual artist based in Washington, D.C. He's also co-executive director of For Freedoms, an arts organization that promotes civic engagement. He says artists and arts presenters are feeling scared and isolated after incidents like the firings of programming staff at the Kennedy Center and an executive order requiring an audit of Smithsonian museums. In August, President Trump posted on social media that museums all over the country are, quote, \"the last remaining segment of woke.\" That's where Fall of Freedom is stepping in. Two of the organizers are visual artist Dread Scott and playwright Lynn Nottage. LYNN NOTTAGE: Dread approached me with an idea for an artistic action. And I was myself feeling very paralyzed by how quickly things were shifting in this country and knew I wanted to respond to the rising tide of fascism but wasn't sure how. And then, when he asked me to be part of Fall of Freedom, I thought, yes, this is a beautiful organizing principle. TSIOULCAS: Dread Scott's idea was to give artists an open-ended framework in which to use their creativity to speak to this moment. He says it's happening at a time when many cultural institutions, like museums and live event presenters, seem to be cowed by current politics. DREAD SCOTT: These individual institutions are trying to make decisions for their own individual survival and trying to figure out how to sort of continue to make work under fascism. And we're trying to say, no, actually, let's all stand up. They might be able to pick one or two of us off, but they can't get us all if we all collectively stand together. TSIOULCAS: Dread Scott says art has always been a catalyst in social movements and political protests. SCOTT: What would the Civil Rights Movement have looked like without Billie Holiday doing \"Strange Fruit\"? Or what would the resistance to fascism have looked like without Picasso painting Guernica? TSIOULCAS: Other marquee names who are participating in the Fall of Freedom include musician John Legend, filmmaker Ava DuVernay and author Ann Patchett. But it's also zine-making in Homer, Alaska, a performance of the musical \"Les Miserables\" in Portland, Maine, and a dance party in Cheyenne, Wyoming. An arts organization in Moscow, Idaho - a city of about 27,000 people - is planning two days of events, including a round table discussion on civil disobedience and an open mic night. Roger Rowley is Moscow Contemporary's executive director. He's thinking of this as just the start of a creative movement. It's right there in the name, he says. You can think of the fall in Fall of Freedom as a decline or as part of a cycle, a season. ROGER ROWLEY: This is the fall of freedom, and there's quite likely a winter of freedom that we're going to have to continue to struggle through. But we'll get to a spring of freedom and a summer of freedom on the other side. You put in the energy now and you reap the rewards later.

test dummy design that advocates believe will help make cars safer for women. The Department of Transportation will consider using the dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five star-ratings once a final rule is adopted, the agency said in a news release. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men. The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man. The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women. The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said. Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags. Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements but developments have been slow. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement. \"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said. Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor. \"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said. The department said the new specifications will be available for manufacturers to build models and for the automotive industry to begin testing them in vehicles. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615174","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:48:00Z","title":"South Africa hosts G20 as tensions with U.S. flare amid boycott","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa is marred by a U.S. boycott under President Donald Trump, who accuses the country of race-based land confiscation and violence against white Afrikaners, rejecting the summit's DEI and sustainability agenda.

tensions with U.S. flare amid boycott \n         By Kate Bartlett \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 1:48 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The world's   biggest economy will be conspicuously absent from a meeting of the globe's 20 richest nations this weekend, as the U.S. boycotts the G20 Leaders' Summit hosted by South Africa. The Trump administration is snubbing the event over false race-based claims and what it considers the summit's DEI – diversity, equity and inclusion -- agenda. Since returning to office Trump has accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners. \"You know we have a G20 meeting in South Africa, South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore, because what happened there is bad,\" Trump said earlier this month. The government here has repeatedly tried to correct the U.S. administration, to no avail. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ramaphosa has kept his cool and was taciturn this week, saying: \"Their absence is their loss.\" Still, it's a huge blow to South Africa on the global stage. President Javier Milei of Argentina announced he isn't coming in solidarity with Trump. The leader of the world's second biggest economy, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is also not attending – though not as a slight – he isn't travelling internationally much these days. Then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin who can't come as he'd face arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine. William Gumede, an associate professor at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, says the summit controversy is a sign of the times. \"It is symbolic of the fractured global moment that we are in… it's almost an alternative summit without China and without America,\" Gumede told NPR. The summit's themes of \"solidarity, equality, sustainability\" are anathema to the U.S. administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying South Africa is pushing a quote \"DEI and climate change\" agenda. However other countries whose leaders  are  attending, like Germany, have praised the theme. U.S. Spat deepens As foreign leaders like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer started to arrive in South Africa on Friday, the  U.S.-South Africa spat deepened after Ramaphosa said the U.S. had made an eleventh-hour request to send a delegation after all. \"We have received notice from the United States…about a change of mind about participating in one shape, form or another in the Summit,\" he said. \"We still need to engage with them fully on what their participation at the 11th hour means.\" However, the South African leader said \"the United States being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be there, so it is pleasing there is a change of approach.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back angrily. \"The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa, I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States and that language is not appreciated,\" she said. She said because the U.S. is taking over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa, the embassy's chargé d'affaires—seen as a junior official -- would be there for the symbolic hand over. However Ramaphosa's spokesman said on X, quote \"The president won't hand over to a chargé.\" One of the big questions is whether the end of the summit on Sunday will result in a joint declaration by the countries in attendance – which the  U.S. is unlikely to sign. Tensions at home Aside from the geopolitical wrangling over the event, there has been discontent surrounding the summit from many in South Africa. Johannesburg residents have complained the city is only getting a cleanup for foreign guests despite having had crumbling infrastructure and chronic electricity and water shortages for years. \"Oh they are fixing, the traffic lights are up…the grass has been cut, all for? G20... You're showing off for visitors but you have no regard for the people that live in that city,\" journalist Redi Tlhabi said in her popular podcast. Ahead of the summit, on Friday, thousands of women dressed in black marked a day of action against gender-based violence, staying home from work and peacefully protesting by laying flat in parks and at university campuses. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group organizing the event, Women for Change, say they wanted to call attention to the high rates of femicide and violence in South Africa as the G20 convenes. Then there's been the war of the billboards. Trump's reason for snubbing South Africa has put race relations here in the spotlight and Afrikaners have differed in their responses. One right-wing Afrikaans rights group, which agrees with Trump that whites are being persecuted, has put up large billboards welcoming G20 delegates to \"the most race-regulated country in the world\" – a reference to affirmative action laws. In response, a progressive Afrikaner association has mounted their own campaign, with billboards showing the country's beloved rugby team, the Springboks. In the photo, two smiling white Afrikaner players carry their Black captain Siya Kolisi on their shoulders. \"Terrible things are happening in South Africa,\" reads the tongue-in-cheek tagline on the billboard. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615169","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"Trump to Meet New York Mayor-Elect Mamdani in Oval Office Amid Political Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is set to meet Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House in the Oval Office on Friday, November 21, 2025, marking their first face-to-face encounter.

While previous incoming New York City mayors have met with sitting presidents,  Mamdani and Trump  have already clashed prior to this meeting. Trump has repeatedly sought to paint Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, as too radical and extreme for the city that the president long called home. In the president's announcement of the meeting on Truth Social, Trump called Mamdani a \"communist.\" It's a narrative that Mamdani has firmly pushed back on, vowing to carry out his agenda focused on lowering the cost of living. \"My team reached out to the White House to set up this meeting because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than eight and a half million people who call this city home,\" Mamdani told reporters on Thursday. \"I have many disagreements with the president, and I believe that we should be relentless and pursue all avenues and all meetings that could make our city affordable for every single New Yorker.\" Trump has been a vocal opponent of Mamdani since his  upset win  in June's Democratic primary, saying he would arrest Mamdani if he disrupted ICE operations in the city and threatening to pull the city's federal funding should he win in November. \"Look, we don't need a communist in this country, but if we have one, I'm going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation,\" Trump told reporters over the summer, shortly after Mamdani's primary win. Mamdani responded directly to Trump in his victory speech on election night. \"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,\" he said, adding, \"to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.\" Over the course of just months, Mamdani's candidacy for mayor turned from a long-shot bid to a national movement, sparking interest  far beyond New York  in his progressive ideas, including freezing rent in rent-stabilized units, making city buses free and opening city-run grocery stores; and skepticism about how the new mayor will find the money to pay for it all. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Just weeks after being elected the next mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani is meeting President Trump at the White House. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The 34-year-old democratic socialist quickly became a national figure after an upset primary win earlier this year. He's got a lot of fans, particularly among young voters and progressives. But he's also become a foe for many on the right, including President Trump. MARTÍNEZ: NPR political reporter Elena Moore will be covering that meeting. Elena, this is one of these meetings where I did not expect these two in the same room together. ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Yeah, I mean, it's actually a tradition for the incoming mayor-elect to sit down with the president. Also, New York is an important place. It's the biggest city in the country and President Trump's hometown. He's from Queens, the same borough that Zohran Mamdani represents in the State Assembly right now. But despite that connection, A, Trump has been a vocal critic of Mamdani. Ahead of election day, he went as far as to endorse Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York who was running against Mamdani. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, and they seem like political polar opposites. So I can kind of see why Trump would be riled up by the new mayor. MOORE: Well, yeah. Mamdani ran on the Democratic ticket, but he identifies as a democratic socialist. And he's made some ambitious campaign promises aimed at tackling the rising cost of living, like freezing the rent for rent-stabilized apartments and creating city-run grocery stores. But his ideas are also ones that conservatives have painted as radical and extreme, and Trump has really taken that up a notch. He's repeatedly called Mamdani a communist. He said he'd arrest him if he didn't cooperate with ICE raids as mayor and suggested that Mamdani isn't living in the country legally even though, A, he's a naturalized citizen. MARTÍNEZ: And what's been Mamdani's response to Trump? MOORE: He's largely stood his ground. I mean, Mamdani made a point even to address the president directly in his victory speech, looking into the camera and telling Trump to turn the volume up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZOHRAN MAMDANI: Hear me, President Trump, when I say this. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us. (CHEERING) MOORE: Part of what makes Mamdani so impactful right now is that he's built a large movement, one that a lot of longtime Democrats just don't have at the moment. In the lead-up to election day, I talked to voters around the country who said they've been feeling increasingly disappointed by the Democratic Party in recent years but see Mamdani as a welcome change. So he is popular. And that's why, you know, partly, Trump is paying attention. MARTÍNEZ: So what are they going to talk about? New York Knicks basketball? MOORE: (Laughter) I wish. I mean, speaking to reporters yesterday, Mamdani said that even though he disagrees with Trump a lot, he's willing to work with anyone who wants to make life more affordable for New Yorkers. And as a reminder, I mean, Trump vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won. So there are real stakes here. But this isn't just about the dollars. You know, this meeting is a reminder of the big shift that Mamdani has to make in these next few weeks as he takes on this job. He's got a background as an activist, but being mayor of New York City is a totally different role. So today, it may be a test for him, you know, on balancing the policy priorities that got him elected and maintaining the political diplomacy required as mayor. MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR political reporter Elena Moore. Thanks a lot. MOORE: Thank you.

It was part of a podcast episode and story we did on  how to support a grieving friend . We received dozens of emails on this question. Some people shared the exact messages they sent to their own good friends. Others who have experienced loss told us what  not  to say — and what they wished people said instead. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As many can attest, it can be tricky to offer condolences — you want to show your friend you love them, but you also know there isn't much you can say to heal your friend's pain. Here are some ideas about what to say to a grieving friend. These responses have been edited for length and clarity.  'May love rest gently in your broken heart'  Our 29-year-old son died unexpectedly in September. There really are no words to console us. Most comments that mention healing or finding peace, however well-intentioned, feel so unrealistic and oblivious to the depth of our loss. I hope we do find peace and some degree of healing eventually, but right now I need to sit with my grief. I've thought a lot more about what I say to those who are grieving. The (barely) best I've come up with so far is: \"May love rest gently in your broken heart.\"  —Betsy Hooper-Rosebrook  A simple way to break the ice  When my husband passed away unexpectedly five years ago, it was so hard for me to go to the grocery store or the post office. Everyone asked me, \"How are you doing?\" I felt like I needed to respond in a way that assured the other person I was OK when I was not. However, two friends would always say, \"It's so good to see you,\" and give me a hug. That took the pressure off of me. So now, with my grieving friends, I try to say that too.  —Cindy Jackelen \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tell your friend they are wonderful  On a card, I usually say something like, \"I know their life was better because you were in it.\" People have commented that they loved hearing that.  —Connie DeMillo 'Sorry for your loss' does not cut it  Of course it is exactly what you mean and is probably sincere, but it's stock language. Come up with an original, personal message that's your own. Ask yourself: What would you want someone to say to you if you were in that situation? Give that person the gift of five minutes' thought and empathy.  —Beth Howard  Mark death anniversaries on your calendar  I lost my wife of 42 years to cancer ten years ago. I always dread the approach of her death anniversary. But it's comforting to receive a text from someone who remembers that day as well. I have a friend who lost both her husband and her only child to cancer. I've marked those dates in my calendar and I send a simple text that says \"Sending love to you today.\" It helps relieve the burden of grief when it is acknowledged and shared.  —Thomas McCabe  Bring up their laugh  Say, \"I'll always remember their laugh.\" Every time I've said it to a grieving person, they perked up, smiled and were truly thankful.  —James Vandeputte Don't say nothing Having lost my son when he was 20, don't say nothing. Saying something doesn't remind a grieving friend of their loss. It's already on their mind 24/7.  —David Lavallee Sit with them quietly When my mother passed away in 1998, it was very difficult for me. Friends called and came by and said the typical condolences. I didn't want to hear any of it. I was sitting alone in my living room quietly when my then 14-year-old son reached out and held my hand. He sat with me and never said anything. After a while, he got up and went back to his room. In that moment, I found total comfort and understanding. I knew I would get through this sadness. I wondered how my son could know this was all I needed. Sometimes, just sitting with a person and saying nothing is everything.  —Sharon S. Barnes Validate their pain  Several years ago, I had to deal with the death of two brothers and both parents over a span of about five years. I talked to a friend who had some training in grief counseling, and we worked out together some words to help me grieve and understand. It goes like this: Your world has been shattered and is in a million pieces. It no longer makes sense. You can't see how you can live and breathe and move in this world. But, given time, you will be able to put it back together. It won't be the same world that you knew before, because there will always be a piece missing — forever. But you'll be able to live and move in this new world that you've put together. Eventually, this world will make sense and start to work for you. You're even allowed to go visit the place where the piece is missing and grieve. I've been able to pass these words on to others who have been in severe grief, even strangers, and it seems to help. Maybe you can pass this message on to others.  —Dan Corbett  Share the silliest memories  My mother-in-law died recently at the age of 94. Upon her death, I reminded my wife of 35 years of a humorous event that occurred when my mother-in-law was a mere 80 years old. We were walking behind her into her house and later, the same evening, I told my wife that her mom had a cute butt. When I reminded my wife of that, we both laughed and cried. — Wayne Mac  Thank you to everyone who wrote in with your words of support and love for grieving friends.  The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane.

The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement. Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar. Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.

Instead, it was a deportation trap Multicultural New Orleans awaits arrival of ‘Swamp Sweep’ immigration crackdown Judge tosses DOJ lawsuit challenging a New York law barring immigration agents from state courts The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration , private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection , into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars. This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports. The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels. The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border. And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.

While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University. Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety. “They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.” ‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’ A license plate reader stands along the side of a road, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, in Stockdale, Texas.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country. Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop. But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people. Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist. Image recognition analysis overlaid on drivers and vehicles on Texas roads. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped. Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer. “We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound. Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP. In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.

They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting. At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing. “The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages. Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials. The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared. In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route. Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.

He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.” After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP. The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment. The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: “I didn’t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.” ‘Patterns of life’ and license plates A license plate reader used by U.S. Border Patrol is hidden in a sand crash barrel along the state Highway 80, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Douglas, Ariz.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt. Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states. But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region. In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said. Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning. The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.

In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio. Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety. Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment. Also from AP’s investigation into the use of surveillance technology: U.S. tech firms to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state , playing a far greater role in enabling rights abuses than known before. Across five Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. government has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police . Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used. Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests. CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county. One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.

CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.

Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million. In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security. “If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said. In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment. Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.

One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns. In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino , for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.

Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego. In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters. Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.

off cigarettes? Anti-smoking advocates are sharply split \n         By Gabrielle Emanuel, Arundathi Nair  \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 10:05 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         To vape or not to vape? That is the question sparking a heated debate this week in Geneva where over 1,400 delegates have gathered to discuss the World Health Organization's tobacco control treaty and what they call \"the tobacco epidemic.\" For years, there have been  stories  warning about the dangers of vapes, also known as e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette products like heated tobacco and nicotine pouches. Many scientists and public health experts point out that the tobacco industry promotes and profits from these newer products and that many young non-smokers are using e-cigarettes and becoming addicted to nicotine. However, a number of doctors, scientists and public health experts argue that, while these products are dangerous, they may not be as dangerous as traditional cigarettes, which  kill up to half  of long-term users. As the lesser of two evils, their argument goes, e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people quit smoking. This matters because even though smoking rates have been dropping, 1.2 billion people worldwide continue to use tobacco. About 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries. Accusations of industry influence and scientific censorship are flying. WHO staked out its stance on the issue this month in a strongly worded  position paper ,  slamming the idea of using e-cigarettes as a tool in smoking cessation. And at the anti-tobacco gathering in Geneva, leaders are calling for tough new restrictions on products like vapes. Both sides agree that getting this question right now is key to addressing the tobacco epidemic. \"Mea culpa!\" Twenty years ago, Dr. Derek Yach was well regarded in the public health world. The South African physician played a leading role in drafting and launching WHO's landmark tobacco treaty. And the treaty has played a critical role in reducing tobacco use, which has dropped by a third largely due to strategies like health warnings, taxation and bans on advertising. But now? Yach acknowledges he's a pariah to many former colleagues. \"I'm excommunicated,\" he says. That's because of his stance on e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and the like. Yach has come to believe that the traditional approach to smoking cessation is insufficient. \"There was only one message allowed and still is today: The only way to get rid of smoking is to get everybody to quit,\" he says, arguing that this approach doesn't \"recognize the toughness that people go through with a complex addiction, which is driven by nicotine.\" In many other areas of medicine, the idea of \"harm reduction\" is well established. For example, public health programs provide sterile needles to drug users so they don't spread HIV and hepatitis. It reduces the harm, even if it doesn't solve the addiction. Yach sees e-cigarettes as a method of harm reduction. While products like e-cigarettes still have nicotine, it is not burned. Instead, a heating element converts a nicotine liquid into a vapor that is inhaled. \"It's in the process of burning that you create the cancer-causing agents and many of the other toxins that eventually cause the death and disease,\" he says. Yach wants to see these products promoted by doctors and health programs as a way to help current smokers cut back on smoking or quit altogether. He remembers thinking to himself: \"Mea culpa! I've missed what is probably the greatest opportunity to save lives.\" Yach eventually founded the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, to advocate for this approach. It's since been renamed Global Action to End Smoking and is under new leadership. There's an important point to note about this group. When Yach was at the helm, the tobacco industry funded it. It is no long accepting additional funds from Philip Morris International but that connection cemented his self-described excommunication. But Yach is not a lone voice.  The U.K .'s National Health Service, for example, has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to help people stop smoking. And a number of academics — independent of the tobacco industry — have come to agree with him. Mike Cummings, a professor and researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of them. Cummings does not want non-smokers to use e-cigarettes or the other products — but he also stresses that \"for somebody who is already addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, having an alternative that would be safer, like an e-cigarette, is something that's worth considering.\" Because of his call for a debate, Cummings says, he's been shunned by many in the world of tobacco control. He says the fact that he's testified against tobacco companies in court more than 200 times hasn't saved him from being on the outs. \"One of the ways they have attacked us is to claim that we're shills for the cigarette companies, which is absurd. We're not,\" Cummings says. \"Many of us are legitimate scientists.\" He says an open debate hasn't happened yet — and that it can be hard to get funding for research into smoking harm reduction strategies. \"That's not science. That's anti-science. It's censorship,\" he says. One of the largest tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International, declined an interview request from NPR but said in a statement that WHO shouldn't fear dialogue and is out of step with governments that are embracing smoke-free products in order to end smoking. \"Mass marketing harmful products\" When it comes to the idea of harm reduction, WHO is adamant in its opposition. Its  position paper  says the tobacco industry is \"misappropriating\" the medical term harm reduction and \"mass marketing harmful products\" while \"cloaking\" it in medical language. \"Let's be clear, the companies that make these products are not motivated by harm reduction or health, they are motivated by one thing and one thing only: generating profit,\" says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"There is no evidence of their net benefit for public health, but mounting evidence of their harm.\" One major concern in this debate is that the products are often used by non-smokers — especially young ones who are attracted by the flavors and packaging. \"We see use rates [of e-cigarettes] among children nine times higher than among adults,\" says Benn McGrady. He heads Public Health Law and Policies at WHO, which helps governments develop and defend tobacco laws. \"The latest data that we have shows there are 15 million children worldwide using e-cigarettes.\" McGrady worries that, without proper regulations, there could be a generation of people newly addicted to nicotine. WHO argues that countries need to regulate the products at least as strictly as cigarettes. Last month, the International Pediatric Association also came out forcefully against e-cigarettes, warning in the medical journal  Pediatrics  that  \"e-cigarette use is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, oral diseases and cancer, with dual users facing greater health risks than cigarette smokers alone.\" The stakes, their position paper says, are high: \"E-cigarettes threaten to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control.\"   \"That's the opposite of harm reduction, right? That's really harm-causing,\" says  Stella Bialous , the associate director for Global Tobacco Control Initiatives at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. One concern that's surfaced has been  exposure to metals  — like lead — in the heating element of the e-cigarette. However,  studies  have pointed in both  directions . When it comes to exactly how risky these new products are, McGrady says, there's huge variation between the various products and it's \"not responsible\" to generalize. These products are relatively new and WHO's report acknowledges their risks will only become clear over time. \"An unutterable scam\" For some, this debate feels like déjà vu — and a classic example of the tobacco industry interfering in public health efforts and sowing division. Bialous says many researchers believe that this debate is \"actually one of the strategies that a tobacco company developed to divide and conquer — like 'let's talk about harm reduction and get all the people fighting among themselves while we continue to sell the products.'\" Dr. Tim McAfee is the former head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health — which has now been eliminated by President Trump. He says this current battle reminds him of when the industry promoted filtered cigarettes as safer in the 1950s and when they pushed low-tar cigarettes in the '60s and '70s. \"Every single one of those things they've done over the last 100 years has turned out to be an unutterable scam,\" he says. He calls the effort to promote e-cigarettes and similar products a smokescreen.   Cummings, the professor at Medical University of South Carolina, counters that just because these newer products are backed by the tobacco industry doesn't automatically mean they can't play a role in smoking reduction. \"We ought to get the evidence and weigh it and debate it — and help guide the policies based on evidence, not on ideology,\" he adds. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612582","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"Wicked: For Good is in theaters, along with 'Zodiac Killer Project' and more","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights multiple films premiering in theaters in late 2025, including 'Wicked: For Good', a musical film reimagining the story of the witches Elphaba and Glinda with new songs and themes of political oppression; a Brendan Fraser-led dramedy exploring emotional manipulation through a 'rental family' role-playing scenario; 'Cactus Pears (Sabar Bonda)', a Marathi-language film about a gay man navigating family expectations after his father's death; and 'The Zodiac Killer Project', a documentary that satirizes the genre of true crime films by reflecting on the storytelling tropes and ethical issues involved in such documentaries.

If you grew tired of waiting, there are more options: a Brendan Fraser-led dramedy, a stirring Marathi-language love story and a documentary  about  a documentary. Wicked: For Good  In theaters Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The yellow brick road is under construction as we rejoin our favorite green and pink Ozian witches. Elphaba, exiled after defying both gravity and the fraud who calls himself a Wizard, is creating as much havoc as she can with just a broom. Glinda, meanwhile, is spreading Wizardly propaganda and \"obsessulating\" over the motorized pink bubble she's been given to make her appear magical. They both have issues with the blowhard Wizard, who is pushing fake news, and is also, let's say, dictatorious, or maybe, fascistified. Things are darker in Oz this time. If you've somehow missed the backstory to this backstory,  Wicked  — first a novel, then a Broadway musical — was conceived as a prequel for adults to the events depicted in  The Wizard of Oz. It was nothing if not complicated, both morally and plot-wise — origin stories for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow were mostly brushed in after the central witch frenemies were well established. But that meant filmmaker Jon M. Chu had a problem when the Broadway hit became  two  movies. The story's early part about growing up has songs that are popular, gravity-defying. The later part, though, is about wising up — about consequences, the politics of oppression. It kinda doesn't sing. So for this movie, Stephen Schwartz wrote a new tune for Ariana Grande about Glinda's life in a bubble — and for Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba, he penned a musical nod to the original Wizard of Oz called \"No Place Like Home.\" And they're fine — fabulously sung, even if they seem just as aimed at original-song Oscar nominations as at filling plot holes. They just can't make this prequel-sequel feel any less dutiful or by the numbers — rehashing bits of the 1939 movie classic, shoehorning in animals who no longer talk, when all you really want is that song that gives  Wicked: For Good  its title. After way too long, the song arrives — powerhouse voices singing about friendship and doing good when good is hard. And for fans, that might make the long, five-hour,  two -movie trek feel worth it. Not for me. I was hoping for at least entrancillating. Rental Family In theaters Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       In director Hikari's sentimental dramedy, Brendan Fraser plays Phillip, an American actor in Tokyo who lands an unusual gig with a Japanese \"rental family\" agency — playing stand-in roles in the lives of strangers. His disorienting first assignment is \"sad white guy\" at a funeral, where he's startled to see the \"corpse\" sit up in his coffin to watch himself being mourned. Phillip's better prepared when he's hired to play the groom in a sham marriage that will free a young woman from her restrictive family. After initial trepidation, he celebrates the success of the ruse by spending the night with a sex worker (presumably for the benefit of audience members unaware that transactional relationships are time-honored). In longer-term engagements — playing an inquisitive journalist so a movie star with dementia will feel he's still remembered, and playing dad to a vulnerable 11-year-old girl — he gets emotionally involved with the folks he's deceiving, and they with him. Phillip's eyes well with tears as the manipulative nature of his relationships become problematic, but the filmmaker isn't nearly as interested in exploring the ramifications as he is in manipulating us. Cactus Pears (Sabar Bonda) In limited theaters starting Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Anand is a 30-something gay city dweller who's been caring for his dying father in Delhi, and who dreads traveling with his mother to their ancestral home in the countryside for ten days of ritual mourning. But once there, Anand reconnects with a childhood friend, also gay, and the two bond over their shared difficulties with families who want to know why they've not taken brides and settled down. Loosely based on filmmaker Rohan Parashuram Kanawade's own experience when his father died, the Marathi-language film offers a laconic but decently stirring portrait of men who struggle with lower-caste social restraints and familial obligations, and who ultimately find solace in each other. Zodiac Killer Project In limited theaters starting Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       With financing and contract negotiations underway, Charlie Shackleton was already scouting locations and storyboarding a documentary when he learned he was being denied the rights to retired California patrolman Lyndon Lafferty's book  The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up . Having gone that far, he couldn't bear to let it go, so he made a film about the film he  would have made , and ends up sending up the whole true crime documentary genre in the process. Wry, precise, earnest, bemused, the filmmaker is forthright about the evocative but manipulative clichés he's employing — cigarette butt-filled ashtrays, reenactments filmed in soft focus from behind, the swinging interrogation light (\"why is it always swinging\"). He also points out the shortcuts he's taking (\"this is actually a library, not a police station\"). The resulting film is amusing, pointed, and gets to the very heart of what makes these documentaries so compelling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97678","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:33:00-05:00","title":"Are there lessons for the U.S. in this European country's struggle with measles?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Romania, an upper-middle-income European nation, experienced a severe measles resurgence despite being part of the European Union, with 30,692 cases and 23 deaths in 2024.

lessons for the U.S. in this European country's struggle with measles? \n         By Michal Ruprecht \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 7:33 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         As the U.S. continues to face its  worst  measles outbreak in three decades, another country that has struggled with measles offers a telling case study: the eastern European nation of Romania. While most countries hardest hit by measles are lower-income countries in the Global South, wealthier countries have also seen significant outbreaks. Romania is one of them. The country ranked  fifth  on the measles outbreak list last year, reporting 30,692 cases and  23 deaths . According to Dr. Aurora Stanescu, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Public Health in Romania, five of those deaths were children under age 1. Nina Schwalbe, a senior scholar at the Georgetown Center for Health Policy and Politics, calls those figures a \"wake-up call.\" \"That's a lot of cases of measles, and that's a lot of deaths from a disease that really shouldn't be killing anybody at this point,\" Schwalbe says. Unlike many lower-resource countries where measles  takes a toll  — such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen — Romania is an upper-middle-income country and part of the European Union. Even now, the consequences of low vaccine rates linger. The country  continues  to report measles cases in 2025. However, initial tallies are significantly lower than those of last year. According to public health specialists in Romania, the current numbers reflect how measles  tends  to come in waves. Amid a  growing trend  of vaccine hesitancy around the world, Romania's experience paints a cautionary tale. An authoritarian past \"The outbreaks aren't only a matter of poverty and not understanding the importance of immunization,\" says Dr. Mihai Craiu, a pediatrician at Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania. \"It's multifactorial.\" One of the forces driving the measles surge is Romania's political transition. Under the repressive Communist government that  ruled  for more than four decades, vaccines for childhood diseases were required. Immunizations were  given  to kids at school without parental consent, Craiu says. \"Virtually all children were immunized,\" he recalls. \"Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination were ideal terrains in which the Communist state could demonstrate its power and legitimate its authority,\" historian Dora Vargha  wrote  in a book about vaccines. \"If vaccination worked, the result would be immediate and visible.\" The measles vaccine was  introduced  in 1979. The result: a 90% reduction in cases,  according  to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And an immunization rate above 95%. That's the magic number for measles. \"If 95% of people are vaccinated, the measles virus can't find a home for itself in those people, and eventually it gives up,\" Schwalbe says. Then came political — and vaccine — upheaval. When Romania  adopted  a democratic form of government in 1989, citizens gained more freedom — including the ability to decline the recommended but no longer mandatory vaccine.   Like others in post-Communist countries, Romanians  grew  more distrustful of their government — and the immunizations it was recommending. This laid the foundation for anti-vaccine groups to step in and take advantage of the public mindset. \"Part of the perception of democracy in Romania was the liberty of not obeying the rules,\" Craiu says, noting that some Romanians view immunization as a form of Communist-era state control. When Romanians refuse vaccines, he says it's their way of asserting independence after decades of authoritarian leadership. The impact of an HPV vaccine campaign But vaccine refusal wasn't just about asserting personal freedom. People began doubting the benefits of vaccines. \"This decline [in vaccination] is partly due to decreased public confidence in vaccination benefits, reflected in parental refusal to vaccinate their children,\"  read  a report published in October by Romania's National Institute for Public Health — their equivalent of the CDC. This trend was exacerbated by growing skepticism about vaccines, exacerbated by the  2008 campaign  to vaccinate girls against HPV, the virus that can  cause  cervical cancer. That campaign deepened public skepticism about all vaccines, as  headlines  from various Romanian media outlets demonstrate. At the time of the HPV vaccine rollout, measles vaccine coverage stood at the recommended 95% rate. In subsequent years, it declined steadily,  dropping  by 20 percentage points by 2017 and further declining to just 62% in 2023. A study conducted by Stanescu and her colleagues last year  found  that only one of Romania's more than 40 regions had measles vaccine coverage above 95%. The pandemic exacerbated that sharp nosedive in vaccine coverage, the National Institute for Public Health report observes, noting disruptions in routine vaccination. As the share of those protected against measles decreased,  outbreaks  pummeled the country. \"Some saw the outbreaks in the 2010s as a wake-up call, but others didn't,\" says Dr. Gindrovel Dumitra, the vice president of the Romanian National Society of Family Medicine. \"Some people simply refuse vaccines — and even an outbreak won't convince them.\" A health system struggles to keep up Along with Romania's growing anti-vaccine movement, the country faces systemic barriers that contribute to its low vaccination rates. Dumitra points to three main factors: a  fragile health system  that remains one of the most  underfunded  in Europe, a  shrinking  number of primary care providers — driven by burnout and low compensation —   and the  absence  of mandatory immunization policies. Lack of funding for health care  disproportionately affects  minority groups like the country's  nearly  2 million Roma people. Minorities are often blamed for low vaccination rates, but Craiu says a deeper look reveals that the problem stems from inadequate outreach and lack of access to care. \"If you don't have a family doctor in your village, then first of all, it's difficult to get information and then it's also difficult to access vaccines,\" says Dr. Silvia Gatscher, the health operations manager at the World Health Organization Country Office in Romania. As the years passed, the clergy  became   influential  in  advocating  against vaccines — some say as a reaction to the government  limiting  church services during the early years of the pandemic. Simultaneously, far-right politicians  capitalized  on growing mistrust toward vaccines. One of those anti-vaccine lawmakers is Diana Sosoaca. She said, \"God is not vaccinated\" during a  brief speech  on the floor of the European Parliament last year. A free fall in immunization coverage Currently, only two-thirds of Romanians are fully vaccinated against measles. That's the  lowest  measles vaccination rate in the European Union. The shortfall has serious consequences. Researchers  estimate  that one person who contracts the virus can infect up to 18 unvaccinated people nearby. The risk is especially dire for children too young to have completed the two-dose vaccination protocol, which is  administered  first at 12 months and then again at age 5. That includes babies like Ionela Radulescu's son. Last year, the 7-month-old was hospitalized for pneumonia and came into contact with a child infected with measles. \"He had a rash on his face. It was pinkish and very small,\" the 31-year-old mother says through an interpreter. \"Then it started going down onto his chest and palms. It even went down to the soles of his feet. He had it everywhere.\" Radulescu lives in Suceava, in northern Romania. Last year, the area  recorded  the sixth-highest rate of measles cases among more than 40 regions. The frequency of cases in Suceava  mirrored  levels seen in countries before the measles vaccine became widely available. Although her son was too young to be vaccinated, the mother says: \"I felt bad. It was very hard. I started questioning myself and asking questions like, Was I too negligent? Was I not careful enough? You start to blame yourself. It's a really ugly feeling.\" And measles can be far more than an uncomfortable rash. The virus can  lead to  pneumonia, eye inflammation, diarrhea and ear infections, which can result in deafness in approximately 5 to 10% of cases. Even after recovering from the illness, children remain at risk for a rare and fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It typically  appears  about seven to 10 years after the initial infection. Stanescu estimates there have been about a dozen cases in Romania in recent years. \"Just because you're OK from that infection at the time doesn't mean that that infection doesn't have very serious consequences for you later in life,\" Schwalbe explains. A different way to talk to parents While Craiu and Dumitra admit it's an uphill battle, they've taken an evidence-based approach to combating misinformation and encouraging vaccination. \"It's a huge difference in what we learned in medical school and what I'm doing now,\" Craiu explains. When speaking with parents, Dumitra  uses motivational interviewing , a technique that helps patients adopt changes when they decide the change matters to them — not because a doctor said so. It also encourages physicians to listen without judgment, exploring a patient's ambivalence. The  American Academy of Pediatrics praises the method  as an effective way to improve communication about vaccines. \"Yesterday, when I recommended a woman to be vaccinated against the flu, she told me, 'I'm scared of the vaccine.' I asked her, 'Why?'\" Dumitra recalls. The woman explained she was worried the vaccine would worsen a chronic illness. \"After acknowledging her concerns, I offered her information and then verified if she understood it. She eventually got vaccinated.\" Lessons from Romania's outbreaks Gatscher is optimistic that evidence-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy will chip away at the mistrust and misinformation surrounding vaccines in her country. Yet the global measles count this year indicates that other relatively well-off countries aren't drawing any lessons from Romania. This month, Canada  lost  its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission,  with  5,000 cases so far this year. The U.S. has confirmed  1,723 cases  in 2025 so far, according to the CDC — the highest annual number  in more than three decades . While the U.S. has much to learn from what has happened in Romania, Schwalbe says America exists in its \"own bubble\" and often looks away from examples like Romania. \"I think we are incredibly good in America at thinking, 'That's what's happening over there, and it has nothing to do with us,'\" Schwalbe says. \"I don't think that Romania will teach us any lessons, unfortunately, even though it's such a clear lesson. The lesson to everybody — all over the world — is that when you lose high coverage of [vaccination against] measles, the disease comes back.\" Michal Ruprecht is a Stanford Global Health Media Fellow. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/takiya-young-connor-grubb-officer-shooting-shoplifting-ab9b30a450f7cc2ed051f15c73305a34","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:03:33+00:00","title":"Ohio Police Officer Acquitted in Shooting Death of Pregnant Black Woman Accused of Shoplifting","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Columbus, Ohio, police officer Connor Grubb was acquitted of all charges, including murder, after shooting and killing 21-year-old pregnant Black mother Ta’Kiya Young, who had been accused of shoplifting at a Kroger store.

Blendon Township police officer Connor Grubb had faced up to life in prison if convicted. Young’s grandmother collapsed into sobs at the decision, shouting “It’s not right! This is not right!” The judge then told Grubb he was free to go. Sean Walton, an attorney for the Young family, called it “an American tragedy,” the outcome of a dual system of justice in the U.S. He vowed to keep pursuing a lawsuit against the township and police chief, while Ta’Kiya’s grandmother Nadine Young raises her great-grandsons, now 8 and 5. “It’s also heartbreaking because what it does is it normalizes the behavior like that Connor Grubb exhibited that day, and that is not normal,” Walton said. “If you look at these recent police killings in Columbus, you have officers who have an irrational fear with no weapons involved or folks doing very minimal behavior that they escalate into a murder.” Defense attorney Mark Collins said Grubb and his family are relieved, but that it’s wrong to suggest the officer was untouched by the death of Young and her unborn daughter.

He said legislators should fix Ohio’s grand jury system. Grubb had pleaded not guilty to murder, involuntary manslaughter and felonious assault in the death of Young, 21, on Aug. 24, 2023. Bodycam recordings showed Young refusing to exit her parked car outside a Kroger in suburban Columbus, and then turning her steering wheel to the right before the vehicle began slowly rolling forward toward Grubb, who fired one shot into her chest through the windshield. Franklin County Common Pleas Judge David Young, no relation to Ta’Kiya, dropped four of 10 counts relating to the death of Young’s baby, agreeing with defense attorneys that prosecutors failed to present proof that Grubb knew Young was seven months’ pregnant when he shot her. Jurors were shown the bodycam video and heard testimony from a use-of-force expert, an accident reconstructionist, a police policy expert and Sgt. Erick Moynihan, the officer who with Grubb had ordered Young out of her car. They never heard from Grubb, whose side of the story was contained in a written statement read into the record by a special agent for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. He attended the trial, but prosecutors were unable to question him directly. Grubb and Moynihan had approached Young’s parked car about a report that she was suspected of stealing alcohol from a Kroger store in the Columbus suburb. She partially lowered her window and protested as both officers cursed at her and yelled at her to get out. Bodycam video showed Grubb had his left hand on the car’s hood while pointing his gun at her with his right. Young could be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?” Then, she put on a turn signal and her car rolled slowly forward toward Grubb, who fired a single bullet into her chest, the recording showed. In the statement, Grubb said he positioned himself in front of Young’s vehicle to provide backup and to protect other people. He said he drew his gun after he heard Young fail to comply with Moynihan’s commands. When her car moved toward him, he said, he felt the vehicle hit his legs and shins and begin to lift his body off the ground as he shot. Moments later, after the car came to a stop against the building, they broke the driver’s side window. Police said they tried to save her life, but she was mortally wounded. Young and her child were pronounced dead at a hospital."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/treasury-immigration-tax-credits-trump-58d614b31f6f8322629df715bd38d380","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"00:37:17+00:00","title":"U.S. Treasury to Restrict Tax Benefits for Immigrant Taxpayers, Targeting DACA and TPS Recipients","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Treasury Department plans to reclassify several refundable tax credits—such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, Additional Child Tax Credit, and American Opportunity Tax Credit—as 'federal public benefits' under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.

2025-11-21T00:37:17+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday it plans to reclassify certain refundable tax credits as “federal public benefits,” which will bar some immigrant taxpayers from receiving them, even if they file and pay taxes and would otherwise qualify. Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say. The Treasury Department’s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a “ whole of government ” approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government — not just Homeland Security — to come up with ways to help carry out the president’s hardline immigration agenda. The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022. For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance , even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits. Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump’s broader policies. “It’s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,” said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute. “Implementing this will require determining who has status and who doesn’t, which is another way that the Trump administration will expand its deportation dragnet.” The final regulation is expected to apply beginning in tax year 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that “we are enforcing the law and preventing illegal aliens from claiming tax benefits intended for American citizens.” Treasury sought a Justice Department reinterpretation of the law in order to craft the new rule, the agency said. Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said since people without work authorization already don’t qualify for these refundable tax credits, “the folks who are really going to be impacted are people who are really trying to do the right thing, the people authorized to work and paying their taxes.” He said he believed the administration was trying to make the lives of taxpaying immigrants more difficult. NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.” “Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said. Davis said there probably wouldn’t be majority support for the move in Congress, which he said probably prompted the administration to act unilaterally on the issue instead. “The American people are broadly sympathetic to the Dreamers and DACA recipients. Targeting them in this roundabout way, that’s not a policy change that would’ve had majority support in Congress,” he said. ___ Salomon contributed from Miami."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-traitors-sedition-illegal-orders-c5fc3c5bd2fbc6b1204550e4203c24b2","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:38:08+00:00","title":"Trump Accuses Democratic Lawmakers of Sedition Over Military Video Urging Resistance to 'Illegal Orders'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A video released by six Democratic lawmakers — including Sen.

Elissa Slotkin’s X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.” “The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution,” Slotkin wrote in the X post. Along with the Michigan senator, the other lawmakers appearing in the video are seen as possible future aspirants for higher office, who now, thanks to the video’s wide exposure, have elevated their own political profiles. Trump on Thursday reposted messages from others about the video, amplifying it with his own words. It marked another flashpoint in the political rhetoric that at times has been thematic in his administrations, as well as among some in his MAGA base. Some Democrats accused him of acting like a king and trying to distract from the soon-to-be-released files about disgraced financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein. What Democrats said in the video With pieces of dialogue spliced together from different members, the lawmakers introduce themselves and their background. They go on to say the Trump administration “is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens.” They call for service members to “refuse illegal orders” and “stand up for our laws.” The lawmakers conclude the video by encouraging service members, “Don’t give up the ship,” a War of 1812-era phrase attributed to a U.S. Navy captain’s dying command to his crew. Although the lawmakers didn’t mention specific circumstances in the video, its release comes as the Trump administration continues attempts at deployment of National Guard troops into U.S. cities for various roles, although some have been pulled back, and others held up in court. Are U.S. troops allowed to disobey orders? Troops, especially uniformed commanders, have a specific obligation to reject an order that’s unlawful, if they make that determination. However, while commanders have military lawyers on their staffs to consult with in helping make such a determination, rank-and-file troops who are tasked with carrying out those orders are rarely in a similar position. Broad legal precedence holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, doesn’t absolve troops. However, the U.S. military legal code, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice or UCMJ, will punish troops for failing to follow an order should it turn out to be lawful. Troops can be criminally charged with Article 90 of the UCMJ, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, and Article 92, failure to obey an order.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More How Trump and others responded On Thursday, Trump reposted to social media an article about the video, adding his own commentary that it was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country.” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” Trump went on. “LOCK THEM UP???” He called for the lawmakers’ arrest and trial, adding in a separate post that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” Trump also reposted more than a dozen comments from other accounts criticizing Democrats, including one that stated: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!” Asked during a White House briefing on Thursday about the intent of Trump’s messages, press secretary Karoline Leavitt instead honed in on the Democrats’ message, which she posited “perhaps is punishable by law.” Leavitt went on to say that any incitement to “defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders” is “a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do, and they should be held accountable, and that’s what the president wants to see.” The White House insisted Thursday that President Donald Trump was not calling for Democratic lawmakers to be executed for a video urging troops to defy “illegal orders,” despite his post calling their comments “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” Democrats were swift to react to Trump’s words, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warning in a floor speech that the president was “lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.” Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence in the social media posts, saying Trump was merely “defining a crime,” and calling the Democrats’ video “wildly inappropriate.” “Think of the threat that is to our national security and what it means for our institution,” Johnson added. Trump’s allies balked at the video. On Wednesday on Fox News, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called the messaging “insurrection — plainly, directly, without question” and said it represented “a general call for rebellion from the CIA and the armed services of the United States, by Democrat lawmakers.” On X, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth commented on the video Tuesday as “Stage 4 TDS,” referring to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a term used by Trump to describe voters so angry and opposed to him that they are incapable of seeing any good in what he does. The Steady State, which describes itself as “a network of 300+ national and homeland security experts standing for strong and principled policy, rule of law, and democracy,” wrote in a Substack post on Thursday that the lawmakers’ call was “only a restatement of what every officer and enlisted servicemember already knows: illegal orders can and should be refused. This is not a political opinion. It is doctrine.” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell challenged the theory that illegal orders were being issued. “Our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders,” Parnell told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We love the Constitution. These politicians are out of their minds.” ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Stephen Groves and Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1238037879","dateOfPublication":"2024-03-14","timeOfPublication":"09:53:00-04:00","title":"Parent-approved tips on traveling with kids under 2","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article, written by Beck Harlan and published by Life Kit (part of NPR), compiles over 200 real parent responses to travel tips for babies and toddlers under age 2.

     \n        \n      \n\n         Last month, Life Kit asked parents to share their go-to advice for traveling with babies and toddlers under age 2 as part of  an episode  we did on the subject. Over 200 folks responded with tips they wish they'd known before taking a big trip with a little one. Reading through these responses, it became clear there's no magic hack that works for every kid. Some parents swore by sticking to their kid's sleep schedule on a trip, others said their vacation was smoother when they let the usual routine go. Some sang the praises of the overnight flight (so their child would sleep on the plane), others said their child has never slept more than 10 minutes on a plane no matter the timing.  \n       \n      Related Story:  I flew to Japan with my baby. Here's the travel advice that helped me survive the trip \n       A few pieces of advice held true throughout. A hungry kid is an unpleasant kid, and children are messy. So packing lots of snacks, extra diapers and a change of clothes ranked high on the list of must-dos. Almost 40 of over 200 responses suggested packing extra outfits in your carry-on for your kid and for you. (If your charge spits up, throws up, blows out or spills it will also get on you!)  So here's a non-exhaustive, impossible-to-be-comprehensive, but-hopefully-still-helpful round-up of your top advice for traveling with little kids. These responses have been edited for length and clarity.  What to pack  A stroller that can be stored in the overhead bin.  It's a game changer to not have to check clunky strollers at the gate or check-in counters.  —Amy P. A change of clothes for yourself.  If the baby spits up or has a blowout, there's a high likelihood that the mess will end up on you too, especially if you're holding them. Also, be sure to bring a bag to put messy clothes in. Reusable waterproof bags are great and they keep the smell in!  —Jenna Yount  Extra diapers.  You think you will be fine but if something comes up it's not a good situation to be in.  —Jeanna Limtiaco Overnight diapers.  Fewer diaper changes in transit makes everyone happier.  —Samantha Warren  Snacks.  Remember, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration allows for any size baby food [and baby or toddler beverage], so pack those pouches!  —Clara W.  Meds you and your kids might need in flight.  That includes chewable Tylenol, Imodium, Dramamine, Zofran, ginger chews, Band-Aids and alcohol wipes.  —Paige Ellis A dark-colored bath towel.  It's a blanket, it's for tidying up, it's a tablecloth, it's a sun cover, it shields bottoms from hot slides, it dries off swings. It's a multi-tasking powerhouse.   —Judith Heise  Consider what may make sense to buy, rent or borrow upon arrival.  You don't need to stuff everything into your suitcase. Buy some of your diapers and snacks at your destination. See if you can borrow or rent large, bulky items like car seats or travel cribs from Facebook Marketplace or your hotel or Airbnb.   —Jocelyn Newman  How to get through the flight Get to your gate an hour before boarding.  It gives you time to feed your child, change their diapers, have a cup of coffee and fill your water bottle. It can also help your kid let out their energy before they have to sit on the plane.  —Shelly C. Check the airport for family friendly spaces.  Use nursing spaces or pods and family restrooms to reset as needed. Check lounges for nursing and play rooms.  —Sara Conger  Take an early morning flight.  Those are least likely to get delayed, which is important when traveling with kids.  —Carina Ochoa \n       \n      Related Story:  Parenthood Is A Shock To The System. These Tips Can Help You With The Transition \n       Board with your partner separately.  If you're traveling with two caregivers, have one go on the plane first with all the stuff and do the gate-checking of the stroller while the other hangs back with the kids until the last minute. It gives kids more time to run around!  —Andrea De Francesca Get a plane seat for your kid.  Even though many airlines allow kids under 2 to fly for free as a lap baby, if you can afford to get them their own seat, it is worth it. It is recommended for safety to have them in a car seat, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and the extra space for them to move around is nice.  —Nicole Shelledy Be ready for motion sickness.  We were not prepared for how easily some little ones get motion sickness on an airplane. Have throw-up bags handy at all times.  —Tiff Bankhurst Prevent ear discomfort.  Sucking during take off and landing may help relieve ear discomfort. My babies have flown with me from 4 weeks onward and never had a problem as long as they had a bottle or sippy cup or straw to suck on.  —Shelly Ransom  Don't plan on them sleeping on the plane.  It's great if they do, but if it doesn't happen, you'll be frustrated.  —Colleen Mayerhoff  Don't worry too much about your kid \"bothering\" other people.  The vast majority of people don't care, and many have been in the same situation you've been in and feel nothing but empathy for you. As for those who do care, they are not guaranteed a child-free existence in public. Kids are part of society too, and they are also allowed to take up space.  —Jenna Yount Make friends with the flight crew.  They're going to help, they've got more experience than you, and they also want the flight to be pleasant.  —April Graham Save the screens for the flight.  If you're using a screen, wait until you're on the plane. While you're waiting in the terminal, let them move as much as possible. Find an empty gate and play Simon Says, see who can jump in one place the longest, do animal charades. Let them go wild.  —Paige Ellis  Download age-appropriate shows for your child on an iPad.  (But know that if your kid is under age 2 they'll mostly just want to push the buttons.)  —Chantel Dockstader Travel hacks  Find a lodging close to a grocery store and a park.  It makes it easy to buy last-minute things and burn off their energy easily at a park.  —Gillian Molina Dress your young kids in bright, matching shirts.  I once traveled alone when my kids were 2, 4 and 6. We all wore matching yellow shirts so people could see we were together.  —Emily Hernandez  If you want to let your little one crawl around , bring a pair of socks that you can put over their hands. Then you don't have to worry about dirty hands afterward.  —Shannon Geraghty Hire a photographer.  You'll have photos with everyone in them, maybe get to see some scenic parts of the city you hadn't seen before. Dress up, wear matching outfits, be extra! They're only little once.  —Tina Doyle  Helpful mindsets It's not a vacation. It's a trip.  You're just parenting in a new place. Set your expectations accordingly.  —Laura Henriquez   The airport/train/bus/car is not the time to enforce the normal at-home rules.  Do you want Doritos at 7 a.m. at the airport? OK. Do you want to watch 20 episodes of Blippi on the plane? No problem. There are no rules when traveling. This also makes traveling fun for kids because they get to do something different.  —Meg Houston  Build in extra time to do things.

The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the Lakers didn’t publicly announce the firings of the two children of longtime Lakers owner Jerry Buss, who died in 2013. The Lakers are also overhauling the scouting staff that worked with the brothers. The Buss brothers confirmed their departure in a statement issued to ESPN, although both will retain their inherited minority ownership stakes under new controlling owner Mark Walter. Jesse Buss was an assistant general manager, while Joey Buss was the Lakers’ alternate governor and vice president of research and development. “We are extremely honored to have been part of this organization for the last 20 seasons,” Joey and Jesse Buss said in their statement. “Thank you to Laker Nation for embracing our family every step of the way. We wish things could be different with the way our time ended with the team. At times like this, we wish we could ask our Dad what he would think about it all.” Jerry Buss had at least seven children, and six of them worked for the Lakers at some point during his ownership.

Walter finalized his purchase of a controlling stake in the Lakers three weeks ago in a sale initially announced in June and conducted with a $10 billion franchise valuation. Jeanie Buss will remain the Lakers’ governor for the foreseeable future, but the Lakers are now primarily owned by Walter, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Joey and Jesse Buss have been involved in the Lakers’ scouting and player development operations for many years, and they’ve been praised for their roles in the Lakers’ successful drafts and free-agent signings.

The S&P 500 took off and rallied 1.5%, flirting with its best day since May, after bobbing up and down through the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 688 points, or 1.5%, as of 2:45 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.6% higher. The abrupt turn could provide a fitting capstone for a week that has the S&P 500 just 3.7% below its record but also forced investors to stomach the sharpest hour-to-hour swings since a sell-off in April . The jarring moves are testing investors following a monthslong and remarkably smooth surge for stocks, and they come down to two basic questions, neither of which has been answered yet. Have prices for Nvidia , bitcoin and other stars of Wall Street shot too high? And is the Federal Reserve done with its cuts to interest rates , which would boost the economy and prices for investments? On the second question, financial markets found some assurance from a speech by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Markets perked up immediately after John Williams told a conference in Chile that he sees “room for a further adjustment” for interest rates.

What the Fed does is critical for Wall Street because stock prices ran to records through last month in part because of expectations for a series of reductions. Other Fed officials, though, have argued against a December cut given how high inflation remains. The uncertainty created by such sharp disagreement has triggered dramatic moves back and forth for markets. The swings hit a crescendo on Thursday, when U.S. stocks initially surged after Nvidia seemed to tamp down worries about a potential bubble in artificial-intelligence technology. But the market quickly dropped to a sharp loss in its biggest one-day reversal since April , when President Donald Trump shocked markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs . Despite the strong profit report from Nvidia, whose chips are powering the move into AI, worries are still hanging around about the longer term. Will those AI chips that Amazon, Meta Platforms and other companies are gobbling up actually yield profits and productivity that are as big as proponents are envisioning? If not, some investors fear, all the investment won’t be worth it. AI-linked stocks continued to swing on Friday, helping to drag the rest of the market behind them. Nvidia went from an initial gain to a drop of 4.3% and back to a rise of 0.6%, for example. Amazon swung from an early loss to a gain of 1.8%. Bitcoin, meanwhile, briefly plunged below $81,000 before pulling back to $84,000. That’s down from nearly $125,000 last month and back to where it was in April, when markets were shaking because of Trump’s tariffs. The vast majority of stocks on Wall Street rose despite such swings, with more than 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 climbing. Their movements often get drowned out by Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks, whose movements have much more effect on the S&P 500 because of their immense sizes. “When the largest companies drive most of the losses, the market can look weaker than it really is,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Several retailers led the way. Gap jumped 9.2% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Richard Dickson said it saw strong sales trends at each of its Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic brands. Ross Stores rallied 8.5% after it likewise delivered a better profit than expected. CEO Jim Conroy said it saw broad-based growth during the quarter and raised the company’s forecast for an important measure of sales during the holiday season. Homebuilders were also strong on hopes that lower interest rates could make mortgages cheaper and give a kick to the housing market. D.R. Horton jumped 7.3%, PulteGroup gained 5.9% and Lennar rose 6.7%. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased on the hopes for cuts from the Fed. Traders are now betting on a nearly 70% probability of a December cut, up sharply from 39% a day before, according to data from CME Group. That helped send the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 4.06% from 4.10% late Thursday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after markets tumbled in Asia following Wall Street’s stunning reversal. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.4%, and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 3.8% for two of the larger losses. ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/new-female-crash-test-dummy-design-228864ac691793f70372b103e305dc1d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:57:31+00:00","title":"U.S. Announces Major Design Changes to Female Crash Test Dummy for Safer Roads","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Transportation, under Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, has announced a major redesign of the female crash test dummy to better reflect the anatomical differences between men and women, aiming to improve safety ratings for female drivers.

major design changes it wants to implement to make the female version of the vehicle crash test dummy more lifelike, potentially replacing a model used for decades that is based almost entirely around the body of a man despite higher injury risks for women. Department of Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government’s vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday night in a news release. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men. The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man. The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It’s routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver’s seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women. But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.

Follow on Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy’s support but said she won’t celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing — a step that has been delayed numerous times. “I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we’ve won,” Kuhn said Friday. “But we are far from crossing the finish line.” Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags. Despite Duffy’s announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said. “Certainly we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,” Young said. “But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we’re using are doing a good job.” Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow. U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement. “Any progress here is good because there’s simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,” Duckworth said. Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor. “It’s far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America’s roads safer for all drivers,” Fischer said. The department said the new specifications will be available for manufacturers to build models and for the automotive industry to begin testing them in vehicles."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-files-release-justice-department-32cbc21a6ae8189dccd00455dc83d2be","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"21:20:57+00:00","title":"U.S. to Release Epstein Files Amid Public and Political Pressure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress has passed and President Donald Trump has signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requiring the U.S. Justice Department to release all unclassified records related to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.

After months of rancor and recriminations, Congress has passed and President Donald Trump has signed legislation compelling the Justice Department to give the public everything it has on Epstein — and it has to be done before Christmas. But even that might not be enough for the curious and the conspiracy-minded. While there’s sure to be never-before-seen material in the thousands of pages likely to be released, a lot of Epstein-related records have already been made public, including by Congress and through litigation. And don’t expect a “client list” of famous men who cavorted with Epstein. Though such a list has long been rumored, the Justice Department said in July that it doesn’t exist. Here’s a look at what’s expected to be made public, what isn’t, and a refresher on how we got to this point: Related Stories Christian pastor’s daughter urges US lawmakers to help free her father in China 4 MIN READ Proposed peace plan for Ukraine leaves country in a delicate position between US and Russia 5 MIN READ Khashoggi’s widow and Democrats demand release of call transcript with Trump and Saudi crown prince 3 MIN READ Who is Jeffrey Epstein? Epstein was a millionaire money manager known for socializing with celebrities, politicians, billionaires and the academic elite who was accused of sexually abusing underage girls. His relationships with powerful men, including Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the former British prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, have been the subject of endless fascination and speculation. Neither Trump nor Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing. Andrew has denied abusing anyone. Police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein in 2005 after he was accused of paying a 14-year-old girl for sex. The FBI then joined the investigation, but Epstein made a secret deal with the U.S. attorney in Florida to avoid federal charges, enabling him to plead guilty in 2008 to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge. He served 13 months in a jail work-release program. In 2019, during Trump’s first term, Manhattan federal prosecutors revived the case and charged Epstein with sex trafficking, alleging he sexually abused dozens of girls. He killed himself in jail a month after his arrest. In 2021, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Epstein’s longtime confidante and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking for helping recruit some of his underage victims. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . What’s in the Justice Department’s Epstein files? Records related to the aborted Florida investigation, the Manhattan investigations, and anything else the Justice Department did to examine Epstein’s dealings in the time in between. They could include notes and reports written by FBI agents; transcripts of witness interviews, photographs, videos and other evidence; Epstein’s autopsy report; and some material that may already be public, such as flight logs and travel records. The law, dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, mandates the Justice Department to release all unclassified documents and investigative materials, including files relating to immunity deals and internal communications about whom to charge or investigate. What isn’t authorized for release under the law? Anything containing a victim’s personally identifiable information. The law allows the Justice Department to withhold or redact records that, if made public, would constitute “a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” It also bars the release of any materials depicting the sexual abuse of children, or images of death, physical abuse, or injury. That means that if videos or photos exist of Epstein or anyone else sexually abusing underage girls, they can’t be made public. However, the law also makes clear that no records shall be withheld or redacted — meaning certain parts are blacked out — solely because their release would cause embarrassment or reputational harm to any public figure, government official or foreign dignitary. When will the files be available to the public? The legislation requires the Justice Department to make the documents public in a searchable and downloadable format within 30 days of Trump signing it into law. That means no later than Dec. 19. However, the law also allows the Justice Department to withhold files that it says could jeopardize an active federal investigation. That’s also longstanding Justice Department policy. Files can also be withheld if they’re found to be classified or if they pertain to national defense or foreign policy. While investigations into Epstein and Maxwell are long over, Attorney General Pam Bondi last week ordered a top federal prosecutor to lead an investigation into people who knew Epstein and some of Trump’s political foes, including Clinton. That investigation, taken up at Trump’s urging despite the Justice Department previously finding no evidence to support such a probe, could give the government grounds to temporarily withhold at least some of the material. What about the so-called client list? Epstein’s so-called “client list” — a purported collection of his famous associates — has been the white whale of Epstein sleuths, skeptics and conspiracy theorists alike. Even Bondi got in on the act, telling Fox News in February that the “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now to review.” The only problem: the Justice Department concluded it doesn’t exist, issuing a letter in July saying that its review of Epstein-related records had revealed no incriminating “client list.” Nor was there credible evidence that Epstein had “blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” the unsigned memo said. Why are these records being released now? Congress is forcing the government to act after Trump reneged on a campaign promise last year to throw open the files. The Justice Department did release some records earlier this year — almost all of them already public — but suddenly hit the brakes in July after promising a “truckload” more. That prompted a small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers to launch what was initially seen as a longshot effort to compel their release through legislation. In the meantime, lawmakers started disclosing documents they’d received from Epstein’s estate, culminating in a 23,000-page release last week. As public and political pressure mounted, including from some Trump allies, Congress swiftly passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act on Tuesday and Trump signed it into law on Wednesday. Haven’t some Epstein files already been made public? Yes. Before Congress got involved, tens of thousands of pages of records were released over the years through civil lawsuits, Epstein and Maxwell’s public criminal case dockets, public disclosures and Freedom of Information Act requests. Many documents — including police reports written in Florida, state grand jury records, depositions of Epstein’s employees, his flight records, his address book — are available already. In July, the Justice Department released surveillance video from the jail on the night Epstein died. Even the FBI has previously released some Epstein-related files, posting more than 1,400 pages to its website, though much of the material was redacted and some hidden because it was under seal."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2111-11-21","timeOfPublication":"21:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global events: a significant drop in US funding to the Red Cross under Trump’s 'America First' agenda, a deadly earthquake near Dhaka with a gas leak as a likely cause, a crash involving the HAL Tejas jet, a US-brokered plan forcing Kyiv to concede to Russia and exit NATO, human rights concerns linked to Israeli military actions, a school kidnapping in Nigeria, and Brazil’s climate proposal lacking a fossil fuel transition plan.

(AP) — A man convicted of raping and fatal beating his manager at a Florida convenience store in 1988 was put to death Thursday evening in the state’s record 17th execution this year. Richard Barry Randolph , 63, was pronounced dead at 6:12 p.m. following a three-drug injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. Randolph was convicted of murder, armed robbery, sexual battery and grand theft and sentenced to death in 1989 for the killing of Minnie Ruth McCollum. The curtain to the death chamber went up exactly at 6:00 p.m., the scheduled execution time, and authorities began administering the drugs two minutes later after Randolph had no last words. As the drugs flowed, Randolph’s eyes were closed and his face twitched slightly. He breathed heavily for a few minutes before going still, the color drained from his face. A warden shook Randolph and yelled his name, but there was no reaction and no movement. A medic was called in at 6:11 p.m. and Randolph was subsequently pronounced dead. Jordan Kirkland, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said at a news briefing afterward that the family of the victim had asked him to thank Gov. Ron DeSantis on their behalf. Kirkland said earlier that three members of the victim’s family had planned to be witnesses but he didn’t elaborate.

Follow on According to court records, Randolph attempted in August 1988 to break into the safe at a convenience store in Palatka, where he had previously worked. Randolph was spotted by the manager, McCollum, and the two began to struggle. Randolph then beat, strangled, stabbed and raped McCollum before leaving the store and taking the woman’s car, the records show. Three women witnessed Randolph leaving the store and called the sheriff’s office after seeing through the window that the store was in disarray. A deputy responded and found McCollum still alive. Taken to a hospital in a coma, she died six days later of severe brain injuries, according to doctors. Randolph was arrested shortly afterward at a Jacksonville grocery store while trying to borrow money and also cash in lottery tickets stolen from the convenience store, according to deputies. Investigators said Randolph admitted to the attack and directed them to bloody clothing he had discarded. The Florida Supreme Court denied Randolph’s appeals last week. He had argued that a lower court had abused its discretion in denying him access to public records and that his own lawyers had acted without his consent. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Randolph’s final appeal Thursday morning. Including Randolph, a total of 44 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S., and more than a dozen other people are scheduled to be put to death during the rest of 2025 and next year. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, trailed by Alabama, South Carolina and Texas with five each. Two more executions are planned next month in Florida under death warrants signed by DeSantis. Mark Allen Geralds , 58, is scheduled for Florida’s 18th execution on Dec. 9. He was convicted of fatally stabbing a woman during home invasion robbery. Frank Athen Walls , 58, is set for Florida’s 19th execution on Dec. 18. He was convicted of fatally shooting a man and woman during home invasion robbery, and he later confessed to three other killings. Florida’s lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections. ___ Follow David Fischer on the social platform Bluesky: ‪@dwfischer.bsky.social‬"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-cop30-c2c66ea017db8984102702320142ce76","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:57:08+00:00","title":"COP30 Climate Talks Collapse Over Lack of Fossil Fuel Phase-Out Plan","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the final day of the COP30 UN climate talks in Belem, Brazil, a proposal from host country Brazil failed to explicitly identify fossil fuel combustion as the cause of global warming, sparking fierce opposition from over 80 nations, including the European Union, the UK, France, Germany, and climate-vulnerable island states like Tuvalu, Palau, and Vanuatu.

Several nations and environmental groups on Friday slammed proposals in the final stages of this year’s U.N. climate talks for failing to explicitly mention the cause of global warming — the burning of fuels such as oil, gas and coal — with one negotiator warning the talks are on “the verge of collapse.” Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a top negotiator for Panama, said the decades-long United Nations process risks “becoming a clown show” for the omission. His nation was among 36 to object to a proposal from conference president André Corrêa do Lago of host Brazil because it doesn’t provide an explicit guide map for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, nor strengthening climate-fighting plans submitted earlier this year. Do Lago countered by telling negotiators he thought they were “very close” to doing what they set out to do when they started meeting a week ago. The Brazilian proposals came on what was supposed to be the last day of the talks, and on the heels of a fire on Thursday that briefly spread through pavilions of the conference known as COP30 on the edge of the Amazon. No one was seriously hurt but the fire meant a largely lost day and increased the likelihood the talks would sprawl into the weekend, as they frequently do.

EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra reminded negotiators that countries had gathered at the edge of the Amazon to bring down emissions and transition away from fossil fuels. “Look at the text. Look at it. None of it is in there. No science. No global stocktake. No transitioning away. But instead, weakness,” Hoekstra said in a closed-door meeting of negotiators, according to a transcript provided by the EU . “Under no circumstances are we going to accept this. And nothing that is even remotely close, and I say it with pain in my heart, nothing that is remotely close to what is now on the table.” “After 10 years, this process is still failing,” Maina Vakafua Talia, minister of environment for the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said in a speech earlier in the day. “The Pacific came to COP30 demanding a survival road map away from fossil fuels. Yet the current draft texts that came out (do) not even name the main threat for our very survival and existence.” A key text among host Brazil’s proposals deals with four difficult issues. They include financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change and getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions. Then there’s the dispute over creating a detailed road map for the world to phase out the fossil fuels that are largely driving Earth’s increasing extreme weather. Any such plan would expand on a single sentence — to “transition away” from fossil fuels — agreed upon two years ago at the climate talks in Dubai. But no timetable or process was spelled out and powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia oppose it. More than 80 nations have called for stronger direction and Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also pushed for it earlier this month. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore urged nations to stand firm in opposition and hailed Lula’s involvement. “Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump and Russia under Vladimir Putin have bullied countries to support an absurd proposal,” Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said the latest document “even deletes the proposal to phase out the ridiculous and self-destructive subsidies for fossil fuels. This is an OPEC text,” he said, for the organization that represents oil-producing countries.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More On phasing out fossil fuels, the proposal “acknowledges that the global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.” The text “also acknowledges that the Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster,” referring to the 2015 climate talks that established the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the mid-1800s. A key issue is that the 119 national emissions curbing plans submitted this year don’t come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Though the text didn’t address a fossil fuel transition road map, it could eventually end in a vaguely worded section about a plan for the next couple years in a separate road map. The 36 nations who thought the text didn’t go far enough included wealthy ones such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany along with smaller climate vulnerable islands Palau, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu. They said the proposal doesn’t meet “the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.” Colombian Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres said the presidency’s proposal is unacceptable to “those of us who are committed to life on this planet, to climate justice.” Getting everyone in one room Agreements at these talks are officially reached when no nation objects and typically require many rounds of negotiations. In practice, the proceedings can end with agreements adopted and the presidency adjourning the meeting after noting any objections.

Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/ex-leader-of-reform-uk-in-wales-jailed-for-10-years-over-pro-russia-bribes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:48:31+00:00","title":"Ex-leader of Reform UK in Wales jailed for 10 years over pro-Russia bribes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales and a former Member of the European Parliament, has been sentenced to 10 years and 6 months in prison for accepting bribes from pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Oleg Voloshyn between 2018 and 2019.

European Parliament.\n\nLondon’s Central Criminal Court, better known as the Old Bailey, sentenced Nathan Gill, 52, to 10 years and six months in prison on Friday.\n\nA former Member of the European

statements and television appearances at his behest.\n\n“You abused a position of significant authority and trust,” Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said as the sentence was handed down, adding that Gill’s conduct “fundamentally compromised the integrity of a supranational legislative body”.\n\n“You accepted payments from foreign nationals, made statements on important international matters at their behest, utilised scripted material presented as your own, and orchestrated the involvement of other MEPs,” Cheema-Grubb said.\n\nGill was first elected to the European Union legislature with the EU-sceptic UKIP party, which was then  led by Reform UK’s current leader Nigel Farage .\n\nHe later represented the Brexit Party, another party led by Farage, before leaving the European Parliament when the United Kingdom left the EU in early 2020.\n\nHe was stopped at Manchester Airport in September 2021 as he attempted to travel to Russia and was charged in February of this year following an

and indicted for treason in Ukraine.\n\nPolice said messages were found on Gill’s mobile phone between him and Voloshyn that provided coded references to their financial dealings.\n\nThere were also references to other members of the European Parliament, including British representatives and politicians from the Netherlands.\n\nFarage – whose Reform UK party is  topping several public opinion

2025-11-21T08:21:45+00:00\n\nTitle: Countries sharply split on fossil fuels on COP30 climate summit final day\n\nCountries remain bitterly divided over the future of fossil fuels as the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, is slated to end in Brazil’s northern city of Belem, potentially in a haze of recriminations.\n\nDelegates at the two-week conference have failed to reach a deal as Brazil circulated a new draft proposal on Thursday that did not include a roadmap to transitioning away from fossil fuels – nor mention the term “fossil fuels” at all.\n\nMore than 30 other countries from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Pacific co-signed a letter in response, slamming the draft and saying they “cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly and equitable transition” from nonrenewable energy sources.\n\nThe commitment to moving away from fossil fuels – including natural gas, coal and crude oil –  was considered a landmark achievement of COP28 in Dubai . Even then, the deal stopped short of calling for a “phase-out” amid fierce lobbying from oil-producing countries.\n\nA first draft of the COP30 text, which was publicised on Tuesday, did contain the option of building a roadmap away from such fuels.\n\nBut major producers and consumers, including China, India, Saudi Arabia and Russia, rejected the proposal, several news outlets reported, quoting negotiators familiar with discussions.\n\nThe United States – which backed a phase-out in 2023 under former President Joe Biden – did not send a delegation to this year’s conference.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has long slammed the climate crisis and global warming as a “hoax.”\n\nAnother point of contention is climate finance, meaning money to help countries adapt to climate change. Brazil’s newest draft calls for tripling climate financing by 2030 compared with 2025 levels.\n\nBut it left unclear who exactly would provide the financing, whether it be wealthy states, the private sector or multilateral development banks. Western countries have historically baulked at providing cash to poorer nations dealing with the worst climate change effects.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the conference was “down to the wire” and urged countries to “address disinformation aimed at derailing the transition”.\n\n“Communities on the front lines are watching too, counting flooded homes, failed harvests, lost livelihoods,” he added. “They have heard enough excuses.”\n\nThe languishing negotiations were meanwhile interrupted on Thursday by a fire that forced thousands of delegates to evacuate the conference.\n\nFlames erupted  in an exhibition pavilion and rapidly spread up the building’s internal shell as attendees finished lunch, lasting about six minutes.\n\nNineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation, but no injuries were reported, according to event and fire officials.\n\nDelegates have reported various problems with electrical wiring, air conditioning and infrastructure throughout COP30, which is taking place at the edge of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThousands of protesters have also  marched in Belem  to call for Indigenous people and environmental defenders to be heard.\n\nIn a joint statement on Thursday evening, the UN and COP30 leaders said the fire site was “safe” and shifted the focus back to the negotiations, which may spill into the weekend.\n\n“We still have substantial work ahead, and we trust that delegates will return to the negotiations in a spirit of solidarity and determination to ensure a successful outcome for this COP,” the statement said."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5467347","dateOfPublication":"2025-08-09","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Why good houseguests don't actually 'make themselves at home'","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article, written by Andee Tagle for NPR’s LifeKit, provides a comprehensive guide to being a considerate guest when staying at a friend or family member’s home.

themselves at home' \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Saturday, August 9, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         With summer slowly winding down, many of you may be hoping to use the last of that sweet vacation time to get out of town and visit friends and family. But how do you ensure that your presence in someone else's home feels like a gift and not a burden? For etiquette expert  Elaine Swann , being a star houseguest isn't all that complicated. Whether you're couch surfing at your college roommate's pad or taking the kids to stay at your aunt's house, being a considerate guest starts by simply respecting someone else's space — no matter how comfortable you may feel with them. \"You still want to have reverence for the fact that this is not really your home,\" Swann says. Swann, who runs  The Swann School of Protocol , an etiquette training program, answers tricky questions about staying at a loved one's place — and how to be a guest who gets invited back. Listen to the podcast episode version of this story here.  Is it rude to ask my friend if I can stay at her place if I'm passing through her neck of the woods?  Swann shares a helpful rule: As long as you'd feel comfortable hosting that person in your own home, you shouldn't feel sheepish about asking to stay with them when you're visiting their town. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The rule comes with a few caveats, Swann says. Give your host at least three weeks' notice. Also, don't automatically assume they can host you just because you asked. \"Make sure you're prepared for the answer to be yes or no, and accept and respect whatever answer they give you,\" Swann says. How long is too long of a visit?  Keep your visit short and sweet. Four days and three nights is generally ideal, Swann says. Unless you're visiting for a larger occasion like a holiday, she says a long-weekend-type visit is a sweet spot. It's long enough to spend quality time together but short enough to be over before anyone can feel too cramped or frustrated. Adjust accordingly for the size of the space and the needs of everyone involved, Swann says. For instance, if you're traveling with a colicky infant, your cousin's studio apartment might not be the best fit. Instead, maybe book a nearby hotel and visit your cousin during the day. I'd love to spend time with my host during my visit, but I also want to do my own thing. How do we get on the same page?  Once you have a visit on the books, be proactive and communicative about the specifics of your stay to avoid any unnecessary awkwardness. Are you hoping your buddy can take some time off to hit the theme parks with you? Is your partner's family the type that loves to cook for people, or should you plan to get your own meals? Make your host aware of any pertinent information for your visit, like allergies or specific physical needs for your stay. You wouldn't want your new boyfriend's mom to spend hours making her famous shrimp gumbo if you're terribly allergic to shellfish, for example. Or if you just broke your ankle and can't climb stairs, you should double-check whether your friend's fifth-floor apartment has a working elevator. The host told me to \"make myself at home.\" Do they mean that?  When a host tells you to make yourself at home, that doesn't mean you should prop your shoes up on the couch or eat all the snacks in the pantry. Swann says that's generally a cue to fend for yourself — you don't have to ask if you want a drink of water or an extra napkin. But as a houseguest, you still want to be your best, most respectful self, Swann says. Offer to do the dishes, take out the trash, treat your host for a meal — or all of the above. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Be mindful of your footprint. Don't make your host feel like a hurricane blew through their home, Swann says. So for starters, don't overpack, and make sure you keep whatever you bring tidy and contained. Don't leave your clothes lying around or take up all the space on the bathroom counter. Ack! I forgot to bring a gift for the host. Is it too late?  Some etiquette rulebooks advise never to show up to someone else's home empty-handed, but Swann maintains it's fine if you don't have something ready for your host right away. Just be sure to give them a gift by the time you leave. \"Go on a reconnaissance mission while you're in that house,\" she says, with eyes and ears out for a thoughtful contribution to the household. Are they home chefs in need of a new cookbook? Did you catch your bestie lingering on some local art at the farmer's market? A host gift should be a small gesture of thanks, Swann says, with bonus points if it can recall your visit. I don't want to rent a car during my stay. Is it OK to ask the host if I can use their car?  \"Do not rely on your host for transportation,\" Swann says. For example, don't ask your host to pick you up from the airport or   borrow their car to go sightseeing. \"Do not impede on their personal schedule. Instead, make sure that you are self-sufficient. That's the best way to be a houseguest,\" Swann says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Can I ask my host if I can stay for just a few more days? I'm enjoying my time.  Don't overstay your welcome. \"The best way to end your visit on a positive note is to make sure there is an actual end,\" Swann says. That means departing when you told your host you would, rather than delaying by a few hours or days, and taking the time to say goodbye and thank you to each member of the household. When you get home, don't forget to return the favor and invite your host to your place for the next get-together. \"Staying with family and friends and sharing that time is such a wonderful thing to do,\" Swann says. \"We need more of that.\" We want to hear from you: Share your tips for being a gracious host  Now, we'd like to hear from the hosts.

Change Conference, known as COP30, after a fire broke out at the venue in Belem, Brazil.\n\nThere were no injuries in Thursday’s blaze, according to Brazil’s Tourism Minister Celso Sabino. In a news conference afterwards, he downplayed the seriousness of the fire.\n\n“There was a small fire here, which is possible at any large event,” he told journalists. “This small fire could happen anywhere on planet Earth.”\n\nOrganisers reported that the evacuation was “fast” and the fire was controlled within six minutes, leaving only minor damage.\n\nThirteen people were treated for smoke inhalation, according to a joint statement from the UN and COP30 leaders.\n\nThe affected area, known as the Blue Zone, is expected to remain closed until 8pm local time (23:00 GMT).\n\nThe cause of the fire remains unclear. But Helder Barbalho — the governor of the state of Para, where the summit is taking place — told the Brazilian channel GloboNews that authorities believe a generator failure or short circuit might have sparked the incident.\n\nOn social media, Barbalho assured the public that other parts of the COP30 conference zone continued to be in operation.\n\n“We will find out what caused it, whether we can restart work here in the Blue Zone today or not,” he wrote. “The Green Zone is operating normally.”\n\nReports emerged about 2pm local time (17:00 GMT) of flames in the Blue Zone pavilion, a restricted area for negotiators and accredited media.\n\nVideos on social media showed scenes of panic and security officials ordering attendees to exit the venue.\n\ncaralho, fogo na zona azul aqui da COP 30.  uma loucura de gente correndo. meu deus!  pic.twitter.com/ebXubnHwiR\n\n— ralfer (@ralferr)  November 20, 2025\n\nAl Jazeera spoke to Fernando Ralfer Oliveira, an independent journalist who was in the Blue Zone when the fire broke out and shared footage of the flames.\n\n“I was in the big corridor that leads to the meeting rooms when a commotion of people started running. I had my phone in my hand and immediately started recording,” said Ralfer.\n\n“When I got close to the pavilion, someone ran past me shouting, ‘Fire, fire, fire!’ So I ran a little and managed to record that bit of the fire. But at that moment, security was already coming towards us in force, saying ‘Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate.’”\n\nRalfer and other evacuees were then directed to the COP30’s food court area, located outside the pavilion.\n\nRoughly an hour after the fire broke out, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which organises the conference, sent an email to attendees saying that the local fire service would conduct “full safety checks” at the venue.\n\nThey then announced the Blue Zone’s continued closure: “Please note that the premises are now under the authority of the Host Country and are no longer considered a Blue Zone.”\n\nThe Blue Zone fire happened a week after Brazil responded to the UN’s concerns around safety at COP30.\n\nOn November 13, Simon Stiell, the executive secretary with the UNFCCC, sent a letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his government, raising issues ranging from faulty doors to water leaks near light fixtures.\n\nThat same day, the Brazilian government published a statement saying that “all UN requests have been met”, including the repositioning and expansion of police forces between the Blue and Green Zones."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/despite-gaza-ceasefire-we-havent-seen-the-worst-btselem-chief","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"14:53:41Z","title":"Despite Gaza ceasefire, ‘we haven’t seen the worst’: B’Tselem chief","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, B’Tselem’s executive director Yuli Novak warns that the situation remains catastrophic, with over 69,000 Palestinian deaths and widespread destruction.

the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, has a warning for politicians in the United States and across the world: The situation in Israel-Palestine is “disastrous”.\n\nDespite the US-brokered ceasefire that scaled back the  Israeli attacks  in Gaza, Novak told Al Jazeera this week that the conditions are more dangerous than ever.\n\n“Our warning is that we haven’t seen the worst,” she said, stressing that Israel must be held accountable for its abuses in Gaza.\n\nOver the past two years, numerous human rights groups have released reports accusing Israel of carrying out a genocide in Gaza — a campaign to destroy the Palestinian people.\n\nUnited Nations investigators , for instance, determined that Israel’s actions in the territory matched the definition of genocide under international law.\n\nBut B’Tselem provided another layer of analysis with  its landmark report , called Our Genocide, in July.\n\nIt dissected the decades-long history of Israeli policies that laid the groundwork for the carnage in Gaza, including the apartheid system, demographic engineering, the systemic dehumanisation of Palestinians, and a culture of impunity for abuses.\n\nThose conditions, Novak said, have been further entrenched since the war began.\n\n“As long as these things are still in place, we are very concerned that the violence that we’ve seen is not over,” she said.\n\nSince the ceasefire started, Israel has killed at least 360 Palestinians in Gaza, including 32 in a wave of air strikes across the territory earlier this week.\n\nThe Israeli government has also continued to impose restrictions on humanitarian aid to the enclave, including on  temporary shelters  needed to replace tents for tens of thousands of Palestinians who faced flooding earlier this month.\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians and turned most of Gaza into rubble.\n\nIn the occupied West Bank, conditions have been worsening, with intensifying settlement expansion and deadly Israeli military raids.\n\nOn Thursday, Human Rights Watch released a report documenting that Israeli forces  forcibly displaced  32,000 Palestinians from their homes in Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams.\n\nIsraeli settlers have also increased their attacks, regularly descending on Palestinian villages to torch homes and vehicles and at times  kill civilians  — often with the protection of the Israeli military.\n\nNovak stressed that settler attacks are a form of Israeli state violence.\n\n“They are Israeli civilians living in the West Bank being armed by the state. Sometimes, many of them wear [army] uniforms. Sometimes these are soldiers on reserve duty that are on a break,” she said.\n\nSome Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , have condemned settler violence, but Novak dismissed the move as a ploy to blame Israel’s policies on a “small group of crazy settlers”.\n\nNovak also highlighted that most of the killing and destruction in the West Bank is carried out by official Israeli forces, not settlers. “So this is another arm of the violence that Israel inflicts on Palestinians,” she said.\n\nNovak and her B’Tselem colleague Kareem Jubran have been in Washington, DC, this week, where they met with US lawmakers, including Democratic Senators Peter Welch, Jeff Merkley and  Chris Van Hollen,  as well as Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.\n\nNovak said the group wants to stress the need for accountability for the genocide in Gaza.\n\n“We are talking about a governing system, the Israeli system, that conducted genocide for two years — war crimes on a daily basis — and got away with it with no accountability,” she said.\n\n“The current situation is probably the most dangerous that we’ve ever been in because not only this violence and this criminality took place, it was also normalised, and in any moment, it can start again, go back to the same scale.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that there is peace in the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years because of the truce he helped broker in Gaza.\n\nAnd earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution backing the US president’s 20-point  plan for Gaza , which calls for an end to the fighting, gradual Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of an international force to the territory.\n\nThe plan would also see Hamas disarm and Gaza’s governance handed over to an international commission, dubbed “the Board of Peace”.\n\nIt has no accountability or compensation mechanism for the horrors that Israel unleashed on Gaza for two years.\n\nNovak said Trump’s plan is disconnected from the reality on the ground.\n\n“It just allows everybody to move on, instead of dealing with the situation and demanding Israel not only to be held accountable but also stop this kind of systematic oppression over the Palestinians,” she said.\n\nSince the Security Council embraced the ceasefire deal, Israel has faced less international pressure. Even the push for measures like suspending the country from the  Eurovision  singing contest  and European football have lost momentum.\n\nOn Monday, Germany announced it was  lifting restrictions  on weapons exports to Israel, citing the truce.\n\n“That is probably what scares us the most because we see regression here,” Novak said.\n\nJubran, B’Tselem’s field research director, also stressed the need for accountability, saying that the previous rounds of wars on Gaza  from 2006 onwards  enabled the genocide.\n\n“That’s what allowed the genocide system to be more brazen in order to do its crime against the Palestinians in Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nDespite the lack of political or legal accountability, Novak hailed the growing international public awareness of Israel’s atrocities, which she said politicians are choosing to ignore.\n\n“If there is something that gives us hope in this really, really terrible moment, it is the fact that many people around the world are able to see through the Israeli propaganda and just to make sense of what their eyes saw, and some of the voices of the victims were able to come out from Gaza and from the West Bank,” she said.\n\n“So people do understand. We are in the moment where people need to demand their leaders and politicians to hold Israel accountable.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/qatari-emir-arrives-in-dr-congo-after-rwanda-visit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:49:48+00:00","title":"Qatari emir arrives in DR Congo after Rwanda visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani made a state visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), marking his first trip to the country and occurring shortly after a visit to Rwanda.

Republic of Congo (DRC), days after the government and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group signed a framework agreement for a peace deal aimed at ending fighting in the country’s east.\n\nOn his first trip to the African country, the Qatari leader was welcomed in the capital Kinshasa on Friday by DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and other officials.\n\nThe frameworkd agreement  was the latest in a series of documents signed in recent months as part of efforts, backed by the United States and Qatar, to end decades of fighting in eastern DRC that has been an enduring threat to regional

Rwanda, where he met President Paul Kagame.\n\nRwanda has long denied allegations that it has helped M23, which has seized more territory in the DRC than it has ever previously held.\n\nAl Jazeera’s

aimed at stabilising eastern DRC played a key role in strengthening dialogue between the two governments.\n\nIn eastern DRC, violence has continued despite the various diplomatic processes in Washington and Doha, with Congolese authorities and M23 trading blame for violating the principles of earlier agreements and deliberately delaying  talks .\n\nAnd the prolonged negotiations do not address the threat from a multitude of other armed groups operating in the volatile east.\n\nM23 seized Goma, eastern DRC’s largest city, in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, triggering a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\nQatar has hosted multiple rounds of direct talks between the DRC government and M23 going back to April, but they have dealt largely with preconditions and confidence-building measures.\n\nThe two sides  agreed  in July to a declaration of principles that left many key issues at the root of the conflict unresolved, and in October they reached a deal on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.\n\nThe July deal signed in Doha followed an earlier, separate peace agreement between the Congolese and Rwandan governments made in Washington in June."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/red-cross-to-cut-2900-jobs-slash-budget-as-donors-reduce-support","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:19:20Z","title":"Red

support\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will impose deep cuts to its operations in 2026, slashing almost one-fifth of its annual budget and shedding 2,900 jobs as global donors  retreat  from humanitarian financing.\n\n“We face a dangerous convergence of escalating armed conflicts, significant cuts to aid funding and a systemic tolerance for grave breaches of international humanitarian law,” ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe organisation confirmed that its spending will fall to $2.2bn, warning that the wider aid sector is facing a “financial crisis of unprecedented proportions”.\n\nA spokesperson said the  United States  remains the ICRC’s largest donor but has reduced its contributions this year, mirroring funding  drops  from other traditional backers, including the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\n“The ICRC remains committed to working on the front lines of conflict, where few others can operate,” Spoljaric insisted, but warned that “the financial reality is forcing us to make difficult decisions to ensure we can continue to deliver critical humanitarian assistance to those who need it most.”\n\nGovernments are diverting budgets towards defence and security, leaving humanitarian agencies scrambling to sustain programmes while conflict, displacement and need continue to escalate.\n\nThe shift comes as Washington overhauls  foreign assistance  under President Donald Trump, whose “America First” agenda has reshaped spending priorities.\n\nThe combined cuts have forced the Geneva-based body to roll out one of its most significant restructurings in decades. The job losses amount to roughly 15 percent of its 18,500-strong workforce and include about 200 posts in Geneva, where the ICRC was founded in 1863.\n\nThe organisation said it will merge departments, streamline management and focus on frontline conflict operations to preserve its core mission. Despite the reduced budget, the ICRC insisted it will maintain its presence in Sudan, Ukraine, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nAround a third of the staff reductions will come through voluntary departures or by leaving positions unfilled.\n\nThe ICRC, active in more than 90 countries, supports civilians in conflict zones, visits prisoners of war, and acts as a neutral intermediary.

But after the fall of al-Assad, it claimed its 1974 disengagement agreement with Syria was void and has  widened its occupation in Syria  by some 400sq km (155sq miles).\n\nMohammad Mazen Mriwed, an elder from Jubata al-Khashab village, told Al Jazeera that people are living in fear of Israeli incursions and can no longer work their land.\n\n“Since the fall of the regime, many are no longer building or cultivating,” he said. “We don’t know how the government will respond, but true relief will come only when the occupation ends.”\n\nAl Jawalan Hospital in Quneitra has been subjected to multiple attacks by Israeli forces in recent years. The below satellite image combination shows it before and after Israeli strikes.\n\nIn addition to taking Syrians, Israeli forces are also fortifying their positions with large berms and watchtowers. Sanad, Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency, has verified the establishment of nine new Israeli military camps in Syria since December 2024.\n\nLocal elders estimate 1,700 acres (688 hectares) of land seized by Israeli forces includes orchards, fields and grazing lands.\n\nIsraeli forces have flattened entire areas, uprooting trees believed to be hundreds of years old, to build more military presence on Syrian soil, villagers and shepherds say.\n\nMohammad Makkiyah went too close to a watchtower and was shot by an Israeli sniper. He says the first shot missed his head, but as he ran from a volley of fire, a bullet hit his leg.\n\nIn a nearby house, Hussain Bakr’s son and brother were taken five months ago.\n\n“We complained to the UN and the Red Cross, who told us that they will ask the Israelis, but there is no response,” Bakr told Al Jazeera. “They are innocent, taken for no reason.”\n\nResidents say interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa should remember his own family’s displacement when Israel occupied the Golan Heights. The president has previously said his grandfather was forced to flee the area in 1967.\n\nGovernment representatives say they are trying for solutions through diplomacy.\n\nBut until the missing come home, words offer little solace.\n\n“The situation is painful for the families and for us as a government,” Jamal Numairi, a People’s Assembly member from Quneitra, told Al Jazeera. “To the families, I say: the government will spare no effort to resolve the issue. I consider them kidnapped, not as prisoners.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/students-taken-from-catholic-school-in-central-nigeria-in-latest-abduction","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:38:02+00:00","title":"Students taken from Catholic school in central Nigeria in latest abduction","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a disturbing escalation of violence, students from St. Mary’s Catholic School in Agwara, Niger State, Nigeria, were abducted by armed gangs, with reports indicating 52 students were taken.

climate summit after Australia concedes bid\n\nTurkiye will host next year’s COP31 summit in the city of Antalya, ending a long standoff with Australia over the location of the top United Nations climate meeting.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Thursday morning that Australia had reached an arrangement with Turkiye to host negotiations in the lead-up to the 2026 UN climate meeting along with Pacific nations while Turkiye will assume the presidency of the official meeting.\n\n“What we’ve come up with is a big win for both Australia and [Turkiye],” Albanese told the Australian public broadcaster ABC Radio Perth.\n\nThe announcement comes as  this year’s COP30 climate summit  in the Brazilian city of Belem is due to close on Friday.\n\nAustralia had been pushing to host COP31 next year as a “Pacific COP” alongside low-lying South Pacific nations, which are increasingly threatened by rising seas and climate-fuelled disasters.\n\nDespite Australia’s efforts, Turkiye refused to back down in its bid to host the summit.\n\nTurkiye had said that as an emerging economy, it would promote solidarity between rich and poor countries at its summit, which would have a more global rather than regional focus.\n\nTurkiye will now have just 12 months to plan the meeting at the Antalya Expo Center due to the unusually long process to secure hosting duties and the lack of procedures in place to handle a situation in which two countries wanted to host at the same time.\n\nThe presidency of the  Conference of the Parties (COP)  to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change traditionally rotates among five regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, and Western Europe and others.\n\nAustralia and Turkiye both fit within the latter category of Western Europe and others, meaning that Australia will now have to wait another five years until it can bid to host the meeting again.\n\nEthiopian Minister for Planning and Development Fitsum Assefa Adela announced last week that her country had already secured the support of African negotiators to host COP32 in 2027.\n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) quickly voiced frustration with Australia for dropping its bid to cohost the COP with its Pacific island neighbours.\n\n“We are all not happy and disappointed it’s ended up like this,” PNG Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency.\n\n“What has COP achieved over the years? Nothing,” Tkatchenko said. “It’s just a talk fest and doesn’t hold the big polluters accountable.”\n\nAustralian Senator Steph Hodgins-May from the Australian Greens party said Australia’s withdrawal from hosting the meeting reflected the current Labor government’s “continued coal and gas approvals” as Australia continues to increase its exports of  fossil fuels .\n\n“This is extremely disappointing, but it shows that the world recognises Australia’s significant role in making dangerous climate change worse,” May said.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, both Australia and Turkiye are heavily dependent on coal, oil and gas for energy, but both countries have also been making progress in renewable energy.\n\nAustralia’s federal Labor government had hoped to showcase renewable energy progress in the state of South Australia by hosting the conference in the state’s capital, Adelaide.\n\nHowever, the proposal was complicated by the city’s struggle to cope with a significant toxic algal bloom that has been taking place offshore for eight months.\n\nAlgal blooms are one of many complications caused by warming oceans, an aspect of climate change that climate scientists and other experts said can be improved only by rapidly reducing dependence on fossil fuels."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, showcasing musical performances from artists, but provides no specific details about individuals, organizations, or events.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","Music","Artists"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/explosion-at-glue-factory-in-eastern-pakistan-kills-at-least-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:16:02+00:00","title":"Explosion at glue factory in eastern Pakistan kills at least 16","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An explosion at a glue-making factory in the Malikpur area of Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan, killed at least 16 people and injured seven.

2025-11-21T12:10:20+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump’s 28-point Ukraine plan in full: What it means, could it work?\n\nThe United States has revealed all 28 points of its  proposal  to end the Russia-Ukraine war to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The plan, which has been heavily criticised as far too favourable to Russia by many observers, is in its draft stage and has yet to be made public. However, a Ukrainian official is understood to have provided the details to international media.\n\nHere is a closer look at the points and the significance of this plan.\n\n1. Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed.\n\n2. A comprehensive, non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. All ambiguities of the last 30 years will be considered settled.\n\n3. It is expected that Russia will not invade neighbouring countries and NATO will not expand further.\n\n4. A dialogue will be held between Russia and NATO, mediated by the US, to resolve all security issues and create conditions for de-escalation to ensure global security and increase opportunities for cooperation and future economic development.\n\n5. Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.\n\n6. The size of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\n\n7. Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO, and NATO agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\n\n8. NATO agrees not to station troops in Ukraine.\n\n9. European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland.\n\n10. The US security guarantee will have the following caveats:\n\n11. Ukraine is eligible for European Union (EU) membership and will receive short-term preferential access to the EU market while this issue is being considered.\n\n12. A powerful global package of measures will be provided to rebuild Ukraine, including but not limited to:\n\n13. Russia will be reintegrated into the global economy:\n\n14. Frozen funds will be used as follows:\n\n15. A joint American-Russian working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.\n\n16. Russia will enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine.\n\n17. The US and Russia will agree to extend the validity of treaties on the non-proliferation and control of nuclear weapons, including the START I Treaty.\n\n18. Ukraine agrees to be a non-nuclear state in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\n19. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will be launched under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine, 50:50.\n\n20. Both countries undertake to implement educational programmes in schools and society aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance of different cultures and eliminating racism and prejudice:\n\n21. Territories:\n\n22. After agreeing on future territorial arrangements, both the Russian Federation and Ukraine undertake not to change these arrangements by force. Any security guarantees will not apply in the event of a breach of this commitment.\n\n23. Russia will not prevent Ukraine from using the Dnipro River for commercial activities, and agreements will be reached on the free transport of grain across the Black Sea.\n\n24. A humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues:\n\n25. Ukraine will hold elections in 100 days.\n\n26. All parties involved in this conflict will receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.\n\n27. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J Trump. Sanctions will be imposed for violations.\n\n28. Once all parties agree to this memorandum, the ceasefire will take effect immediately after both sides retreat to the agreed points to begin implementation of the agreement.\n\nZelenskyy met with US Army officials in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss the proposals, which have been drawn up by US and Russian officials without any input from Ukraine or its European allies.\n\nAfter the meeting, Zelenskyy  said  in an address: “The American side presented points of a plan to end the war – their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it’s all genuine.”\n\nZelenskyy added, “From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace – one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace – with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Ukrainian people.”\n\nThe Ukrainian president said that he will now discuss the proposals with Ukraine’s European allies.\n\nNo.\n\n“Zelenskyy had a nuanced response – he said ‘We will work on it’,” Keir Giles, a Eurasia expert at the London political think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHowever, he added that agreeing to the terms of the plan in its current form would be “catastrophic” for Ukraine because of the heavy concessions Kyiv is being asked to make.\n\nWhile European leaders have not reacted to the 28-point plan, they have indicated that they would not accept a plan that requires Ukraine to make such concessions.\n\n“Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”\n\nFor now, Ukraine’s allies are not commenting. European Council President Antonio Costa said that the EU has not yet been officially informed about the US plan, so “it makes no sense to comment” on it.\n\nMore reactions from Europe might come starting from Saturday, when Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak at the G20 summit.\n\n“A 28-point plan was made public. We will discuss the situation both with European leaders and with leaders here on the sidelines of the G20,” von der Leyen said, according to UK media.\n\nThe US has not made details of the plan public, and officials from Washington have not commented on it.\n\nRussia has denied that there have been formal consultations between the US and Russia on a peace plan.\n\n“Consultations are not currently under way. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungarian PM and close Trump ally Viktor Orban seemed to back the plan on Friday.\n\nIn an X post, Orban wrote that Trump’s plan had “gained new momentum”.\n\n“The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time, the war would never have broken out. It is clear that once he sets his mind on something, he does not let it go, and he has certainly set his mind on ending the Russian-Ukrainian war,” Orban wrote.\n\nPresident  @realDonaldTrump 's peace initiative has gained new momentum. A 28-point peace plan is on the table, an American negotiating delegation is in Kyiv, and expectations are high worldwide. The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time,…  pic.twitter.com/J2cagATvc5\n\n— Orbán Viktor (@PM_ViktorOrban)  November 21, 2025\n\nExperts said the terms of the 28-point plan and how they would be implemented are far from clear.\n\n“The terms are unenforceable, nonsensical and vague that they cannot be enforced without months of wrangling,” Giles said.\n\nFor instance, he said, point 9 states that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. However, it is unclear what “European” or “fighter jets” mean.\n\nGiles said “European” could mean the European Union or European countries. “‘Fighter jets’ is a militarily meaningless term, which provides plenty of room for argument,” he added.\n\nIt is unclear what security guarantees the US is offering Ukraine. Further details of these have not been released.\n\nPoint 10 states that the “US will receive compensation for the guarantee”. While it is unclear what the specific compensation would be, experts suggest that point 14 may shed some light on this.\n\nPoint 14 of the plan states that $100bn in frozen Russian assets plus $100bn from Europe would be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction.\n\nThe plan further states that the US will receive 50 percent of the profits from the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is not specified how these profits would be generated.\n\nThe plan also states that remaining Russian funds would go into a joint US-Russia investment vehicle for projects to build ties and deter future conflict, again with little detail.\n\nGiles said this likely refers to about $300bn in Russian Central Bank assets, which have been frozen by the US and European countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn October this year, EU leaders suggested a “reparations plan” under which it would use frozen Russian assets to lend Ukraine $164bn to buy European weapons, and for reconstruction.\n\nGiles said that the point about Russian frozen assets was likely deliberately added by negotiators from Moscow because “Russia has already written off frozen assets abroad, and now is dangling that as a carrot in front of the US”.\n\nGiles added that, according to earlier plans, however, “those funds were supposed to rebuild Ukraine”.\n\nHowever, now we don’t know whether the reconstruction will be of a “free Ukraine or Russian efforts of Russification in occupied Ukraine”, he said.\n\nPoint 26 of the plan states that all parties involved in the conflict will receive “full amnesty for their actions during the war”.\n\nIn March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC)  issued an arrest warrant  for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.\n\nThe US cannot unilaterally grant amnesty to an individual convicted of war crimes by an international organisation.\n\n“Writing off the war, pretending it never happened, rolling back sanctions and ignoring war crimes is just one of the elements of this draft list where the US is assuming the cooperation of the rest of the world,” Giles said.\n\nHe added that a large number of countries across the world strongly believe in international law, and are likely to push back on this point.\n\n“If a negotiation like this were to be enforced, then it is the US endorsing the seizure of territory through open arms aggression, and it will be encouragement to other aggressors around the world that they have the US blessing,” Giles warned.\n\nThe plan says that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be considered Russian territory.\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas region.\n\nCrimea was seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and remains a matter of dispute.\n\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas, including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nRussia also controls 75 percent of  Zaporizhia  and  Kherson  in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. The plan says that the current battle lines will be frozen in these regions.\n\nParts of the proposal aim to bring Russia out of the isolation imposed on it by the Western world since it started the Ukraine war.\n\nPoint 12 states that Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.\n\nThe G8 –  currently the G7  – was an unofficial forum for the leaders of eight major industrialised nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US.\n\nRussia was part of the G8 but was ejected following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nThe plan also mentions the establishment of a US-Russian investment vehicle that would implement joint projects in specific areas. However, further details about this have not been revealed.\n\nThe plan also mentions the formation of a joint US-Russian working group on security issues to ensure compliance with the plan.\n\nAnalysts are doubtful. “This agreement is not going anywhere – similar to the previous ones,” Giles said.\n\nHe called it “another iteration of the merry-go-round that we’ve been on many times before”.\n\nHe said he believes the plan will receive pushback from Ukraine and Europe, which will want to negotiate changes."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/us-government-to-nix-october-inflation-report-after-history-making-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:50:51Z","title":"US government to nix October inflation report after history-making shutdown","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has canceled the release of the October 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Real Earnings summary due to a 43-day government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025.

2025-11-21T19:50:51+00:00\n\nTitle: US government to nix October inflation report after history-making shutdown\n\nThe United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has announced it will not release inflation information for the month of October, citing the consequences of the recent government shutdown.\n\nOn Friday, the bureau updated its website to say that certain October data would not be available, even now that government funding has been restored and normal operations have resumed.\n\n“BLS could not collect October 2025 reference period survey data due to a lapse in appropriations,” it wrote in a statement. “BLS is unable to retroactively collect these data.”\n\nThe cancelled data includes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — a report that is commonly used to calculate inflation by measuring the changing costs of retail items — and the Real Earnings summary, which tracks wages among US workers.\n\nFor some of the reports, including the Consumer Price Index, the bureau said it would use “nonsurvey data sources” to make calculations that would be included in a future report for the month of November.\n\nThe November Consumer Price Index will also be published later than anticipated, on December 18.\n\nThe most recent government shutdown was the longest in US history, spanning nearly 43 days.\n\nIt began on October 1, after the US Congress missed a September 30 deadline to pass legislation to keep the government funded.\n\nRepublicans had hoped to push through a continuing resolution that made no changes to current spending levels. But Democrats had baulked at the prospect, arguing that recent restrictions to government programmes had put healthcare out of reach for some US citizens.\n\nThey also warned that insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire by the end of the year. Without an extension to those subsidies, they said that insurance premiums for many Americans will spike.\n\nRepublicans rejected the prospect of negotiating the issue until after their continuing resolution was passed. Democrats, meanwhile, feared that, if they passed the continuing resolution without changes, there would be no further opportunity to address healthcare spending before the end of the year.\n\nThe two parties hit an impasse as a result. Non-essential government functions were halted during the shutdown, and many federal employees were furloughed.\n\nOnly on November 10 did a breakthrough begin to emerge. Late that night, seven Democrats and one independent broke from their caucus to side with Republicans and pass a budget bill to fund the government through January 30.\n\nThe bill was then approved by the House of Representatives on November 12, by a vote of 222 to 209. President Donald Trump signed the legislation into law that very same day.\n\nTrump had openly sought to leverage the shutdown to eliminate federal programmes he saw as benefitting Democratic strongholds.\n\nHe also attempted to blame the political left for the lapse in government services, though he acknowledged public frustration with Republicans after Democrats won key elections in November.\n\n“If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” he told a breakfast for Republican senators on November 5. “That was a big factor.”\n\nThe Trump administration had warned as early as October that the month’s consumer price data would be negatively affected as a result of the shutdown.\n\nIn a White House  statement , Trump officials touted Trump’s economic record while slamming a potential lapse in the government’s collection of data. Once again, they angled the blame for any slowed economic growth at the Democrats.\n\n“Unfortunately, the Democrat Shutdown risks grinding that progress to a halt,” the statement said.\n\n“Because surveyors cannot deploy to the field, the White House has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for the first time in history — depriving policymakers and markets of critical data and risking economic calamity.”\n\nSeptember’s Consumer Price Index, the most recent available, showed that inflation across all retail items rose about 3 percent over the previous 12-month period.\n\nFor food alone, inflation for that period was estimated at 3.1 percent."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/zelenskyy-says-trumps-ukraine-plan-must-ensure-real-and-dignified-peace","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"14:20:32+00:00","title":"Zelenskyy says Kyiv faces ‘difficult choice’ as Trump pushes for end to war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns that Ukraine faces a critical choice between preserving its dignity and freedom or losing U.S. support, amid mounting pressure from former U.S. President Donald Trump to accept a 28-point peace plan that includes territorial concessions, military size restrictions, and NATO exclusion.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy  says his country risks losing its dignity and freedom — or Washington’s backing — as it mulls a United States plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war that observers say endorses many of Moscow’s demands.\n\nIn a speech delivered on Friday in the street outside his office, Zelenskyy appealed to Ukrainians for unity and said he would never betray Ukraine.\n\n“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history … Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” the Ukrainian leader said.\n\n“I will fight 24/7 to ensure that at least two points in the plan are not overlooked – the dignity and freedom of Ukrainians,” he added.\n\nZelenskyy’s comments come as US President Donald Trump appears to have given Kyiv less than a week to agree to  his 28-point proposal  to end the war, nearly four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nTrump told Fox News Radio on Friday that he believed next Thursday was “an appropriate” deadline for Ukraine to accept the deal.\n\nCiting two unnamed people familiar with the matter, the Reuters news agency reported that the Trump administration has threatened to cut Kyiv off from intelligence sharing and  weapons supplies  to pressure it into accepting the plan.\n\nAccording to media reports this week,  the US proposal  includes several stipulations that Russia has been pushing for, including that Ukraine cede additional territory, curb the size of its military and be barred from joining NATO.\n\nAt the same time, the West would lift sanctions on Russia, and Moscow would be invited back into the Group of Eight (G8), which it was expelled from for seizing and annexing Crimea in 2014, the AFP news agency said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called the US proposal “a new version” of what was discussed with Washington ahead of  a summit in Alaska  earlier this year.\n\nNoting that Moscow had received the “modernised plan”, Putin said during a meeting of Russia’s National Security Council on Friday that he believed it “could form the basis for a final peace settlement”.\n\nBut the Russian leader said that the “text has not been discussed with us in any substantive way, and I can guess why”, adding that Washington has so far been unable to gain Kyiv’s consent.\n\n“Ukraine is against it. Apparently, Ukraine and its European allies are still under illusions and dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield,” Putin said.\n\nAs Ukraine faces mounting pressure from the Trump administration to agree to the deal, Ukrainian forces are also facing serious challenges on the battlefield and deadly bombings by Moscow.\n\nAt least 31 people were killed and 94 others wounded after a Russian missile attack struck a residential apartment block in the  western city of Ternopil  earlier this week, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nSeparately, the Kremlin said about 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers were trapped on the eastern bank of the Oskil River, in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian military.\n\nThe report comes as Ukrainian forces have been trying to  fend off a Russian attempt  to seize the eastern cities of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, where fighting has raged. Russian forces also have been  gaining ground  in the region of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nOn Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the country’s battlefield advances should convince Zelenskyy that “it is better to negotiate and do it now rather than later”.\n\n“The space for the freedom of decision-making is shrinking for him as territories are lost,” Peskov told reporters.\n\nJim Townsend, a former US Defense Department official for Europe and NATO-related issues, said the situation on the battlefield and the Ukrainian military’s declining capabilities as the war continues, add to the pressure Ukraine faces to reach a deal.\n\n“If the US pulls back and says, ‘Look if you’re not going to agree to this, we’re not going to be supporting you’, then there’s going to be a lot of pressure on Zelenskyy to take the agreement – no matter how hard it feels,” Townsend told Al Jazeera.\n\nFor their part, Ukraine’s European allies, which were not consulted on the US proposal, have stressed the need to safeguard “vital European and Ukrainian interests”.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held talks with Zelenskyy on Friday, stressing that they welcomed the “US efforts” to end the war.\n\nBut they assured the Ukrainian leader of their “unwavering and full support for Ukraine on the path to a lasting and just peace”.\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, also said the EU and Ukraine want peace but will not give in to Russian aggression. “This is a very dangerous moment for all,” Kallas told reporters.\n\n“We all want this war to end, but how it ends matters. Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded; ultimately, the terms of any agreement are for Ukraine to decide.”\n\nReporting from Berlin on Friday, Al Jazeera’s Dominic Kane said while European leaders are presenting a united front of support for Ukraine, major questions remain about what concessions would be palatable to them.\n\nHe noted that, ultimately, the views of European leaders will not be the deciding factor in any deal. “Moscow, Kyiv and Washington, DC, appear to be the capitals where everything will be decided,” Kane said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced a directive to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing, sparking global concern and expert scrutiny.

2025-11-03T12:27:39+00:00\n\nTitle: How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/india-says-cop30-should-be-about-climate-adaptation-but-dries-up-key-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:08:16+00:00","title":"India wants COP30 to focus on climate adaptation, but dries up own fund","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India faces a growing climate crisis, with over 32 million people displaced between 2015 and 2024, and more than 160,000 displaced in the first six months of 2025 due to floods, landslides, and rising sea levels.

2025-11-20T05:08:16+00:00\n\nTitle: India wants COP30 to focus on climate adaptation, but dries up own fund\n\nIndian-administered Kashmir  – On the night of September 2, Shabir Ahmad’s home was swallowed by mud and swept into the river after relentless rains triggered a landslide in Sarh village in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Reasi district.\n\n“I had been building my house brick by brick since 2016. It was my life’s work. Only less than a year ago, I had finished constructing the second floor, and now there is nothing,” the 36-year-old father of three children told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmad’s was among nearly 20 houses in Sarh lost to the Chenab River that night, including one belonging to his brother, as dozens of families helplessly watched their farmlands, shops and other properties worth millions of rupees vanish without a trace.\n\n“We don’t even have one inch of land left to stand on,” said Ahmad from a government school in Sarh, where his family and other villagers were sheltering after the deluge.\n\nThe tragedy at Sarh was among the latest of increasingly frequent climate disasters across India that destroy lives and livelihoods, and displace millions of people to an uncertain future.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), climate-related disasters forced more than 32 million people from their homes in India between 2015 and 2024, with 5.4 million displacements recorded in 2024 alone – the highest in 12 years. This makes India one of the three nations most affected by  internal displacements  due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.\n\nMoreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.\n\nTo help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.\n\nManaged by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of  vulnerable households .\n\nDuring a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.\n\n“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.\n\nIn another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.\n\n“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.\n\nBut the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.\n\nGovernment records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.\n\nSince the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.\n\nAs a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.\n\n“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.\n\nAn official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.\n\n“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.\n\nIn the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.\n\n“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.\n\nThis year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.\n\nIn Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBehera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIn West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.\n\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.\n\n“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.\n\nIn the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.\n\nThakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.\n\nYet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.\n\nA government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.\n\n“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”\n\nActivist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.\n\n“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.\n\n“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”\n\nClimate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.\n\n“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.\n\nBhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.\n\n“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.\n\n“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”\n\nBhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.\n\n“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.\n\nBack at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.\n\n“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.\n\n“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/landslides-kill-dozens-as-heavy-rains-lash-southeast-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:57+00:00","title":"Landslides kill dozens as heavy rains lash Southeast Asia","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of people have been killed across Southeast Asia due to landslides caused by heavy rains during the rainy season.

Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe geomagnetic storm, rated G4 by NOAA, is affecting Earth due to multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, which arrived between November 9 and 11.

issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9k0mrm2ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:21:53.658+00:00","title":"Steve Rosenberg: Putin uncompromising as leaked plan reaches Moscow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Vladimir Putin has expressed openness to a peace deal with Ukraine, stating that the US-proposed 28-point peace plan—developed during talks between Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US envoy Steve Witkoff in Miami—could serve as a foundation for a final settlement.

They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan  to end the war in Ukraine .\n\nThe same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\n\n\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".\n\nWhich brings us back to the peace plan.\n\nOn Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.\n\nAddressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.\n\nPresident Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.\n\nThe 28-point proposal,  which has been widely leaked and reported on,  appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy  Steve Witkoff .\n\nAccording to drafts of the peace proposal, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.\n\n\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.\n\nA peace proposal does not automatically mean peace.\n\nWhat if there's no agreement?\n\nPro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\n\n\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\n\n\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"\n\nBut after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\n\n\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.\n\nIt's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.\n\nMany. But not everyone.\n\nSome elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled  on Nato's Article 5 . That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\n\n\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"\n\nThe full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.\n\nFor now, though, Russia's  war on Ukraine continues ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, effective December 10, 2025, which includes platforms such as Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9rp0knj6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:30:47.676+00:00","title":"Superman edition found in mum's attic is most valuable comic ever at $9.12m","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A rare original Superman #1 comic from June 1939, discovered in a California attic by three brothers during a Christmas cleaning in 2024, has sold for $9.12 million at Heritage Auctions, setting a new world record for the most valuable comic book ever sold.

adventures, it was in a remarkably pristine condition.\n\nNow it has become the highest-priced comic book ever sold, fetching $9.12m (£7m) at auction.\n\nTexas-based Heritage Auctions, which hosted Thursday's sale, called it the \"pinnacle of comic collecting\".\n\nThe brothers found six comic books, including Superman #1, in the attic underneath a stack of newspapers inside a cardboard box and surrounded by cobwebs in 2024, Heritage said in a press release.\n\nThey waited a few months before contacting the auction house, but once they did, Heritage Auctions vice-president Lon Allen visited them in San Francisco within days, according to the auction house.\n\nThe brothers, who have chosen to withhold their names, are \"in their 50s and 60s, and their mom had always told them she had an expensive comics collection but never showed them\", Mr Allen said in Heritage's press release.\n\n\"It's a twist on the old 'Mom threw away my comics' story.\"\n\nTheir mother had held on to the comic books since she and her brother bought them between the Great Depression and the beginning of World War Two, Heritage said.\n\nMr Allen added that the cool northern California climate was perfect for preserving old paper.\n\n\"If it had been in an attic here in Texas, it would have been ruined,\" he said.\n\nThat helped CGC, a large third-party comics grading service, give this copy of Superman #1 a 9.0 rating on a 10-point scale, topping the previous record of 8.5.\n\nAnd at its sale price of over $9m, including buyer's premium, Superman #1 easily beat the previous highest-priced comic book ever sold by $3m.\n\nAction Comics No. 1, the 1938 work that first introduced Superman, sold for $6m last year.\n\nThe youngest brother said in Heritage's press release that the box had remained forgotten in the back of attic.\n\n\"As the years unfolded, life brought about a series of losses and changes,\" he said. \"The demands of everyday survival took centre stage, and the box of comics, once set aside with care and intention, was forgotten. Until last Christmas.\"\n\nHe added: \"This isn't simply a story about old paper and ink. This was never just about a collectible.\n\n\"This is a testament to memory, family and the unexpected ways the past finds its way back to us.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q5ewew4geo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:44:03.871+00:00","title":"COP30: UN climate summit drops mention of fossil fuels from draft deal","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, a major diplomatic rift has emerged over fossil fuels, with countries like the UK and France pushing for a strong transition away from fossil fuels, while oil-producing nations including Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia oppose it, citing economic and energy needs.

as the meeting is meant to be nearing its end.\n\nAt the heart of the row is a disagreement over how strong a deal should be on working to reduce the world's use of fossil fuels, whose emissions are by far the largest contributor to climate change.\n\nThe dispute pits groups of countries against each other, but all 194 parties must agree in order to pass a deal at the two-week summit.\n\nRepresentatives and observers from inside a guarded negotiating room say the talks have become very difficult.\n\nOne negotiator inside the room told the BBC that there \"is a lot of fighting\".\n\nBrazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and some countries including the UK want the summit to commit nations to stronger, faster action to reduce their use of fossil fuels.\n\nIt would advance a deal made two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, that committed countries to \"transition away from fossil fuels\".\n\nA first draft of an agreement in Brazil offered three options including timeframes, but the latest version has no mention of fossil fuels.\n\nFrench Environment Minister Monique Barbut said the deal was being blocked by \"oil-producing countries - Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, but joined by many emerging countries.\" She added: \"As it stands now, we have nothing left.\"\n\nThe BBC has approached Saudi Arabia for comment.\n\nSpeaking to journalists outside the negotiating room, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said the UK was determined to keep \"alive\" at the talks a plan to take further action on fossil fuels.\n\n\"It's hard, it's sweaty, it's frustrating. There's a big divergence of views,\" he said.\n\n\"We are determined that one way or another, this innovative idea, with the support of more than 80 countries to have a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels, is kept alive at this COP,\" he said.\n\nMr Miliband added: \"I think that in 10-20 years time people will say, \"You were the generation that saw the climate crisis around you. Did you take action? Did you rise to the challenge. It's that sense of what will people think of us in the future that keeps me going.\"\n\nSome developing countries have not backed the deal on fossil fuels because they want richer nations to first deliver on promises to give climate finance to help them cope with or adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n\"We need adaptation financing because we are already doing a lot to reduce emissions,\" Aisha Moriana, head of Pakistan's delegation, told BBC News.\n\n\"Who will pay the cheque? We are looking forward to receiving that money,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked if Pakistan would support the fossil fuel deal if it received new promises about finance, Ms Moriana replied: \"That is something which cannot happen in a few hours, and it requires a lot of financing.\"\n\nIn the hallways, groups of campaigners are chanting \"fossil fuels out\" and hanging banners saying \"Stop Amazon oil\" and \"1.5C under threat: time to act\".\n\n\"A good outcome could mean giving us a future and a present that it is worth fighting for,\" International Youth Climate Movement campaigner Shurabe Mercado, from Mexico told BBC News.\n\n\"Our generation is most at risk and we are most at stake.\"\n\nThe meeting is a fraught and delicate diplomatic process as countries jostle to protect their national interests, while also attempting to address the issue of climate change.\n\nSome observers question the value of the complex, legalistic talks which almost always over-run.\n\nBut others point to the significant advances in measures to tackle climate change, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, and protection of nature in recent years linked to COP agreements.\n\nOther issues discussed at the COP include the gap in climate finance promised by richer nations to developing nations that are most impacted by climate change.\n\nThe new draft deal called for global efforts to triple financing available to countries by 2030.\n\nBut it did not say if this should come from richer nations or from other sources, like the private sector.\n\nThis could anger poorer countries who want stronger support from richer nations and heavily criticised a deal at last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, which they considered paltry.\n\nDeforestation has also been been a fraught issue, which takes place on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nThe new draft deal weakened previous language around tackling deforestation.\n\n\"The wildlife and indigenous people who call the forest their home deserve better than this,\"  said Kelly Dent, Director of External Engagement for World Animal Protection.\n\nThe two-week meeting has been interrupted by two evacuations.\n\nLast week a group of protesters broke into the COP venue in Belém carrying signs reading \"Our forests are not for sale\".\n\nOn Thursday a fire broke out,  burning a hole through the sheeting covering the venue and causing 13 smoke inhalation injuries. The summit was evacuated and closed for at least six hours.\n\nThe summit has been praised for including the largest number yet of delegates from indigenous groups.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter  to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

2025-11-21T08:01:06+00:00\n\nTitle: Ukraine doubts Russia’s desire for peace amid reports of US-drafted plan\n\nUkrainian defenders have been attempting to mount a defence of the surrounded eastern cities of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, a month into Russia’s latest attempt to seize them.\n\nOn Thursday, as fighting on the front lines raged, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  claimed  Russia has no interest in ending the war amid reports Washington and Moscow  have drafted  a 28-point peace plan. The proposal is said to heap pressure on Ukraine to give up land, something Kyiv has throughout the war said was a red line.\n\n“Russia has no real desire for peace; otherwise, they would not have started this war,” he said in a recorded message posted to X. “The United States has the power to ensure that Russia’s willingness to end the war finally becomes serious.”\n\nRussia dedicated 150,000 troops to capturing the enclave containing Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, Ukraine said, which is now surrounded on three sides, with Ukrainian supply lines open only to the west.\n\nZelenskyy told US senators in a bipartisan virtual meeting on November 12 that Russia had suffered its greatest casualty rate of the entire war in Pokrovsk, estimating it at 25,000 – though he did not specify over what period.\n\nUkraine’s military defence efforts were highlighted by the story of a soldier from the 155th Mechanized Battalion, who reportedly spent 100 days in the shell of a destroyed building, separated from his unit, until he was rescued.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff released a video of the fighting in Pokrovsk, purporting to show reinforcements arriving in the city, and suggesting lines of communication remained operative.\n\n“These are shots of our equipment arriving, disembarking and advancing groups. In these shots, additional assault groups are advancing into the eastern part of the city,” the video voiceover said. It said the arrivals were reinforcing the Ukrainian stronghold in the northern part of Pokrovsk.\n\nLater, the video purported to show troops “clearing positions on the western outskirts of Pokrovsk and in the area of ​​the entrance to the city. In the administrative building in the city centre, soldiers of the regiment are holding positions”.\n\nUkrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging platform: “There is an ongoing constant struggle with small enemy assault infantry groups, and, less frequently, the destruction of light enemy equipment.”\n\nThe main action belonged to drone operators on both sides, who are locked in a fierce contest for control of the skies.\n\nThe head of Ukraine’s National Guard, which is fighting in Pokrovsk, said Kyiv needs to step up drone production and acquisition to stop Russian troops while they are still out in the open.\n\n“We need to stop the enemy more as they approach on foot, so that they do not infiltrate,” Okeksandr Pivnenko told Reuters.\n\nHe said Ukraine had achieved drone parity in some parts of the front, but not all.\n\nThe Russian command appeared undecided about whether to infiltrate or surround the cities, and was pursuing a dual objective, slowing its advance, said the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank.\n\n“The Russian military command does not appear to be focusing forces and means on completing the encirclement of the Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad area, which would normally be the fastest and least costly way to seize the entire area, and instead continues to pursue some level of head-on attacks,” said the ISW.\n\nPart of Russia’s problem appeared to be the “active defence” of Dobropillia, a town to the northwest of Pokrovsk, which Russia had attempted to capture in August as part of a sweeping encirclement plan. That attack invited a counteroffensive which liberated 189 square kilometres (73sq miles) of occupied land and left the Russian encirclement in ruins.\n\nRussia’s 2nd and 51st Combined Arms Armies, attacking Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad from the south and north, respectively, appear to be attempting a more limited envelopment of the enclave and a simultaneous head-on infiltration using small groups of soldiers.\n\nThe infiltration of Pokrovsk from the south has appeared to be advancing during the past week, while Ukrainian defenders still held the northern neighbourhoods.\n\nRussia was attacking other parts of the 1,200km (745-mile) front as well, testing for weaknesses and experimenting with the infiltration tactics that have proven successful in Pokrovsk.\n\nDuring the week of November 13-19, it seized several villages in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia.\n\nOne of Russia’s advantages is its control of the air. Its aircraft are dropping  200-250 glide bombs  a day on Ukrainian front lines. Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief Vadym Skibitskyi told Reuters that Russia planned to produce 120,000 glide bombs next year, which could raise the daily average to 330.\n\n“It is possible to shoot them down, but the quantity of these aerial bombs produced in the Russian Federation … is enormous,” Skibitskyi said. “This is a threat. A threat that will require us to respond appropriately.”\n\nRussia has used long-range drones and missiles to attack Ukraine’s cities.\n\nDuring the past week, it launched just under 1,600 drones and 78 missiles. Ukraine intercepted 86 percent of the drones and three-quarters of the missiles.\n\nMany Russian drones and missiles have struck residential areas repeatedly.\n\nThe worst such attack came on November 19. At least 25 people, including children, were killed in the western Ukrainian city of  Ternopil , when Russia pulverised the top floors of a nine-storey apartment building. At least 80 others were reported wounded.\n\nUkraine, which continues to respond with attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, said it struck an oil terminal in Novorossiysk on Friday. Russia suspended export operations at the terminal, which account for 2 percent of the global oil trade.\n\nUkraine also struck the Saratov oil refinery and a fuel depot near the Engels airbase.\n\nA day later, the Ryazan refinery also suspended operations due to a strike.\n\nBut it was unclear whether this campaign was having the intended impact on Russia’s ability to provide its armed forces with diesel.\n\nRussia was reported to have lost 20 percent of refining capacity between August and October, but that was quickly reduced to 3 percent by activating spare capacity, Reuters more recently reported, citing sources and data.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zelenskyy  met with his Turkish counterpart , Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has in the past successfully interceded with Russia to broker prisoner-of-war exchanges.\n\nWhile there, Zelenskyy reportedly swerved a meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff, who was apparently bearing the 28-point peace plan from the White House.\n\nThe plan entailed territorial concessions to Russia and a reduction in the size of Ukraine’s armed forces, two anonymous sources told Reuters. Both are key Moscow demands. A Ukrainian source said Kyiv had no role in drafting the proposal.\n\nEarlier, Axios had reported that Washington was working on a 28-point peace plan.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists there were “no innovations” in Russia’s stance “that can be reported to you”.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine and its European allies have drafted a ceasefire plan that demands the complete and unconditional cessation of hostilities. Europe has not demanded that Ukraine cede territory and advocates strengthening Kyiv’s armed forces.\n\nZelenskyy clearly leans towards the European plan. His European tour started in Athens, where he and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced their intention to co-produce surface drones.\n\nOn Monday, Zelenskyy was in  Paris  to sign a 10-year deal with President Emmanuel Macron for weapons purchases and co-production, which includes 100 Rafale F4 aircraft by 2035, eight SAMP/T air defence systems with six launchers each, air defence radar, air-to-air missiles, and guided aerial bombs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spain became the first country to announce a direct allocation within the European Union’s Security Action For Europe (SAFE) programme for weapons co-production with Ukraine, in the amount of 215 million euros ($250m). Spain also promised 40 Iris-T missiles and planned to provide long-range radars.\n\nOn Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested he may provide Ukraine with the long-range Taurus cruise missiles it has long sought.\n\n“In recent months, we have been working intensively with the Ukrainian government on projects that we technically refer to as ‘long-range fire’. The Ukrainian army will be equipped with such weapon systems,” Merz said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4ny1wd443o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:07:13.693+00:00","title":"Ohio policeman acquitted of murdering pregnant woman Ta'Kiya Young suspected of shoplifting","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On August 24, 2023, Ohio police officer Connor Grubb fatally shot 21-year-old pregnant woman Ta'Kiya Young in a Kroger parking lot in Columbus, Ohio, after she was approached on suspicion of shoplifting alcohol.

They have warned that he will stop at nothing to evade the police — even possibly undergoing plastic surgery to avoid being caught.\n\nThe case offers an extraordinary look at the underbelly of an alleged multinational, $1-billion-a-year, violent criminal enterprise allegedly led by a former Olympian.\n\nIt also puts a spotlight back on Mr Paradkar, who is no stranger to the media in Canada. The criminal lawyer is known for defending  Dellen Millard, a wealthy Toronto heir who  is a multiple murderer.\n\nAt times, Mr Paradkar himself became the story. He faced allegations of helping Millard smuggle clandestine letters from jail to his then-girlfriend, in an effort to sway witnesses in one of his murder trials. Mr Paradkar has denied this.\n\nHe was also the subject of a profile in the newspaper the Toronto Sun in 2017, where he was described as being \"too flashy for his own good\". He wore $1,200 Louboutin shoes to court and flaunted his Maseratis on Instagram.\n\n\"I break the mold a bit,\" Mr Paradkar told the newspaper at the time. \"I just do my own thing as long as I stay within professional standards.\"\n\nAuthorities say Mr Wedding enlisted the help of Mr Paradkar when his criminal enterprise started to crumble, after US authorities intercepted one of his cocaine shipments in April 2024 in California. Two other packages were stopped in August and October 2024, and all the couriers were arrested.\n\nIn all three cases, Mr Paradkar allegedly arranged legal representation for the couriers in order to give Mr Wedding access to privileged information on his other clients, several of whom Mr Wedding wished to murder, authorities said.\n\nLater in October 2024, the FBI announced a string of arrests in relation to Mr Wedding, identifying him for the first time as the alleged head of a major criminal enterprise with alleged operations across Canada, the US and Latin America.\n\nAuthorities revealed that they had an inside man who was co-operating as a key witness in the case. Canadian media have since identified him as Jonathan Acebedo-Garcia, a Canadian-Colombian man who is said to have been a longtime associate of Mr Wedding's.\n\nThe drug lord is said to have then enlisted others to track Acebedo-Garcia down, including a Montreal organised crime leader, Atna Ohna, and a Colombian madame, Carmen Yelinet Valoyes Florez.\n\nOn the side, Mr Wedding allegedly tapped a Calgary man, Allistair Chapman, to allegedly pay a crime gossip blog C$10,000 to post information about Acebedo-Garcia's whereabouts. Mr Chapman is among those now arrested and facing extradition to the US.\n\nThe blog's operator, Gursewak Singh Bal, was also arrested, with authorities alleging he posted a photo of Acebedo-Garcia and his wife to his blog and implying that he is \"a snitch\".\n\n\"Good chance he'll never be found again,\" Mr Bal allegedly wrote.\n\nOthers were said to have been recruited by Mr Ohna and Ms Florez to help track the witness down. Edwin Basora-Hernandez, identified in the indictment as a reggaeton artist living in Canada, allegedly helped secure his phone number in exchange for C$500 to C$1,000.\n\nAnother man was allegedly hired by Mr Wedding to fly to Colombia and Saudi Arabia to search for him.\n\nThe witness was eventually found in Colombia, where he was tracked down by individuals on a motorcycle to a restaurant inside a shopping centre. Another unnamed suspect then entered, approached Acebedo-Garcia and shot him while he ate, according to the indictment, killing him instantly.\n\nA photo of the corpse was then allegedly sent to Mr Wedding, to be circulated \"as a warning\" to others who may cross him, the indictment said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Ohna is said to have been rewarded a bejeweled necklace for his role in the murder.\n\nOne of the more unusual elements of this alleged criminal enterprise is the man supposedly at the very top – Mr Wedding.\n\nDescribed as a \"modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar\" by FBI director Kash Patel, the Canadian from Ontario was previously a professional snowboarder. He represented Canada in the 2002 Winter Olympics men's parallel giant slalom event, inspiring the namesake for the FBI investigation into his alleged enterprise – Operation Giant Slalom.\n\nMr Wedding gave up winter sports after his Olympic run, and he briefly enrolled in a British Columbia university before dropping out.\n\nAccording to profiles on him in Rolling Stone and Toronto Life, he became a bodybuilder and a bouncer at Vancouver-area night clubs, and later started growing and selling cannabis before the drug was made legal in Canada.\n\nIn 2009, he was convicted for cocaine trafficking as part of a larger operation and served a prison sentence in Texas before being deported back to Canada. He largely fell under the radar until October 2024, when the FBI first announced fresh charges against him, placing him as the head of a vast criminal enterprise.\n\nDuring that announcement, authorities accused him and his accomplices of triggering \"an avalanche of violent crimes, including brutal murders\".\n\nThey alleged that his drug trafficking network used trucks and stash houses to transport Colombian cocaine to the US and Canada from Mexico.\n\nAuthorities believe he is currently hiding in Mexico under the protection of the Sinaloa drug cartel.\n\n\"Instead of using the privileges that come with being an Olympic athlete to do good for people, he did the opposite,\" US Attorney Martin Estrada alleged at the time.\n\n\"He chose to become a major drug trafficker and he chose to become a killer.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:15:11.302+00:00","title":"What we know about leaked US draft plan to end Russia's Ukraine war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked draft US-Russia peace plan proposes significant territorial and military concessions to Ukraine, including the transfer of Ukrainian-controlled areas in eastern Donbas to Russian de facto control, a reduction of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000, and the elimination of Ukraine's eligibility for NATO. The plan also includes vague security guarantees, a non-binding commitment to non-NATO membership, and a financial structure where $100 billion in frozen Russian assets are allocated to US-led reconstruction with the US receiving 50% of profits.

plan to end Russia's Ukraine war\n\nThe draft US-Russia peace plan has been widely leaked and we now know that it proposes to hand over those areas of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the  de facto  control of Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\nLatest versions of the text also call for Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces to 600,000 people.\n\nBut what else is known about the text and who stands to benefit from it most?\n\nThere are 28 key points and there are several on the face of it that could be acceptable to Ukraine. Others come across as vague and imprecise.\n\nUkraine's sovereignty would be \" confirmed\"  and there would be a  \"total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine and Europe\" , with robust or reliable  \"security guarantees\"  for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days.\n\nIf Russia were to invade Ukraine a  \"robust co-ordinated military response\"  is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal.\n\nAlthough elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place, they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed.\n\nBut on security guarantees, there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to  treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.\n\nAmong the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\"\n\nCeding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.\n\n\"The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\"\n\nUkraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nWhile 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.\n\n\"Our red lines are clear and unwavering,\" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: \"There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.\"\n\nThe draft also proposes that \" Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States\" .\n\nIn other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are \" indivisible and inviolable\".\n\nElsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied in other areas.\n\nThe draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:\n\n\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\"\n\n\"Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.\"\n\nThere is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries.\n\nJoining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: \"Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.\"\n\nOther draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a  \"non-nuclear state\".\n\nThat appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.\n\nSeveral points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with  \"Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy\"  and invited back into the G8 group of powers.\n\nThat seems a long way off for now, with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.\n\nIf the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.\n\nThe draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested  \"in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\" , with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.\n\nThe sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).\n\nSome €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.\n\nThe rest of those frozen assets would go to a  \"US-Russian investment vehicle\" , under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.\n\nSeveral commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.\n\nBut it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.\n\nWe know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.\n\nEqually US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as \"a list of potential ideas for ending this war\", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nIn some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent.\n\nThe European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.\n\nRussian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow. Russia's response has so far been cautious but Putin has said it  could be the \"basis\" for a peace settlement .\n\nThe handover of Ukrainian territory to Russia, even in a demilitarised zone, is the biggest sign of a slant towards Russia's narrative, but freezing the front lines in the south could prove difficult for the Kremlin which has annexed both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in its constitution.\n\nOne of the proposals is for the lifting of sanctions to be  \"agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis\"  - which Moscow will probably see as far too slow.\n\nHowever, a plan for a  \"full amnesty\"  for all parties will go down well in Moscow and very badly in Kyiv and European capitals.\n\nCommentators have pointed out that while there do appear to be major concessions to Putin, some of the requirements for Nato might be too vague for Kremlin tastes.\n\nRussia has also consistently demanded that a peace plan would need to eliminate what it sees as \"the root causes\" of the war. One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.\n\nSome of the other 28 points of the draft also a nod to Russia's claims of discrimination of Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them.\n\nOne point is explicit but even-handed:  \"Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\"\n\nAnother apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe -  \"equally between Russia and Ukraine\" ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7gy4rp9mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"00:32:38.646+00:00","title":"New images show engine flying off before UPS cargo plane crash","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A newly released investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board reveals that during takeoff from Louisville, Kentucky, the engine of a UPS cargo plane detached and struck the fuselage before exploding into flames, resulting in 14 fatalities and 23 injuries.

resignation of a judge who was disciplined for wearing an Elvis Presley wig in court and occasionally playing the singer's songs during proceedings.\n\nMatthew EP Thornhill, the longest-serving circuit judge in St Charles County, is a self-described Elvis lover, according to his biography page.\n\nBut his love for the King of Rock'n'Roll contributed to a disciplinary commission demanding his suspension, citing his frequent \"irrelevant\" Elvis references in court.\n\nIn a letter explaining his actions, Judge Thornhill said his aim was \"to add levity at times when I thought it would help relax litigants\".\n\n\"I now recognize that this could affect the integrity and solemnity of the proceedings,\" Judge Thornhill wrote in a letter dated 12 November to the Missouri Supreme Court.\n\nAccording to a report by Missouri's Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges, which investigates allegations of judicial misconduct, Judge Thornhill \"would routinely wear an Elvis Presley wig on or about October 31\" - or Halloween - in court while conducting court business.\n\nThe report shows images of the judge sitting on the bench while donning an Elvis wig with his signature black pompadour and sunglasses.\n\nIt adds that, on occasion, Judge Thornhill would give litigants or witnesses the option of being sworn in while playing Elvis music from his phone.\n\nHe would also refer to the singer occasionally during court proceedings, including mentioning his date of birth or death and lyrics from his music, according to the inquiry report.\n\nJudge Thornhill's burning love for all things Elvis is well-documented.\n\nIn an interview with a local media outlet last year, he said he had visited Graceland, where the singer lived and is buried, 13 times.\n\nHe added that Elvis was always on his mind since he was a child.\n\nThe disciplinary report also cites unrelated conduct, like sharing his political affiliation or preferred candidates in elections from the bench, as well as promoting his own election campaign by asking witnesses, lawyers and litigants if they had seen his \"Thornhill for Judge\" signs around town.\n\nThe commission found that Judge Thornhill had \"failed to maintain order and decorum in the courtroom\", and recommended he be suspended without pay for six months, then serve for another 18 months before retiring.\n\nIn the 12 November letter, Judge Thornhill did not dispute any of the allegations, saying they are \"substantially accurate\" and acknowledged he had made a mistake.\n\nHe agreed to the terms set out by the commission, which allowed him to conclude his service on the bench and retire after 20 years."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5m8qdl6n9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:24:14.139+00:00","title":"Palestinians forced from West Bank refugee camps

Israeli demolitions go on\n\n\"They punished ordinary people. This is collective punishment.\"\n\nIt's been more than nine months since 54-year-old Nehaya al-Jundi last saw her home in the Palestinian refugee camp of Nur Shams, in the occupied West Bank, after being forced to evacuate by the Israeli military.\n\n\"They punished the infrastructure, the institutions and people of the camp.\"\n\nIn a café in nearby Tulkarm, Nehaya speaks to the BBC about her family's panicked flight, as Israeli troops stormed into the camp in early February.\n\nFor two days Nehaya watched and listened in terror as military bulldozers razed the area around her house.\n\n\"We were besieged inside our house and couldn't leave,\" she recalls, describing how power, water and internet connections were all severed.\n\nEventually, on 9 February, Nehaya escaped with her 75-year-old husband, Zaydan, and their teenage daughter Salma.\n\n\"When we got out, I was shocked by the damage in the area,\" she says.\n\nThe Israeli military launched \"Operation Iron Wall\" in late January, sending troops and armour into Nur Shams and two other refugee camps in the northern West Bank, to tackle Palestinian armed groups it said were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.\n\nThe operation followed a largely unsuccessful attempt by the Palestinian Authority to quell the activities of local gunmen, many of them affiliated with Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, in the parts of the West Bank where it governs and controls security.\n\nBy the end of February, the three camps had been all but emptied in the largest displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six Day War.\n\nIn Jenin, where the largest of the three camps dominates the western side of the city, we hear similar stories of terrified flight and long months of dislocation.\n\n\"We stayed three days in the house without power or water,\" says 54-year-old Nidal Abu Nase, a development consultant and freelance book editor.\n\n\"The shooting never stopped.\"\n\nWhen the chance to escape finally arrived, Nidal's family left with little more than their clothes, thinking they would soon be back.\n\n\"I never managed to get home to collect my stuff,\" he says.\n\nTen months on, Nidal and at least 32,000 residents of the three camps still don't know when they will be allowed to return to their homes.\n\nWhen that moment finally comes, many will find they no longer have homes to go back to.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says Israel has demolished 850 homes and other buildings across all three camps.\n\nOther estimates rate the extent of the damage much higher.\n\nIn a report published earlier this week, HRW said Israel's forced, prolonged evacuations and the associated destruction \"amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity\".\n\n\"The Geneva Conventions prohibit displacement of civilians from occupied territory except temporarily for imperative military reasons or the population's security,\" HRW said.\n\nThe group said Israel's actions \"may also be considered 'ethnic cleansing'\".\n\nIn February, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said he had instructed the army \"to prepare form a prolonged stay in the camps that have been cleared for the coming year\".\n\nAs the year's end approaches, there's still no end in sight.\n\nAn Israel Defense Forces spokesperson told the BBC that \"in order to locate and uproot the terrorist infrastructure at its source, the IDF has had to operate for an extended period of time.\"\n\nBut already in August, Katz called the operation a success, saying \"there is no terror in the camps and the scope of terror alerts in [the West Bank] has dropped by 80%.\"\n\nThe IDF says it has dismantled bomb-making and other weapons facilities hidden inside all three camps.\n\nIt is not clear why Operation Iron Wall continues, although demolitions are still happening in the camps.\n\nIt seems clear from the pattern of destruction and the Israeli military's own explanations, that the operation has longer term goals.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the IDF said armed groups had been able to exploit the densely built environment of the camps, making it hard for the army to move freely.\n\n\"The IDF is acting to reshape and stabilise the area,\" the IDF spokesperson said. \"An inseparable part of this effort is the opening of new access routes inside the camps, which requires the demolition of rows of buildings.\"\n\nSatellite images from all three camps show the extent of the damage, with narrow, barely visible streets now wide enough for military vehicles, including tanks, to pass through.\n\nThe demolitions, the IDF spokesperson said, were \"based on operational necessity\", with residents able to submit objections and petitions to Israel's Supreme Court.\n\nAll such petitions - some of which argued that Israel's actions violated international humanitarian law - have been rejected.\n\nAccording to HRW, Israel's military has been given \"wide discretion to invoke the grounds of urgent military necessity\".\n\nHRW has called on the Israeli military to halt the forcible displacement of Palestinian civilians throughout occupied Palestinian territory, and allow all the residents of Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams to return to their homes.\n\nFor tens of thousands of displaced people, the future remains uncertain.\n\nNehaya al-Jundi's family eventually found refuge in a nearby village. But with their lives turned upside down and most of their possessions now out of reach, back in the camp, it's been a hard year.\n\n\"Everything has been difficult since we left,\" she says.\n\nNur Shams' tight-knit community has been scattered across the Tulkarm area. Some are living with relatives, others in rented accommodation.\n\nMany are out of work, dependent on modest handouts from the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority and various NGOs.\n\nWith schools run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) also out of action in the camps, education has also been severely impacted.\n\n\"My kids were enrolled in UNRWA schools,\" says Nidal Abu Nase, whose family has been living with relatives since January.\n\n\"They went for months without school.\"\n\nCrucially, the camps' strong communal bonds have been fractured.\n\nThe residents of West Bank refugee camps are mostly descended from Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948-49.\n\n\"For me, the camp is identity and culture,\" Nidal says.\n\n\"There was love and affection in the camp,\" Nehaya says, \"but not anymore because we are far from each other.\"\n\nNehaya has not seen her house since February. Despite recent protests, very few residents have been allowed back into the camps.\n\nThe community centre where she ran rehabilitation services for the disabled has been turned into an Israeli military barracks.\n\nAnd reports from young men who have managed to sneak into Nur Shams suggest that Nehaya's house is no longer habitable.\n\n\"They told me the house is wide open - and fully destroyed.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Alaa Badarneh"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmxmxljg8mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:13:33.722+00:00","title":"Miss Universe: Mexico's Fatima Bosch, who walked out on organisers, wins pageant","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Miss Mexico Fatima Bosch won the Miss Universe 2025 title in Bangkok after a dramatic walkout at a pre-pageant event where she was publicly berated by Thai organizer Nawat Itsaragrasil.

on organisers, wins pageant\n\nMiss Mexico Fatima Bosch has been crowned Miss Universe at a ceremony in Bangkok, marking the end of an exceptionally scandal-filled pageant season.\n\nThe 25-year-old contestant had walked out of an event earlier in November after a Thai official publicly berated her in front of dozens of contestants and threatened to disqualify those who supported her.\n\nThat dramatic turn was followed a week later by the resignation of two judges, one of whom accused organisers of rigging the competition.\n\nThese come as one of the world's longest-running beauty pageants faces questions of its relevancy and a declining audience.\n\nThe contest's latest result has added to the controversy, with news of Miss Mexico's win instantly dividing opinion online.\n\nMany Mexicans celebrated her victory, as did others who had applauded her walkout.\n\nBut some have also wondered if organisers gave her the crown to make up for the earlier scandal.\n\nMiss Thailand Praveenar Singh placed first runner up while Miss Venezuela Stephany Abasali placed third, followed by Miss Philippines Ma Ahtisa Manalo and Miss Cote d'Ivoire Olivia Yace.\n\nThings took a dramatic turn at a pre-pageant ceremony early this month, when Thai media mogul and pageant organiser  Mr Nawat Itsaragrasil told off Ms Bosch  in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.\n\nWhen she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity, in a move that made headlines around the world.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization condemned Mr Nawat's behaviour as \"malicious\" and Mr Rocha, speaking by video from Mexico, told his Thai business partner to just \"stop\".\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum praised Ms Bosch at that time as an \"example of how we women should speak out\" in the face of aggression.\n\nDuring Friday's finals, Mr Nawat posted photos from the audience on his Instagram stories but he was not seen on stage.\n\nAfter Ms Bosch's crowning, he posted a one-line statement in Thai on his social media accounts, saying: \"A billion words that cannot be said\".\n\nHe also told reporters: \"As for the outcome, we leave it to the viewers at home to judge... people everywhere can make their own assessment.\"\n\nOn social media, some fans said the backstage drama helped Ms Bosch clinch the crown, which is Mexico's fourth.\n\n\"Next year, whoever walks out will win,\" one comment read, while another said: \"They had to crown her to make up for injustice earlier to save Miss Universe!\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted the Miss Universe Organization for comment.\n\nOn its social media accounts, the organisation praised Ms Bosch, saying \"her grace, strength, and radiant spirit captured the hearts of the world\".\n\nA week after the walkout controversy,  two judges resigned  with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.\n\nLebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the final on Friday.\n\nHours later, former French football star Claude Makelele also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization rejected Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\".\n\nOn Friday, minutes after Ms Bosch's win was announced, Mr Harfouch posted a statement online repeating his allegations of rigging.\n\nIn a separate incident, during the preliminary evening gown round on Wednesday night, Miss Jamaica accidentally fell onstage and had to be rushed out of the theatre in a stretcher.\n\nClips of the incident were shared widely on social media. Organisers later said she was hospitalised but had no broken bones and was \"under good care\".\n\nThe recent controversies, analysts say, underscore the cultural and strategic differences between Miss Universe's Thai and Mexican owners.\n\nThe pageant events are being organised by Mr Nawat, who is known to fans as the founder and owner of Miss Grand International, a smaller Thai-based contest that is known for its loud social media presence.\n\nMr Nawat holds the licence to host this year's Miss Universe pageant, while the Miss Universe Organization is being run out of Mexico by businessman Raul Rocha.\n\nIt is a relatively new leadership, brought in just before the pageant began.\n\nThai transgender media mogul Anne Jakrajutatip had previously owned the event, having acquired the pageant from US entertainment company Endeavor in 2022. She made sweeping changes towards inclusivity, allowing transgender women, married women and women with children to participate. She also scrapped the age cap for contestants.\n\nAs audiences declined over the years, she sought to monetise the Miss Universe brand, stamping it on merchandise such as bottled water and bags.\n\nIn 2023,  her entertainment company JKN, filed for bankruptcy, citing \"liquidity problems\" .\n\nShe resigned as CEO of JKN just before this year's pre-pageant events and was replaced by Guatemalan diplomat Mario Bucaro.\n\nBefore she resigned, Ms Jakrajutatip brought in Mr Rocha from Mexico as business partner and later tapped Mr Nawat to organise the 2025 pageant.\n\nIt has been a \"very rocky transition\" for the pageant's leadership, Dani Walker, an American beauty queen and pageant coach told the BBC. She said important roles were now split between leaders in Bangkok and Mexico.\n\nThe leadership structure was much clearer when the pageant was being run by Endeavor, and before that, Donald Trump, she said.\n\n\"For fans and outsiders, it's very confusing. No one knows who the real leaders are or who to ask when they have questions, and that's very damaging to the brand,\" Paula Shugart, who served as Miss Universe Organization president under the previous two owners, told the BBC.\n\nThitiphong Duangkhong, a scholar of women's and Latin American studies and an expert on beauty pageants, said those behind the pageant should be aware of their cultural differences.\n\n\"In our country, we use the Thai language to communicate with our fellow Thais. We understand the social context, we understand social structure, we understand the inequality of power in society, and we constantly try to negotiate with it using the Thai language,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMr Thitiphong said Ms Jakrajutatip being a transwoman might not have sat well with some Latin American fans who subscribe to macho culture.\n\n\"There's talk of women who aren't women suddenly buying a pageant that's supposed to be about women's entertainment. What's going to happen?\"\n\nThe crowning of the new Miss Universe, the 74th since 1952, signals the resolve of an organisation to stay relevant and evolve from a once-a-year television spectacle to a media brand that is ready for TikTok.\n\nFor years, audiences for the Miss Universe broadcast have been declining steadily as fans shift to social media.\n\nOn TikTok and Instagram, former titleholders, even runners up, now maintain accounts with millions of followers, transforming them into influencers.\n\nIt is in this e-commerce universe that Mr Nawat's Miss Grand International queens are expected to embrace - selling merchandise in live broadcasts - which he tried to introduce to Miss Universe.\n\nBut on the Latin American side, beauty queens are still regarded as glamorous television celebrities.\n\nA Miss Universe reality show was even staged for that audience and the winner - a Dominican crowned Miss Universe Latina - competed in the main pageant in Bangkok.\n\nThe contest still remains very popular in Latin America and South East Asia, where pageant crowns have become a way out of poverty or an express pass for girls dreaming of becoming a celebrity.\n\nBut it has continued to face questions of its relevancy and constant criticism that it sexually objectifies women.\n\nOrganisers have made accommodations in recent years. While the majority of contestants wore two piece bikinis for the 2025 contest's swimsuit round, those from conservative countries were allowed to wear full-body coverings.\n\n\"Of course, it won't be for everyone, and there will always be those who disagree. But as long as the core values ​​are intact, I think pageants will always have a role to play in society,\" said Ms Shugart, the former president.\n\nShe said empowering women should be at the organisation's core.\n\n\"Miss Universe is nothing if you're not empowering the women that compete.\"\n\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

\"peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".\n\nShe has long denounced President Nicolás Maduro's government as \"criminal\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. Many nations view his rule as illegitimate.\n\nMachado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.\n\nThe elections were  widely dismissed on the international stage  as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.\n\nDespite her barring, Machado was able to unite Venezuela's opposition behind her little-known surrogate on the ballot, Edmundo González.\n\nThe government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide.\n\nGonzález later  fled to Spain , fearing repression. This was followed by attempts to  detain other opposition officials .\n\nThe Nobel Committee, when announcing the recipient of the prize at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo,  hailed Machado  as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".\n\nNobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said at the time he hoped Machado would be able to attend an award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December, but acknowledged the serious security situation she faced.\n\nMachado expressed shock at winning the prize, saying: \"I am just one person.

key to peace with Ukraine?\n\nKirill Dmitriev is a rare breed of Russian diplomat.\n\nAt 50 he is relatively young and he has a deep understanding of the US, having studied and worked there for several years.\n\nHe is also a man of commerce, as head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and a good fit for his opposite number in the Trump administration, special envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nDmitriev now finds himself under the spotlight over a draft peace plan that emerged after he spent three days with Witkoff in Miami.\n\nHis team has refused to comment on its proposals, which read like a Putin wishlist, requiring Ukraine to cede territory under its control and slash the size of its military.\n\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to reject its terms, but says any deal must bring a \"dignified peace, with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty\".\n\nPutin's special envoy understands modern Ukraine better than most in Moscow. He was brought up in Ukraine, and a friend claims that as a 15-year-old Dmitriev took part in pro-democracy protests in Kyiv before the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe has been a fixture of US-Russian diplomatic initiatives pretty much since the start of Trump's second presidency - and Steve Witkoff has been a regular counterpart.\n\n\"We are sure we are on the road to peace, and as peacemakers we need to make it happen,\" Dmitriev told a conference in Saudi Arabia in late October.\n\nThe pair appear to have first crossed paths in February 2025 when Putin's envoy played a role in securing the release of an American teacher from a Russian jail.\n\n\"There's a gentleman from Russia, his name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.\n\nDays later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.\n\nDmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off.\n\nWhen Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.\n\nUnlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio. He is careful to praise Trump's diplomatic skills while giving Western viewers the Russian government narrative in their own language.\n\n\"I'm not a military guy… but the position of [the] Russian military is they only hit military targets,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper recently, days after a kindergarten was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \"I'm just working to have dialogue and make sure that the conflict is ended as soon as possible.\"\n\nDmitriev certainly is not a military guy, he's a private investment specialist with an eye for a deal.\n\nWitkoff may rate him, but in 2022 during Joe Biden's presidency,  the US Treasury called him a \"known Putin ally\"   and imposed sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which he has run since 2011.\n\n\"While officially a sovereign wealth fund, RDIF is widely considered a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and is emblematic of Russia's broader kleptocracy,\" it said.\n\nDmitriev's attitude to the Biden years is pretty clear: under Biden there was no attempt to understand the Russian position, he argues, while Trump's team stopped World War Three.\n\nIt is claimed that Dmitriev has accumulated a real estate fortune with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.\n\nPopova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.\n\nHis rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.\n\nThat scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.\n\nDmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.\n\nWhile Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.\n\nHis relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"\n\nHe later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".\n\nAfter earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.\n\nDmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.\n\nBy 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nIncreasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.\n\nHe was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.\n\nHis overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.\n\nThe Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.\n\nMuch of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity.\n\nHe proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.\n\nHe has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.\n\nDmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where  sanctions have been imposed on him  for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5n8x1vedo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:09:18.990+00:00","title":"BBC board member resigns and criticises 'governance issues' at top of corporation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A BBC board member, Shumeet Banerji, has resigned, citing governance issues and a lack of consultation regarding the departures of director general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness.

We fight like hell.\"\n\nIn the Panorama programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, the edited clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nTrump has threatened to sue over the programme , saying it defamed him. While the BBC has apologised, it has refused the president's demand for financial compensation.\n\nIn his role on the board, Banerji was \"responsible for upholding and protecting the independence of the BBC by acting in the public interest and exercising independent judgement\", according to the corporation's website.\n\nBanerji, a non-executive board member since 2022, is the founder of an advisory and investment firm that specialises in technology companies.

This is the US Special Operations Command mothership which can serve as a base for 200 troops and has hangar bays for several helicopters.\n\nThe US has also deployed  F-35 fighter jets to its bases in the Caribbean , and has flown bombers and spy planes over the region.\n\nBBC Verify used flight tracking data to identify four US military aircraft flying near Venezuela on 20 and 21 November.\n\nA US B-52 long-range bomber briefly appeared on flight tracking website Flightradar24 off Guyana - Venezuela's eastern neighbour - at around 23:45 GMT (19:45 local time) on 20 November.\n\nThe data shows the bomber - call sign TIMEX11 - departed from the US state of North Dakota that afternoon and landed back there the following morning.\n\nA US Air Force surveillance aircraft - call sign ALBUS39 - appeared on flight-tracking data just after 22:00 GMT (18:00 local time) on 20 November, flying for about two hours near the eastern coast of Venezuela.\n\nAround a similar time a US Navy Super Hornet fighter jet - call sign FELIX11 - was seen circling off the western coast.\n\nAnd a US Air Force refuelling tanker - call sign PYRO33 - was also over the southern Caribbean around 01:30 GMT (21:30 local time) on 21 November. It then stopped broadcasting its location until it was later seen heading north-west.\n\nIn October, three B-52 bombers took off from an airbase in Louisiana and circled off the coast of Venezuela before returning, according to flight tracking data from FlightRadar24.\n\nAnd last month tracking data shows several P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircrafts flew south over the Caribbean from a US naval base in Florida.\n\nExperts say these flights suggest the US is trying to gather military intelligence from the region.\n\n\"We see activity by P-8As around the world anywhere the US Navy has an interest in boosting its marine domain awareness,\" says Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nUS President Donald Trump has also acknowledged that he authorised the  CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that might mean remains highly classified.\n\nThe build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\n\"The level of forces, and the fact that they are plainly not tailored for the purpose of pure drug interdiction has raised suspicions the US may be heading towards war with Venezuela,\" says Mr Ziemer.\n\n\"The escalation risks are significant, but I think that within the Trump Administration there is still considerable debate over what will come next,\" he adds.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, Trump told CBS' 60 Minutes on 3 November: \"I doubt it… But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response in November they declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\n\"Overall, I believe the pace of strikes against targets at sea will increase in the near future, while the United States tries to make up its mind about whether it can strike inside Venezuela,\" says Mr Ziemer.\n\nBetween 2 September and 19 November, US forces hit at least 22 vessels in 21 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nUS Southern Command  announced that its latest strike , conducted on Saturday in eastern Pacific international waters, killed three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board.\n\nCollectively, at least 83 people have been killed, according to statements from US officials.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified the people killed, they have alleged they were all \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nAn  investigation from the Associated Press reported  that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nTrump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to the US.\n\nIn a statement, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which has been officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nIn some cases, US officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nBut some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Edgington and Bernd Debusmann Jr. Graphics by Leo Scutt-Richter."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j8j48e5z2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"02:38:18.697+00:00","title":"Cuter and closer: Raccoons may be on their way to becoming America's next pet","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in Frontiers in Zoology reveals that raccoons in urban areas are evolving to appear more domesticated, with a noticeable reduction in snout length compared to rural raccoons.

groups that have emerged to fight Hamas in Gaza over recent months.\n\nThey include groups based around family clans, criminal gangs and new militia – some of which are backed by Israel, as its prime minister recently admitted.\n\nElements within the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank and is a political rival to Hamas - are also believed to be covertly sending support.\n\nBut these militia - each operating in its own local area inside the 53% of Gaza's territory currently controlled by Israeli forces - have not been officially included in US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for an International Stabilisation Force and a newly-trained Palestinian police force to secure Gaza in the next stage of the deal.\n\nOne of the largest militia is headed by Yasser Abu Shabab, whose Popular Forces operate near the southern city of Rafah.\n\nIn one recent social media video, his deputy talks about working in co-ordination with the Board of Peace - the international body to be tasked with running Gaza under the plan.\n\nHossam al-Astal, who leads a militia called the Counter-Terrorism Strike Force near the southern city of Khan Younis, told Israeli media this week that \"US representatives\" had confirmed his group would have a role in Gaza's future police force.\n\nA US official said they had nothing to announce at this time.\n\nEarlier this month, Astal grinned when I asked if he had spoken to the Americans about the future, and told me he would share the details soon.\n\nI asked if those conversations left him happy.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, with a big smile.\n\nHossam al-Astal once worked for the Palestinian Authority. His group is small - maybe tens of fighters - but is increasingly confident, and runs a well-supplied tent city near Khan Younis.\n\n\"Let's say it's not the right time for me to answer this question,\" Astal smiled when I asked if Israel was supplying him.  \"But we co-ordinate with the Israeli side to bring in food, weapons, everything.\"\n\nI asked how he paid for them.\n\n\"People all over the world are supporting us,\" he replied. \"It's not all from Israel. They claim Israel is the only one supporting us and that we are agents of Israel. We are not Israel's agents.\"\n\nHe told me tens of families had come to live in his new site, just inside the Yellow Line that marks the territory currently controlled by Israel under the ceasefire deal - and that more people were arriving every week.\n\n\"We are the next day for the new Gaza,\" he told me. \"We have no problem co-operating with the Palestinian Authority, with the Americans, with anyone who aligns with us. We are the alternative to Hamas.\"\n\nBut many Gazans - including those disillusioned with Hamas - are unhappy with the new power given to these small and fragmented armed groups.\n\n\"Only a small number of men who have no religion, faith, or ethics have joined these criminals,\" said Saleh Sweidan, who is currently living in Gaza City.  \"Gaza's government was ruling us, and although there were many burdens on civilians, any government is better than gangs.\"\n\n\"These groups that co-operate with the occupation [Israel] are the worst thing that the war has produced,\" said Zaher Doulah, another Gaza City resident. \"Joining them is not only dangerous, it is a great betrayal.\"\n\nThirty-one year old Montaser Masoud told me he had joined al-Astal's new tent city two months ago with his wife and four children, crossing the Yellow Line at night to avoid Hamas, and after coordination with Israeli forces.\n\nBut he said relatives who had stayed behind in Hamas-controlled areas were critical of the move.\n\n\"They've been harassing us, saying what we're doing it wrong and has no future,\" he told me. \"I tell them that they're the ones we worry about, because they live outside the Yellow Line and anyone from Hamas could hide next to them, and they could be bombed.\"\n\nAs we spoke by phone, the sound of heavy gunfire around him repeatedly punctured our conversation.\n\n\"It's the [Israeli] army nearby,\" he explained. \"But it's not a problem because we know we're not the target.\"\n\nSeveral armed groups are now ranged against Hamas, with complex and overlapping ties.\n\nAbu Shabab's group, for example, is accused of looting aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, and reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).\n\n\"What's wrong with it?\" Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last month in response to the news that his country had secretly backed militia groups.  \"It's a good thing. It saves soldiers' lives.\"\n\nDisclosing the information, he said, had \"only helped Hamas\".\n\nNetanyahu has insisted Gaza will not be run by either Hamas or its rival, the Palestinian Authority. Under the US peace plan, a non-political, technocratic committee of Palestinians will run Gaza in the short term under international oversight, until the PA reforms are complete.\n\nBut a senior Palestinian official has rejected Astal's claims that his fighters will form part of the future police force there.\n\nMaj-Gen Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority's security forces, told the BBC that there could be no blanket integration of men from Gaza's armed groups, some of which are backed by Israel.\n\n\"Israel might demand the integration of these militia, due to Israel's own specific political and security considerations,\" he said in an interview in the West Bank city of Ramallah.  \"But Israel's demands don't necessarily benefit the Palestinians. Israel wants to continue imposing its control in one way or another in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThe question of what will happen to Gaza's new militia under a durable peace still remains unanswered.\n\nIsrael's decision to back the enemies of their enemy in Gaza is a sign they have not learned from history, according to Michael Milshtein, formerly the head of Palestinian affairs for Israel's military intelligence.\n\n\"This is the same risk the Americans took in Afghanistan 30 years ago,\" he said. \"They supported the Taliban against the Soviets, then the Taliban took the weapons they got from the Americans and used them against the Americans.\"\n\nHe said Israel was now relying on groups with dubious pasts in the hope they would provide a political social and ideological alternative to Hamas.\n\n\"There will be a moment when they will turn their rifles – the rifles they got from Israel – against the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces],\" he said.\n\nAside from helping to weaken Hamas, Israel's support for armed groups could make it easier to divide Palestinian opposition to Israel, and maintain influence inside Gaza once its forces withdraw.\n\nSome critics say that arming disparate local groups will make it harder to persuade Hamas to disarm, and for international forces to step into the role of securing Gaza.\n\nBut the risk for Israel is that the same groups it is helping to arm will one day become the new enemy it faces.\n\nForty years ago, it encouraged a hardline Islamist organisation in Gaza to offset the growing power of Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.\n\nThat organisation became Hamas.\n\nAdditional reporting by Naomi Scherbel-Ball, Samantha Granville and the Gaza freelance team"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p783g2j5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:52:15.432+00:00","title":"Scientists reveal what triggered Santorini 'earthquake swarm'","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A swarm of over 25,000 earthquakes near the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in early 2025 was caused by horizontal movement of magma through a 30km underground channel beneath the seafloor.

triggered Santorini 'earthquake swarm'\n\nThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.\n\nThey used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust.\n\nThey used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.\n\nOne of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.\n\nMany tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.\n\nThe scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.\n\nThe team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor.\n\nThe researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors.\n\nLead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\n\n\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"\n\nFor now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\n\n\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"\n\nVolcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.\n\nAnd these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\n\n\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\"."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/trump-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:51:24.695Z","title":"Trump and Prince Had ‘Disturbing’ Call After Khashoggi’s Murder, Lawmaker Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Representative Eugene Vindman, a Democrat from Virginia and former National Security Council official, has called for the declassification of a 2019 phone call between President Donald Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, describing it as 'highly disturbing' and potentially revealing a cover-up related to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

2025-11-21T18:51:24.695Z\n\nRepresentative Eugene Vindman, Democrat of Virginia, called on Friday for the declassification of what he described as a “highly disturbing” 2019 phone call between President Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAt a news conference on Capitol Hill with Mr. Khashoggi’s widow, Mr. Vindman said that the transcript, which he reviewed as part of his duties serving on the National Security Council during Mr. Trump's first term, “would shock people if they knew what was said.”\n\nHe said it was one of two disturbing phone call transcripts he had read during his time in the first Trump administration, the other being the 2019 call with Ukraine’s president that became the basis of a whistle-blower complaint by his twin brother, Alexander Vindman, that led to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment.\n\nMr. Vindman did not divulge what was said in the call between Mr. Trump and Prince Mohammed, who U.S. intelligence concluded approved the killing. But in a letter to Mr. Trump on Thursday, he and dozens of other House Democrats demanded its release. That push is exceedingly unlikely to succeed, and the Virginia Democrat’s announcement appeared calculated mostly to intensify political pressure on the president and keep attention on the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.\n\nStill, in an interview, Mr. Vindman said he had been moved to speak out after Mr. Trump welcomed Prince Mohammed to the White House this week, saying the president “tried to completely rewrite history” about the Saudi leader’s role in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist.\n\nDuring the meeting, held in the Oval Office on Tuesday, as a reporter attempted to ask the crown prince about his involvement in the brutal slaying of Mr. Khashoggi, Mr. Trump interjected to say “things happen,” and asserting that Prince Mohammed “knew nothing about it.”\n\n“You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Khashoggi. “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him, or didn’t like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.”\n\nMr. Vindman took issue with the president’s characterization saying that “U.S. intelligence assessed that M.B.S. ordered the capture and kill,” referring to the C.I.A. conclusion that the crown prince directed the killing.\n\n“There is no justification to kidnap him, torture him, and to kill him and to cut him to pieces. This is a terrorist act,” Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, Mr. Khashoggi’s widow, said during the news conference on Friday, where she also pushed back against the president’s characterization of her late husband.\n\n“I would like to tell Mr. Trump, you’re expressing someone else, not Jamal Khashoggi,” she said. “Jamal Khashoggi was a most stable man. He was a role model to represent the Arab and Muslim, and he accepted everybody regarding your ideology background as well.”\n\nThe transcripts of calls between presidents and foreign leaders are controlled by the White House, and usually covered by executive privilege. Veterans of the first Trump administration feel burned over the release of what Mr. Trump came to call his “perfect call” with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump has in the past threatened lawmakers with investigations for divulging classified material, members of Congress have wide latitude to speak their minds, protected by the “speech and debate” clause of the Constitution.\n\nMr. Vindman first made his demand that the call be released on the floor of the House, where his comments have deep constitutional protections. While that clause does not necessarily allow lawmakers to release classified material, Mr. Vindman was careful not to talk about specific details of what was in the call, only to share his characterization that it had been shocking.\n\nMr. Vindman said releasing the transcript would expose what he views as years of conflicts of interest and corruption in Mr. Trump’s dealings with the Saudis. He cited the president’s own comments to the journalist Bob Woodward regarding Prince Mohammed that the president had “saved his ass” following the Khashoggi killing.\n\n“The American people deserve transparency, and the Khashoggi family deserves closure,” Mr. Vindman said in an interview. “The president needs to come clean.”\n\nAsked why he had not demanded the transcript’s release sooner, Mr. Vindman said the political context has fundamentally shifted.\n\n“Up to this point, M.B.S. was a pariah,” he said. “Now the president is trying to whitewash everything. The benefits the Trump family reaped would become much clearer if that transcript were released.”\n\nJulian Barnes contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:09:08.794+00:00","title":"Australia's social media ban for kids under 16 - how will it work?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has enacted a world-first ban on children under 16 from creating or using accounts on major social media platforms, effective from 10 December 2025, in response to rising concerns about mental health risks, harmful content, and cyberbullying.

This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.\n\nOne in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.\n\nThe Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.\n\nIt is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord  have recently introduced age checks  on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban.\n\nThe government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.\n\nThese comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.\n\nYouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.\n\nChildren and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.\n\nThe government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.\n\nSeveral possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.\n\nThe government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads,  has announced  it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said.\n\nThe other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.\n\nWithout a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.\n\nThe government's  own report  found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.\n\nQuestions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".\n\nCritics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently  made headlines  for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.\n\nOthers point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.\n\nCommunications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\".\n\n\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"\n\nCritics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages.\n\nAustralia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.\n\nBut the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches.\n\nIt also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.\n\nSocial media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy.\n\nThey also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies.\n\nYouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nEven as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\".\n\nAt parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it.\n\nKick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.\n\nThe ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.\n\nIn the UK,  new safety rules  introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.\n\nOther European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a  French parliamentary enquiry  recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.\n\nDenmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.\n\nMeanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.\n\nTeens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.\n\nOnline, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.\n\nSome teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents.

Sent to Prison for Taking Pro-Russia Bribes\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T11:50:02-05:00\n\nA former politician in Nigel Farage’s Reform U.K. party was sentenced on Friday to 10 and a half years in prison for taking bribes to make pro-Russia statements in the European Parliament.\n\nNathan Gill, 52, admitted to being paid between 2018 and 2020 to make speeches and media appearances that were scripted by Oleg Voloshyn, a Ukrainian politician who had been an official in the Kremlin-backed government of Viktor Yanukovych. Mr. Voloshyn was a member of a pro-Russian political party at the time of the offenses.\n\nSanctions were imposed on Mr. Voloshyn by the United States and Britain in 2022. The British accused him of “spreading disinformation and pro-Russian narratives which support Russia’s actions in Ukraine.”\n\nWhatsApp messages that were presented in court showed that Mr. Voloshyn ordered Mr. Gill to find other Brussels lawmakers to take on some tasks, including appearing on a pro-Russian television channel, 112 Ukraine, which was later banned from broadcasting in Ukraine.\n\nCmdr. Dominic Murphy of Britain’s Metropolitan Police said at a news briefing on Thursday that his team were investigating several former British lawmakers in the European Parliament who had been asked by Mr. Gill to raise parliamentary questions, make speeches or appear in the media at the behest of Mr. Voloshyn.\n\nCommander Murphy said he could not name the ex-politicians but that several had attended voluntary interviews. “It is an ongoing investigation, and we will continue to follow that investigation wherever it goes,” he said.\n\nThe police believe that several other Brussels lawmakers may have been instructed directly by Mr. Voloshyn. A joint investigation team has been started involving the Metropolitan Police and forces from the countries those lawmakers represented in the European Parliament, Commander Murphy said.\n\nHe said that Mr. Farage, who also had led the right-wing U.K. Independence Party and the Brexit Party, and represented them in the European Parliament, was not among the politicians under investigation. Mr. Gill later became the leader of Reform U.K. in Wales, but left in May 2021 after failing to be elected to the Welsh parliament.\n\nSpeaking at Friday’s sentencing, Peter Wright, Mr. Gill’s defense lawyer, said that Mr. Farage was “never the subject of any proposition nor indeed of any agreement” relating to Mr. Gill’s pro-Russian activities.\n\nProsecutors said that Mr. Gill was paid at least £30,000, or about $40,000, for the eight instances of bribery he admitted, which related to two scripted speeches to the European Parliament and appearances on 112 Ukraine.\n\nIn several of the television appearances, Mr. Gill expressed support for Viktor Medvedchuk, a former Ukrainian politician who is close to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and now lives in Russia. Mr. Gill was paid to arrange and host a July 2019 presentation by Mr. Medvedchuk inside the European Parliament, prosecutors said.\n\nThe following day, Mr. Medvedchuk met with Mr. Putin in Russia, and hailed the European Parliament meeting as a success. An English transcript published by the Kremlin quoted Mr. Putin as saying the event was “very positive.”\n\nMr. Gill served in the European Parliament for UKIP between 2014 and 2018, when he joined Mr. Farage’s Brexit Party, and held his seat until the United Kingdom left the European Union on Jan. 31, 2020.\n\nThe police began their investigation in September 2021 after the F.B.I. alerted British authorities to evidence arising from a stop of Mr. Voloshyn at Washington’s Dulles Airport in July 2021 in which his phone was seized.\n\nMr. Gill was stopped at Manchester Airport on Sept. 31, 2021. He told the police he was traveling to Russia to “act as an observer” for elections to the Duma, Commander Murphy said.\n\nBritain’s security minister, Dan Jarvis, said in a statement Friday that Mr. Gill had used his position “to advance the malign interests of Russia over those of the U.K. in exchange for money,” and accused him “a betrayal of our country, our people, and our national security.”\n\nThe case comes amid heightened concerns over Russian sabotage and espionage in Britain, following the imprisonment of a group who set fire to a Ukrainian-owned London warehouse on the orders of Russian intelligence, and a network paid to spy on journalists and critics of the Russian government.\n\nThe defense lawyer, Mr. Wright, said that Mr. Gill had come into contact with Mr. Voloshyn after receiving a “round robin email” sent to multiple lawmakers inviting them to attend World War II commemorations in Ukraine in May 2018. There, he met local opposition politicians who gave him a “different” perspective on the ongoing conflict with pro-Russian separatists.\n\nMr. Wright said Mr. Gill felt “deep shame” about his conduct, but the police said he had refused to answer any questions when interviewed.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/cassidy-cdc-vaccines-autism.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:05:41.908Z","title":"Cassidy Got Pledges From Kennedy on Vaccines.

They Haven’t Stuck.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T19:05:41.908Z\n\nThe move by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week to walk back an assertion on its website that vaccines do not cause autism has spotlighted how Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s personal skepticism about vaccines is now shaping the nation’s public health policy.\n\nIt has also raised more questions about the decisions of key Republican senators who had been wary of confirming Mr. Kennedy to swallow their concerns early this year and support him.\n\nThe leading skeptic was Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a doctor and the chairman of the Senate’s health committee, who agonized over whether to cast the crucial vote to back Mr. Kennedy. He ultimately did so after outlining in a speech on the Senate floor a list of concessions he said he had secured from Mr. Kennedy, all aimed at limiting his ability to impose anti-vaccine views on the agency.\n\nNine months later, some of the most consequential promises that Mr. Cassidy said he had secured from Mr. Kennedy appear to have been breached or broken altogether.\n\nHere’s a look at areas in which Mr. Kennedy appears to have ignored or sidestepped Mr. Cassidy’s demands.\n\nBefore he voted to confirm Mr. Kennedy in February, Mr. Cassidy said that Mr. Kennedy had committed to sharing an “unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship if he is confirmed.” The two agreed to speak or meet a few times a month.\n\nThe men do appear to speak regularly. But they most often disagree, and Mr. Kennedy does not often make concessions to the Senate Health, Education and Labor Committee chairman based on their disagreements. For instance, Mr. Kennedy said he had spoken with Mr. Cassidy before revealing the changes to the C.D.C. website.\n\n“He disagreed with the decision,” Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nIn his floor speech, Mr. Cassidy spoke at length about his worry that the Health and Human Services Department under Mr. Kennedy would withhold access to or sow public fear about vaccines. He said his support was “built on assurances that this will not have to be a concern and that he and I can work together to build an agenda to make America healthy again.” And at his swearing in, Mr. Kennedy said that he would do nothing as health secretary that “makes it difficult or discourages people from taking” vaccines.\n\nBut Mr. Kennedy has canceled $500 million in funding for the development of mRNA vaccines that help prevent diseases like the flu. And he changed the recommendations for who should take the COVID-19 vaccine, narrowing it to seniors and people at high risk.\n\nAt a hearing in September, several Republicans expressed concerns that his decisions as secretary had made it more difficult for Americans to obtain the vaccines they need.\n\n“Effectively, we’re denying people vaccines,” Mr. Cassidy said.\n\n“You’re wrong,” Mr. Kennedy fired back.\n\nBack in February, Mr. Cassidy said he had been assured that Mr. Kennedy “would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.”\n\nHe added: “If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.”\n\nIn June, Mr. Kennedy fired all 17 members of the board and replaced them with eight new members, at least four of whom had been critical of vaccination in the past. (One later stepped down because of financial conflicts of interest.)\n\nIn response, Mr. Cassidy broke with Mr. Kennedy, calling for an indefinite delay in the meeting of the panel, arguing that its members were unqualified to ensure public faith in its recommendations.\n\nThe meeting went ahead, as planned.\n\nIt is rare for a senator to make specific demands about the wording of a federal agency’s website. But Mr. Cassidy purposefully stated for the record a commitment he said Mr. Kennedy had made to him that “C.D.C. will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the C.D.C. website was updated with new text that said, “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”\n\nThe web page still has a headline up stating, “Vaccines do not cause autism,” underneath the new text strongly suggesting that they might. But it includes an asterisk and a footnote that explains the statement is only there because technically the agency would be in violation of an agreement with Mr. Cassidy if it were removed.\n\nMr. Cassidy has been using his social media channels to push back, stating that “vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism.”\n\nIf the secretary has sought input from Mr. Cassidy in making hiring decisions, he has not appeared to have given it much weight.\n\nMr. Kennedy has not only brought in advisers who are critical of vaccination but he has fired top officials who disagree with his worldview.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the C.D.C., said in September that she was fired from the post “for holding the line on scientific integrity.” In testimony before the Senate Health Committee, Dr. Monarez said that Mr. Kennedy had requested that she fire top C.D.C. officials responsible for vaccine policy and accept the recommendations of his handpicked advisers, or resign.\n\n(Mr. Kennedy claimed that he had fired her for refusing to say she was “trustworthy.”)\n\nMs. Monarez called Mr. Cassidy after the conversation in question to warn him that she might not be around much longer. It is not clear whether the senator tried to intercede on her behalf, but she was fired by the White House two days later.\n\nSheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/americas/us-navy-venezuela-satellite-data.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:05:59-05:00","title":"Satellite Data Reveals How the U.S. Navy Is Deployed Near Venezuela","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Satellite imagery analysis reveals that the U.S. Navy has been systematically positioning warships 50 to 100 miles off Venezuela’s coast since early September 2025, far from the primary drug smuggling routes off Colombia.

Satellite Data Reveals How the U.S. Navy Is Deployed Near Venezuela\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T10:05:59-05:00\n\nThe U.S. Navy has routinely been positioning warships near Venezuela’s coast in locations far from the Caribbean’s main drug-smuggling routes, suggesting that the buildup is focused more on a pressure campaign against Venezuela than on the counternarcotics operation the Trump administration says it’s waging.\n\nCruisers and destroyers have consistently been sailing in an area 50 to 100 miles off Venezuelan shores, according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to and verified by The New York Times. Though some cocaine is trafficked in this area, it is several hundred miles east of the busiest smuggling routes, which, according to U.S. government data, are off the coast of neighboring Colombia.\n\nThe vessels are part of the largest U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, a show of force that has included a series of heavy bomber aircraft flying along Venezuela’s coast.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has highly publicized its military activities in the region and touted its airstrikes on suspected smuggling boats, the locations of naval assets have largely been kept secret. The satellite data pinpoints nearly 100 positions of at least eight vessels over the past two and a half months, as they traversed the Caribbean Sea.\n\nSources: Vessel detections by Ollie Ballinger using satellite images by Copernicus via Sentinel Hub.\n\nBy Lazaro Gamio\n\nSome warships are equipped with powerful surveillance radars to identify surface and aerial targets, and are loaded with long-range missiles capable of striking deep within Venezuela.\n\n“The naval presence that we’re seeing here is aimed at Venezuela, and they can see it,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe United States has said its military forces are in the region to stop the flow of illicit drugs, while accusing Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, of playing a key role in their exportation to the United States. At least 83 people have been killed in 21 known strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific that U.S. officials said were transporting drugs.\n\nThe U.S. government has not provided any evidence that the targeted boats were carrying drugs, and many legal experts argue that they were not legitimate military targets — and that the strikes may violate international law.\n\nAt the same time, aides to President Trump have been working to oust President Maduro from power, and Mr. Trump has signed off on C.I.A. plans for covert measures inside Venezuela.\n\n“If the goal is to use the drug war, the drug justification, as a Trojan horse to put pressure on Venezuela, then that would point to that,” Adam Isacson, a defense expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, said, referring to the ships’ positions.\n\nIn the past week, U.S. Navy vessels have been spotted sailing closer to Venezuela than has been seen since the start of the buildup. On Tuesday, a destroyer and a large amphibious vessel sailed through the gulf that separates Trinidad and Venezuela, a mere seven miles from Venezuela’s territorial waters. The moves were first reported by ABC News.\n\n“U.S. naval forces conduct operations in international waters following international law, focusing on counternarcotics efforts with regional partners,” a U.S. Southern Command spokesperson told The Times. “We will not comment on or disclose details of specific operations or routes.”\n\nTo track the U.S. Navy ships, Ollie Ballinger, a lecturer in geocomputation at University College London’s Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis, wrote a computer program that can search for specific vessels in free, publicly available satellite images.\n\nNote: Some images contain more than one ship.\n\nSource: Satellite images by Copernicus via Sentinel Hub.\n\nBy Lazaro Gamio\n\nMr. Ballinger provided his findings to The Times, which were then manually corroborated by comparing the vessels found in satellite imagery to verified known photographs of those ships and their specifications, such as dimensions and colors.\n\nWhile there were nearly 100 verified detections of U.S. Navy ships from early September through mid-November, the data itself is incomplete. There were no detections on cloudy days or when satellites weren’t positioned over the Caribbean, for example. The Times verified additional vessel locations that were first identified by several online researchers who also track naval activity.\n\nEven as the Navy appears to intensify its intimidation campaign, The Times found that some ships included in the analysis had also traversed a corridor between Venezuela and the Dominican Republic known for drug smuggling. Navy vessels were spotted in this area at least eight times, the satellite data shows. For traffickers, “that’s a pretty typical route,” said Corey Ranslem, the head of the maritime risk management firm Dryad Global and a Coast Guard veteran who served on counternarcotics missions in the region.\n\nIn any case, smuggling routes in the Caribbean are dwarfed by those in the eastern Pacific, which has not seen a comparable influx of American military assets.\n\nNot all the ships Mr. Ballinger and The Times located were positioned near Venezuela or along less trafficked smuggling routes. Other vessels, including three large amphibious ships carrying thousands of U.S. Marines, have rarely strayed far from the coast of Puerto Rico. These ships, said Mr. Cancian, the military expert, “have essentially zero capability” against drug trafficking.\n\nThey are, however, ideal for landing troops ashore. Over the last three months, Marines on these vessels have carried out mock landing operations on Puerto Rico’s beaches, according to photos and videos the Department of Defense released. Mr. Cancian said the vessels and the troops onboard were insufficient to mount an invasion of Venezuela, but, on Monday, Mr. Trump did not rule out sending U.S. ground forces there.\n\nThose vessels were recently joined by the Navy’s largest and most modern aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, which entered the Caribbean Sea on Sunday.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/business/fed-interest-rates-inflation-jobs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:10:41-05:00","title":"Top Fed Official Boosts Odds of a December Rate Cut","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Top Federal Reserve official John C.

Williams is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a close ally of Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair. He emphasized in a speech that he was more concerned about the labor market weakening than that rising inflation because of President Trump’s tariffs would morph into a more persistent problem.\n\n“My assessment is that the downside risks to employment have increased as the labor market has cooled, while the upside risks to inflation have lessened somewhat,” he said at an event in Santiago, Chile. “Underlying inflation continues to trend downward, absent any evidence of second-round effects emanating from tariffs.”\n\nMr. Williams affirmed that he still believes interest rates, which are in a range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent, are still “restrictive,” meaning they are weighing on economic activity. After two quarter-point cuts at the September and October meetings, the degree of restraint had lessened, but he said he still believed the Fed had room to reduce interest rates further to get to a “neutral” stance that neither revs up nor slows down growth.\n\n“I still see room for a further adjustment in the near term to the target range for the federal funds rate to move the stance of policy closer to the range of neutral,” he said.\n\nHis comments raised the odds that the Fed will follow through with a quarter-point cut when they next meet in December, which would lower interest rates to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent. Traders in federal funds futures markets now see a 65 percent chance of a reduction, up from around 45 percent before the speech.\n\nWhether the Fed lowers rates for a third straight meeting has been subject to intense debate. Policymakers have splintered over the need to provide more relief to the economy while inflation is moving away from the Fed’s 2 percent target and the labor market is slowing.\n\nIn one camp, officials are more concerned about a vulnerable labor market than rising inflation. They include Christopher J. Waller, a Fed governor in the running to replace Mr. Powell as chair when his term ends in May. Stephen I. Miran, the newest member of the Fed’s board of governors, told Bloomberg on Friday that he would support a quarter-point cut rather than the half-point he would prefer if that meant the difference between the Fed cutting or not.\n\nMr. Miran has said that he believes inflation fears are overblown and the economy is at risk of a recession if the central bank does not cut borrowing costs rapidly. He dissented from the consensus and pushed for a half-point cut at each of his two meetings this year, in September and October.\n\nIn the other camp, officials worry that by cutting interest rates further, the Fed could inadvertently stoke price pressures while the labor market is relatively stable.\n\nThe debate has raged in part because there has been limited official data as a result of the longest government shutdown in history. The lapse in funding disrupted the release of crucial economic reports, including the latest labor market and inflation data.\n\nSeptember’s jobs report, released more than a month late on Thursday, did not resolve any differences. It showed stronger-than-expected monthly jobs growth, but the unemployment rate ticked up to a four-year high of 4.4 percent. That is the last jobs report Fed officials will see before they next vote on interest rates.\n\nSusan M. Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said on Friday that holding interest rates steady would be “appropriate for now” because she expects inflation will stay elevated for some time. She will vote at the December meeting.\n\n“If I were seeing evidence that the labor market were notably deteriorating, I would take that very seriously, and that certainly could justify near-term additional easing,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg. “We haven’t seen a significant unemployment change.”\n\nAnother voter, Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, said on Thursday that he was “uneasy” about “front-loading” interest rate cuts.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/europe/trash-britain-illegal-dumping.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:38:01-05:00","title":"A Colossal, Hidden Pile of Trash Ignites Outcry in Britain","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive, hidden pile of trash—approximately 500 feet long and up to four stories tall—was discovered near Kidlington, England, after being concealed behind trees for weeks.

2025-11-21T13:38:01-05:00\n\nIt would almost be majestic, if it weren’t so smelly.\n\nAn enormous wall of trash about 500 feet in length and up to four stories tall was recently discovered near a highway in the English countryside, leading to a national outcry across Britain.\n\nDespite its massive scale, the dump remained hidden from sight for weeks behind a row of trees, leaving many in the country who recently came across images of the heap in disbelief.\n\n“When I was sent the video and pictures, I had to double check and think, is this A.I. or what?” said Liz Gyekye, a spokeswoman for Thames21, an environmental nonprofit. “In terms of the waste tips I’ve seen, this is probably the worst. It’s shocking.”\n\nThe mountain of rubbish near Kidlington, about 60 miles northwest of London, is the latest example of what experts say is a growing problem of criminal organizations profiting from illegal dumping.\n\nAccording to an October report from the House of Lords, “over 38 million tons of waste, enough to fill Wembley Stadium 35 times, is believed to be illegally managed” in the United Kingdom every year, costing around 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion). The House of Lords said that there were currently six similar large-scale dumping sites around the country.\n\nExperts said the issue of illegal dumping, known locally as “fly-tipping,” has worsened in recent years as it has become more expensive to dispose of waste, even as people generate more trash, giving criminal groups a lucrative opportunity.\n\n“These are utterly appalling scenes,” Keir Starmer, the country’s prime minister, said in Parliament this week when asked about the trash heap.\n\nThe country’s environment agency, he added, “will use all available powers to make sure that the perpetrators cover the cost of the cleanup, which must now follow.”\n\nThe pile of trash, which is made up mostly of household waste, was initially reported to the Environment Agency at the end of June. The organization sent the landlord a cease-and-desist order to prevent further dumping, but when it discovered that the heap had grown in October, it closed the site and opened a criminal investigation.\n\nHow so much trash was dumped without anyone noticing is still a mystery. But a landowner next to the site told the BBC that he saw truckloads of refuse dumped there for months this summer under the cover of night.\n\nCalum Miller, a Parliament member who represents the area, said that the site was “well-chosen to hide criminal activity.”\n\nThe field where the trash was dumped was long, thin and flanked by fully grown trees. Its proximity to the highway and side roads most likely made getting into and out of the site relatively easy, he said.\n\nMr. Miller said that an officer at the local waste authority estimated that it would cost more than the local government's annual budget of £25 million to clean up. He called on the environmental agency to move quickly, noting that the area is next to the Cherwell River, which flows into the Thames, a major waterway, and sits in a flood plain that was fully submerged last year.\n\n“There is a local call for the government to act without delay,” he said, “before we face an environmental disaster.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/africa/nigeria-school-abduction.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:42:27-05:00","title":"At Least 52 Kidnapped From Nigeria School in Second Mass Abduction This Week","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At least 52 schoolchildren and teachers were kidnapped from St. Mary’s Catholic School in Niger state, Nigeria, in a mass abduction that marks the second such incident in the country this week.

2025-11-21T10:42:27-05:00\n\nAt least 52 schoolchildren and teachers have been kidnapped from a school in northwestern Nigeria, according to government officials, the second such attack in the country this week.\n\nArmed men attacked the Catholic school in the state of Niger early on Friday, according to Bello Gidi, an aide to the local government, adding that the number of those kidnapped could be as high as 100. A spokesman at the Diocese of Kontagora, where the school is, said a security officer at the school was shot in the attack.\n\nMass kidnappings have become common in Nigeria, including from boarding schools. On Monday, 24 Muslim girls were abducted from a school in the state of Kebbi, which borders Niger state. One student avoided being kidnapped by hiding in a bathroom, and several others managed to escape.\n\nIn previous kidnappings, some victims have been released in exchange for ransoms, but many have not been heard from again. In 2014, the Boko Haram terrorist group abducted almost 300 girls from a school dormitory in Chibok, in the northeast of the country, in one of the best known mass abductions. Some of the students escaped and others were released, but many remain in captivity.\n\nNigeria is under intense scrutiny over what President Trump and some celebrities, including the rapper Nicki Minaj, have framed as the persecution of Christians. Though Christians are often victims of kidnappings and other violent attacks, there is no evidence that they are targeted more than any other group.\n\nBoarding schools in the area of the latest abduction had been ordered to close after the state government received intelligence that there was an increased threat level, Abubakar Usman, a Niger state official, said in a statement. “Regrettably, St. Mary’s School proceeded to reopen and resume academic activities without notifying or seeking clearance from the State Government, thereby exposing pupils and the staff to avoidable risk,” he said.\n\nMr. Usman added that the security agencies had started “a full-scale investigation and search-and-rescue operations” to bring the abductees home.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccines-autism-website.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:50:29-05:00","title":"Kennedy Says He Told C.D.C. to Change Website’s Language on Autism and Vaccines","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Health Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. said in an interview that he personally instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to abandon its longstanding position that vaccines do not cause autism — a move that underscores his determination to challenge scientific orthodoxy and bend the health department to his will.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday explaining why the C.D.C. website now says the claim that vaccines do not cause autism is not “evidence-based,” Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that large-scale epidemiological studies of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had found no link to autism, and that studies of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal had also shown no link.\n\nBut he cited gaps in vaccine safety science. He said he ordered the C.D.C. to change its guidance in part because high-quality large studies had not been conducted to examine a potential link between autism and other shots given in the first year of life. Those include the hepatitis B vaccine and a combination shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough.\n\nIn his view, sweeping statements like “vaccines don’t cause autism” are unproven, and have been deployed by public health leaders who want to ease parents’ fears. He said he is not saying vaccines cause autism; he is simply saying there is no proof that they don’t.\n\n“The whole thing about ‘vaccines have been tested and there’s been this determination made,’ is just a lie,” Mr. Kennedy said in the interview, his first with a major print publication. He added, “The phrase ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ is not supported by science.”\n\nIt is highly unusual for a health secretary to personally order a change to scientific guidance. Former C.D.C. officials say that such changes are usually initiated by agency scientists, and in some cases might go to the secretary’s office for review. Mr. Kennedy’s intervention flows out of his two decades of vaccine activism, and demonstrates his intense interest in the topic even as other health issues, including the cancellation of insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, are swirling in Washington.\n\nExperts say Mr. Kennedy is correct, in a narrow sense, in saying that certain studies have not yet been done. But they say he is also asking for a level of proof that is difficult to achieve. As Dr. Arthur Caplan, who directs the medical ethics division at New York University, once wryly noted, “You can’t prove that Coca-Cola doesn’t cause autism either.”\n\nMost mainstream public health leaders, including an official at the American Medical Association, a former C.D.C. director and the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, say the question of whether vaccines cause autism has been settled. Mr. Kennedy’s critics say he is cherry-picking facts and seeking studies to confirm his own predetermined conclusion.\n\nBy focusing on a theoretical, unproven risk, critics say, Mr. Kennedy is using his platform as health secretary to discourage vaccination, an issue that earned him millions of dollars and boosted his political career. They accuse him of playing on parents’ fears about autism, while ignoring incontrovertible evidence that vaccines have saved millions of lives.\n\n“There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism but do save lives,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, who led the C.D.C. during the Biden administration. She said the website change damages the C.D.C.’s credibility and “risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.”\n\nThe website changes have once again put the secretary at odds with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and the health committee chairman, who is also a doctor. To win the senator’s vote for confirmation, Mr. Kennedy promised not to remove a statement from the C.D.C. website stating that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nThe statement remains at the top of the site, with an asterisk leading to a footnote that says the header “has not been removed due to an agreement “ with the health committee chairman.\n\nThe page goes on to say that the claim is not “evidence-based” and that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.” It does not mention the live-saving benefits of vaccines.\n\nMr. Cassidy, writing Thursday on the social media platform X, appeared incensed.\n\n“I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,” he wrote. “What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n\nMr. Kennedy said in the interview that he had spoken with the senator about the website changes.\n\n“I did talk to him,” Mr. Kennedy said of Mr. Cassidy. “He disagreed with the decision.” Mr. Cassidy has recently said he would like Mr. Kennedy to appear before his committee; the secretary said he would be “happy to.”\n\nThe introduction of routine childhood immunization is widely considered one of the greatest success stories of public health.\n\nA study published last year in the medical journal The Lancet estimated that since 1974, when the World Health Organization launched its global vaccination program, vaccines had averted 154 million deaths worldwide, including those of 146 million children younger than 5. The C.D.C. has cited vaccines as one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.\n\nBefore the pertussis vaccine became widely available in the 1940s, for example, as many as 200,000 people got sick with whooping cough every year in the United States, and about 9,000 died, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963, about 450 Americans died each year from the disease.\n\nDr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, a trustee of the American Medical Association, said the organization was “deeply concerned that perpetuating misleading claims on vaccines will lead to further confusion, distrust and ultimately, dangerous consequences for individuals and public health.”\n\nConcerns about vaccine safety, which have percolated since the 1980s, intensified in 1998, after a British doctor, Andrew Wakefield, published a small study asserting that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine might be linked to autism. That paper has since been retracted, and numerous studies — including a 10-year study of 600,000 children published in 2019 — have found no association.\n\nA 2018 study that followed 82,000 pregnant women who were given the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine found their babies were not at increased risk for autism.\n\nHowever, Dr. Daniel Salmon, who directs the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Mr. Kennedy was correct about the absence of high-quality, large-scale epidemiological research on autism and infants given the vaccines for hepatitis B and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Dr. Salmon has long advocated greater federal investment in vaccine safety science.\n\n“I think that there are gaps in science that need to be filled,” Dr. Salmon said. “We need a research agenda and we need to make it a priority to answer these questions, but it’s got to be done with rigorous science, and the science is really hard to do.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a frequent critic of Mr. Kennedy, said that studies of the measles vaccine were prompted by the Wakefield paper. He said no reputable scientists had made similar claims that would warrant investigations into other vaccines.\n\n“So what’s his hypothesis?” Dr. Offit asked, referring to Mr. Kennedy. “What is it about the hepatitis B vaccine that he thinks causes autism?”\n\nEpidemiological studies, which look at large populations, show only associations and do not prove cause and effect. Mr. Kennedy argues that scientists must pay more attention to “vulnerable subgroups” of children who are not identified by such studies, and might be at risk for vaccine injuries. He also wants research into biological mechanisms or genetic factors that might make certain children vulnerable.\n\nBut the question of whether additional vaccine safety research is needed is separate from the question of whether children should be vaccinated, Dr. Salmon said.\n\nIn 1986, Congress passed a law, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, that offered vaccine makers liability protection from lawsuits and required the C.D.C. to conduct a review of pertussis and rubella vaccines. (The pertussis vaccine that was in use in 1986 is no longer administered in the United States.)\n\nMr. Kennedy said in the interview that he ordered the website changes in part because the C.D.C. had not complied with that requirement.\n\nDr. Cohen, the former C.D.C. director, said the research had been done, pointing to a 1994 study by the Institute of Medicine, She said the C.D.C. carefully weighs all known benefits and risks before making vaccine recommendations.\n\nBut Mr. Kennedy asserted that the agency had not met the law’s directive to “post representations of science with the best, highest quality data.”\n\nHe noted that comprehensive reviews of existing vaccine safety science, including by the Institute of Medicine, have called for additional research into broad questions of vaccine safety.\n\nThe Informed Consent Action Network, a nonprofit led by Del Bigtree, Mr. Kennedy’s former communications director, lauded the website changes as vindication for parents who claim vaccines are a cause of their child’s autism. The group had sued the C.D.C. in 2020 demanding that the “vaccines do not cause autism” statement be removed.\n\nJessica Steier, a public health scientist who specializes in science communications, argues that in calling for additional research, Mr. Kennedy is following a well-worn playbook of his movement.\n\n“Vaccine critics like Mr. Kennedy often give the impression that scientists haven’t seriously researched whether vaccines might cause autism,” Dr. Steier wrote in an August opinion piece in The New York Times. Her own review found “more than 40 high-quality studies since 1998 involving over 5.6 million people across seven countries,” she wrote. “All found no connection between vaccines and autism.”\n\nDr. Offit likened the secretary’s call for more studies to a never-ending “game of Whac-a-Mole” in which each time a question is answered, Mr. Kennedy and his allies raise new ones.\n\n“They just keep moving the goal posts,” Dr. Offit said. The changes to the C.D.C. website, he said, are “unnecessarily scaring parents at a time when vaccine rates are already eroding.”\n\nMr. Kennedy suggested it is not his job to frame messages with an eye toward tamping down parents’ fears.\n\n“I think the way to drive up vaccine utilization, ultimately, is to be honest with people,” he said, adding, “My job is not to gaslight Americans but to give them accurate information about the state of the science.”\n\nApoorva Mandavilli and Christina Jewett contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/opinion/america-china-trump-g20.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:05-05:00","title":"The Thucydides Trap Is Coming for America","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article challenges the traditional view of the Thucydides Trap by arguing that the United States, not China, may be the one entering the trap under President Trump’s aggressive, isolationist, and militarized foreign policy.

longest ever government shutdown. But one belief has endured on both sides of the aisle: that the world order, built and led by the United States, is under threat from China, which aims to usurp America’s rightful place atop it.\n\nThere’s a phrase that encapsulates the theory: the Thucydides trap, referring to the violent clash that comes when a rising power challenges the ruling hegemon. In Thucydides’ time, it was Athens that threatened — and then made its own — the pre-eminence of Sparta. But it is a pattern that has played out repeatedly through history, with the ambition and aggression of the challenger almost always ending in bloodshed.\n\nPresident Trump’s second term has upended this assumption. With its litany of chaos, the administration has pursued all on its own a root-and-branch destruction of the global order America made — threatening invasions, deploying punitive tariffs indiscriminately and all but abandoning longstanding alliances. China, by contrast, has responded mostly with a steely insistence on the status quo. In a startling reversal, it is America, not China, that seems determined to spring Thucydides’ trap. At the world’s summit, America is overthrowing America.\n\nThe bipartisan consensus, now showing signs of strain, was built on a misreading of China’s intentions. That, at least, is the argument of a provocative recent paper published in the M.I.T. journal International Security by three East Asia scholars. “China is a status quo power concerned with regime stability,” the authors write, “and it remains more inwardly focused than externally oriented.”\n\nThis cleareyed analysis was based on an examination of a vast corpus of Chinese documents and publications, from official speeches to school curriculums. The conclusions were striking. China’s stated territorial concerns, the authors found, do not extend beyond its long-held claim to Taiwan and relatively small border areas. “China’s aims are unambiguous; China’s aims are enduring; and China’s aims are limited,” they write.\n\nMuch of China’s foreign policy, rather than exporting its ideology abroad, is aimed at shoring up the power of the Communist Party at home. What outside observers take to be aggressive moves are often aimed at solving internal problems. Take its Belt and Road Initiative, which some see as a quasi-imperial effort to win the loyalty of developing nations. One of the paper’s authors, Zenobia Chan, a scholar of international relations who teaches at Georgetown University, said that the initiative was driven more by internal considerations than global ambition.\n\n“A lot of it is driven by domestic needs, excess industrial capacity after the global financial crisis,” she told me. China has for the most part not sought to use these investments as leverage for its global ambitions, she added, beyond its longstanding demand that its partners adhere to a One China policy and avoid recognizing the independence of Taiwan. It certainly has not asked developing nations to choose between itself and the United States.\n\nChina, to be sure, is hardly a virtuous or even benign actor on the global stage. Its aggression in the South China Sea, vicious repression in Xinjiang, crackdown on Hong Kong and implacable desire to claim Taiwan — no matter what the Taiwanese people want — pose serious challenges to peace and order in Asia and challenge basic principles of human rights. The escalating diplomatic spat with Japan, suspending seafood imports and advising citizens to avoid travel there, demonstrates China’s capacity for menace.\n\nBut these actions, however brutal, fall far short of a fundamental reordering of the world. China seems to be asserting what it views as historical claims and domestic prerogatives within the existing system, bending the rules in ways the United States, especially under Trump, is hardly in a position to protest. The distinction matters: A power defending the status quo, even aggressively, poses different challenges than one seeking to remake the world in its image.\n\nIt may be outmoded, in any case, to think of a single power superintending the world. “It is not simply that the United States is in relative decline, or even that China is rising, but rather that compared with earlier decades, power is held more widely and by a variety of powers in different regions,” Emma Ashford writes in her bracing new book, “First Among Equals.” “The United States and China are ahead of the pack, but by far less than their Cold War counterparts.” Multipolar complexity, not bipolar confrontation, is the future.\n\nTrump, it’s fair to say, is not responding well to this reality. Of his wild threats, the recent one suggesting military action against Nigeria — on the ground that it “continues to allow the killing of Christians” — is perhaps the most symptomatic of his frustration. The United States, of course, has always played by its own set of rules. But Trump has abandoned even a fig leaf of fealty to principle. “It’s one thing to say: There’s some rules of international law that don’t apply to us,” the political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta told me. “It’s another thing to say: I really don’t care what international law is.”\n\nTrump or no, the military adventurism of the past two decades has become an unmistakable sign of decline. “If we’re having to maintain primacy by invading this country that’s not posing a threat to us and launching a global campaign of antiterror, clearly, we’re on the decline,” Van Jackson, a progressive foreign policy scholar and an author of “The Rivalry Peril,” told me. “It has always been the case in these cycles of history that when the dominant power starts investing and playing this military role globally, you have rising powers who are stepping up, playing a more important economic role globally.”\n\nHistory is littered with examples of the dangers of aggression for declining powers — Spain’s crusading military folly in the 16th century, the late Ottoman Empire’s embrace of ethnic nationalism, Britain’s vain attempt to cling to its unsustainable imperial position between the world wars. Each end the same way: an astonishingly rapid loss of power and prestige on the global stage.\n\nThis might not be exactly what’s happening. For all Trump’s threats of military action abroad, with the exception of the brief airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and the bombing of small boats in the Caribbean, he seems most interested in deploying the military to police American citizens. In part, this may be training troops — as he told the military brass — for adventures abroad. But it’s hard not to think that waging battles against people who live in Democrat-governed cities is an end in itself.\n\nLikewise, Trump’s aggressive tariff warfare has less to do with the world than it seems. The volley was supposedly about leveling the playing field with countries that are “ripping off” America and punishing countries whose policies harm Americans. (Fentanyl is a prime example.) But the recent Supreme Court arguments over Trump’s use of tariffs made clear that these levies raise cash mostly from Americans, bypassing the constitutional power of the purse vested in Congress. The tariffs, in short, looked global but hit locally.\n\nThis leads to an irresistible irony. Far from beating back China, America under Trump may come to resemble it. The country is on its way: obsessed with regime stability and willing to use almost any means to keep its people under control; jealously guarding its near periphery while remaining largely uninterested in leading the world; and building a cult of personality around its autocratic leader in an atmosphere of ethnonationalist triumphalism.\n\nTrump, despite his vituperative campaign rhetoric, has never really been a China hawk, even if some around him have led the charge for more aggressive policies to blunt China’s might. Indeed, he has often lavished praise on Xi Jinping, a man who has the kind of virtually limitless power Trump clearly craves. “President Xi is a great leader of a great country,” Trump cooed at their meeting in South Korea last month.\n\nThis praise comes as the United States is retreating from the multilateral bodies that it helped create — the United Nations, the World Health Organization and more. As for the Group of 20, starting this weekend in South Africa, Trump announced months ago that he would not attend and would dispatch Vice President JD Vance instead. Vance has played the role of finger-wagging attack dog, lecturing Europeans about free speech and dressing down President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. One can only imagine what he might have said in Johannesburg.\n\nBut we will never know, because Trump abruptly announced earlier this month that the United States would boycott the meeting entirely, preposterously claiming that white South Africans were the victims of persecution and genocidal violence at the hands of the country’s Black majority. “No U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue,” Trump wrote on social media. Then on Thursday, the administration changed course again, asking to send a small, low-level delegation after all, though it would not participate in the summit discussions.\n\nChina is playing a much longer and more sophisticated game. Premier Li Qiang, Xi’s top emissary, will be in Johannesburg, accompanied by a vast retinue of officials, ready to talk with the world’s major economies about the problems and possibilities of the emerging multipolar order.\n\nAs its primacy fades, the United States now faces a choice: meet rising nations as respected partners in building a new, more equitable multipolar world or seek the costly, brittle power that comes from domination. Trump has chosen the latter; China, it seems, seeks the former. History tells us which path leads to peace and prosperity, and which is the road to ruin.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

L.A. Has a Price for That.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T09:00:07-05:00\n\nLos Angeles has found a new source of revenue to help fund the 2028 Olympics: charging companies extra to keep their naming rights on sports venues during the Summer Games.\n\nUntil now, the International Olympic Committee has required stadiums with naming rights deals to use more generic names during the Games.\n\nBut LA28, the city’s Olympic organizing committee, is striking deals with big companies to pay to keep or add their names to Olympic venues in Southern California.\n\nOn Friday, Intuit announced a sponsorship deal that will retain its name on Intuit Dome, home of the Los Angeles Clippers, during the Olympics. Honda announced in August that it would pay to keep its name on Honda Center, home of the Anaheim Ducks, when the arena holds volleyball tournaments during the Games. Comcast will sponsor a temporary squash center at Universal Studios for the Olympics.\n\nPaul Krekorian, the executive director of major events for Los Angeles, said that the new naming rights deals help ensure the “financial responsibility” of hosting the Games. The Los Angeles Games are expected to cost nearly $7 billion.\n\n“As the host city, Los Angeles has a strong interest in ensuring the success of the Games while also protecting our taxpayers,” Mr. Krekorian said. “With LA28’s revenue already ahead of pace, and incredibly strong enthusiasm building toward 2028, I’m confident these Games will be a financial success and leave tremendous benefits for Angelenos for generations to come.”\n\nLos Angeles was also an innovator in raising money the last time it hosted the Olympics, in 1984. At that time, it struck deals with a smaller number of big sponsors to give more money to the Games, raising $123 million. The model was adopted for future Games, and it is now a key source of funding for host cities, the I.O.C. says.\n\nCasey Wasserman, the chairman of LA28, lauded the Intuit partnership in a statement. He has previously said that he hoped the new naming rights arrangements, currently a pilot project, would help build a new commercial model for the Olympics.\n\nIntuit, which owns TurboTax, Credit Karma and QuickBooks, did not disclose how much it would pay to retain the naming rights. The Intuit Dome, which has a capacity of 18,000 people, will host basketball in the 2028 Games. As part of its sponsorship deal with LA28 and Team U.S.A., Intuit said it would help create opportunities for local businesses to become suppliers for the Games.\n\nHonda and Comcast also did not disclose terms of their deals.\n\nHad the Olympics decided not to break from its longstanding tradition of stripping naming rights, the Intuit Dome would have been temporarily renamed the Inglewood Dome during the 2028 Games.\n\nWhen LA28 announced the naming rights deal with Honda, it said that the new strategy would support “the largest commercial revenue raise in sports.”\n\nIn addition to asking existing companies to pay to retain naming rights, LA28 said that as many as 19 temporary venues could also take on the name of a corporate partner.\n\n“What this, I think, does is allows L.A. to be a little more creative in terms of the range of places they’re going to try to get money from to sponsor the Olympics,” said Matthew Burbank, a University of Utah political science professor who has written about the Olympics.\n\nThe practice of temporarily shedding corporate naming rights has been longstanding during the Olympic Games in other host cities. For example, during the 2012 Games in London, the O2 arena, named after the British telecommunications company, was renamed the North Greenwich Arena.\n\nOther international events, such as the FIFA World Cup, have followed similar policies. When the World Cup comes to Southern California in 2026, SoFi Stadium in Inglewood will be temporarily renamed Los Angeles Stadium.\n\nLos Angeles also broke tradition when it hosted the 1984 Olympic Games. That year, the Olympics tried a new financial model that allowed a limited number of companies to become official sponsors of the Games, a change from previous years when the Games had many small sponsors.\n\n“In ’84, the I.O.C., in all honesty, was quite skeptical that this model was going to work,” Mr. Burbank said. “They were very strategic in how they went about doing it, and as a result of that, the I.O.C. essentially said, ‘Hey, that worked. We’re going to adopt this.’”\n\nThe 1984 Games were able to turn a profit and produced a surplus, said Mr. Krekorian, the executive director of major Los Angeles events. That money is still being used to finance youth sports programs in Los Angeles.\n\nIt is unclear whether the corporate sponsors of other venues also plan to retain naming rights during the 2028 Olympics. Crypto.com Arena, home to the Los Angeles Lakers, Sparks and Kings, did not respond to a request for comment. The arena will host artistic and trampoline gymnastics, boxing and wheelchair basketball during the Games.\n\nDignity Health Sports Park, home of the L.A. Galaxy in Carson, Calif., also did not respond to a request for comment. The soccer stadium will host archery and rugby sevens.\n\nThe I.O.C.’s willingness to go along with a new approach may be a concession to reality as much as a money-raising opportunity. It’s not clear that residents of Los Angeles would call well-known sports venues by new names just because Olympic organizers told them to. For example, Many residents still refer to Crypto.com Arena as the Staples Center, which was the longtime name of the arena until the naming rights changed in 2021.\n\n“It’s not uncommon,” Mr. Burbank said. “People get used to calling it a certain thing.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/business/dealbook/stocks-crypto-fed-market-turmoil.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:01:41-05:00","title":"Three Potential Factors Behind the Market Turmoil","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The stock market is experiencing significant volatility due to conflicting economic data: persistent inflation and rising unemployment are keeping the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, while soaring stock valuations raise fears of a market correction.

The stock market has been on a roller coaster this week, despite Nvidia’s better-than-expected earnings. What’s driving the disconnect? The truth is that inflation remains persistent (which makes the Fed reluctant to lower interest rates). But at the same time, unemployment appears to be climbing (in which case, you’d want the Fed to lower rates).\n\nAll the while, stock valuations are near record highs — leading some on Wall Street to say that a comedown could be due. On Main Street, though, the watchword of the moment is “affordability.” We get into all of this below along with some A.I. hacks that a C.E.O. uses to get feedback about his own work.\n\nBuckle up. Global stocks and Bitcoin are falling again on Friday as Wall Street tries to make sense of the volatile trading that has rocked the markets in recent days.\n\nMarket veterans see several potential catalysts, including doubts about the Fed’s interest rate policy, jitters about artificial intelligence and spillover from a crypto sell-off. Some analysts are also growing antsy that strong quarterly results from Walmart and Nvidia failed to restore market calm.\n\nThe latest:\n\nStocks in Asia and Europe are down broadly.\n\nS&P 500 futures point to a choppy open. That’s after the benchmark index suffered its biggest intraday swing on Thursday — a peak-to-trough drop of roughly 3.5 percent — since April, when President Trump’s tariffs announcement triggered a major sell-off.\n\nThe Nasdaq, which sank 2.2 percent on Thursday, is on pace for its worst week since April.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, or so-called VIX fear gauge, also spiked to April levels.\n\nBitcoin briefly fell below $82,000, extending its bear-market slump.\n\nAre tech valuation jitters to blame? Nvidia’s stellar results have so far failed to dispel investor concerns over Big Tech’s lavish spending on A.I. On Wednesday, Jensen Huang, the company’s C.E.O., pushed back firmly against bubble talk during a call with analysts.\n\nPrivately he grumbled that “the market did not appreciate” what Nvidia had just pulled off.\n\n“If we delivered a bad quarter, if we’re off by just a hair, if it just looked a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart,” Huang told employees on Thursday, according to Business Insider. (But Cathie Wood, the prominently bullish tech investor, cheered the results, with one of her funds buying a slug of Nvidia shares on Thursday.)\n\nIs the Fed also a factor? Anna Paulson, the Philadelphia Fed president, was the latest central bank official to caution against bold action on interest rates.\n\nFutures traders currently see just a 33-percent chance that the Fed would cut rates next month, fueling investor fears that higher-for-longer borrowing costs could dampen appetite for risky assets.\n\nIs crypto playing a role, too? Bitcoin is on an 11-day losing streak and has fallen more than 30 percent in the past six weeks. Given the record level of leveraged trading in digital tokens, some market watchers are worrying that investors are being forced to sell other assets, like stocks, to cover crypto margin calls.\n\n“I think crypto is a canary in the coal mine,” Salman Ahmed, the global head of macro strategy at Fidelity, told Bloomberg Television on Friday.\n\nU.S. banks are said to have scrapped a $20 billion bailout plan for Argentina. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have dropped an effort to create an enormous loan for the embattled South American nation as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to help President Javier Milei, according to The Wall Street Journal. The banks are now reportedly weighing a $5 billion repurchase plan for Argentina to exchange investments for dollars and later issue bonds to repay the lenders.\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly pushed Davos organizers to change their agenda. President Trump agreed to attend the World Economic Forum in person in January — after organizers made assurances that certain issues wouldn’t be featured prominently at the gathering of political and business leaders, according to The Financial Times. Among the topics that U.S. officials asked to be played down or avoided: female empowerment, climate change and international development finance.\n\nFirst-round takeover bids for Warner Bros. Discovery are in. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast all submitted offers for the media giant by a deadline Thursday, The Times reports. Paramount emphasized it wanted to buy all of Warner Bros. to create a new entertainment colossus; Comcast is seeking to buy Warner Bros.’ Hollywood studio and combine it with Universal, which it owns; and Netflix has made an unusual pledge to continue releasing Warner Bros. movies theatrically.\n\nFor politicians and business executives alike, the message of the times can be summed up in one word: affordability.\n\nIt is the topic that has dominated the White House’s economic policies and messaging since Democrats scored unexpectedly big gains in elections earlier this month. (It’s also expected to be a major topic of Friday’s scheduled meeting between President Trump and Zohran Mamdani, New York City’s mayor-elect.)\n\nIt’s also weighing heavily on consumer-facing companies.\n\nSigns of the times:\n\nTarget’s chief commercial officer, Rick Gomez, mentioned “affordability” four times in his opening remarks during the retailer’s earnings call this week. “Sentiment is at a three-year low amid concerns about jobs, affordability and tariffs,” he told analysts, noting that the company had lowered its prices on “thousands” of foods and other items.\n\nDoug McMillon, Walmart’s departing C.E.O., told analysts on Thursday that “lower-income families have been under additional pressure of late.”\n\nJohn David Rainey, Walmart’s C.F.O., put things starkly: The difference in wage growth between high- and low-income households last month, he said, “was as large as it’s been in almost a decade.”\n\nData from Bank of America published this month showed that 29 percent of lower-income households were now living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nConsumer sentiment dropped nearly 30 percent year-on-year earlier this month, according to preliminary survey data from the University of Michigan. (Updated results are due out on Friday.)\n\nEven higher-income households are making adjustments. They’re feeling more confident than their less-affluent counterparts. The University of Michigan researchers found that sentiment among the top third of consumers, as determined by the size of their stock holdings, went up 11 percent between October and November.\n\nBut McMillon noted that upper- and middle-income households were driving Walmart’s growth, and that the retailer will “continue to benefit from higher-income families choosing to shop with us more often.”\n\nHow much longer will affordability loom over Trump’s domestic policy agenda? The president has already made moves, such as lowering tariffs on some food items, to address Americans’ affordability concerns.\n\nBut one of his most prominent recent promises — $2,000 tariff “dividend checks” to be sent to Americans — may face longer odds of becoming reality, after the Congressional Budget Office found that his levies will reduce deficits by $1 trillion less than previously estimated.\n\nAnd companies warned that they remained on guard for price-increase drivers. McMillon told analysts on Thursday that Walmart would “continue working to resist the upward pressure on our cost of goods.”\n\nWhether it be through crypto or real estate deals, the Trump family has had a banner year in business since Donald Trump became president in January.\n\nNow The Times has found that the family of Howard Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, has experienced a similar boom in deals.\n\nThe investigation focuses on the secretary’s sons, Kyle and Brandon, who have profited from a series of projects that their father has boosted during his role as a federal official.\n\nThere was no evidence that Lutnick had intervened in policy discussions with the intention of driving business to his family, The Times found. But as he promoted one top administration priority — the construction of artificial intelligence data centers — business has flowed to Newmark Group, a real estate firm controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald where Lutnick was the C.E.O. until this year.\n\nThe deal-making from Washington has also drawn in at least one major Republican donor and U.S. trading partners.\n\nFrom the report:\n\nIn that role, Mr. Lutnick has twisted the arms of American allies, dangling policy favors in exchange for investments in U.S. industrial projects. At times, these tactics have created opportunities for his family’s clients to gain access to much-needed foreign capital, The Times found.\n\nMr. Lutnick, for example, demanded that the South Korean government invest billions of dollars in U.S. industry to reduce tariffs.\n\nNewmark recently announced it had completed more than $25 billion worth of data center deals in the past year, taking a fee on each transaction. “We are having our best year ever,” Brandon Lutnick said at a conference in Switzerland last month.\n\nEvery week, we’re asking a leader how he or she uses artificial intelligence. Glenn Fogel, who leads Booking Holdings, the parent company of brands including Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable, told DealBook’s Sarah Kessler that A.I. helps critique his communication style. His answers have been condensed and edited.\n\nHow do you personally use A. I.?\n\nIf you put a recording of a presentation or meeting into an A.I. model and ask it to analyze what you could have done better, it will give you feedback. And it’s not trying to suck up to the boss. It has been very honest to me at times, and I’m glad it’s just between me and the model.\n\nHave you given any directives to your team about what you want them to do with A. I.? I’ve talked with some C.E.O.s who, for example, have set goals for increasing productivity by a certain percentage.\n\nEverything is so new and changing so rapidly that it’s hard to guess the future. It can be difficult to measure productivity increases, even after the fact.\n\nFor example, we believe we are coding more efficiently. But the actual writing of the code is only one part of a developer’s job. You can ask how many lines of code are produced by each developer. But that’s probably not a good measurement, because some of the code that’s produced by an A.I. model is very verbose. And so do you now have to do more checking of the code because it is produced by a model?\n\nIt’s not easy to pinpoint how much efficiency has really been created. We know it has. But to come back with a measurement, that is not so easy to do yet.\n\nWhat does that difficulty mean for your decision-making?\n\nIt doesn’t inhibit us. But in our budget process, it’s more difficult. How many more developers do we think we’ll need next year? I guess the conclusion is it just requires us to be very, very agile.\n\nAbbott Laboratories agreed to buy the cancer-screening firm Exact Sciences for $21 billion, in the biggest health care deal in two years.

Still, Rockoff acts like he knows where everything is.\n\nOver there, his old military uniform. Over here, a computer chess game and war films he has enjoyed. On the ceiling, model planes he built and toy aircraft fashioned from beer cans by street children in Vietnam.\n\nThe locker in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has been outfitted with a bathroom and darkroom but there is nowhere to cook, and the packed boxes are so numerous that there is no longer room for a bed. Rockoff usually sleeps outside on a chair.\n\nHe says that instead of packing all his stuff into a warehouse, “I live in a warehouse.”\n\n“I live humbly,” he said in a recent interview. “I do the best I can.”\n\nHis stuff includes both the relics and the residue of a life largely defined by the years Rockoff spent documenting the ravages of war in Southeast Asia. Rockoff was a U.S. Army photographer in Vietnam and later a freelancer in Cambodia, where on April 17, 1975, he was one of the few to record the end of its civil war as the insurgent Khmer Rouge marched victoriously into the capital, Phnom Penh.\n\nIn 1984, John Malkovich portrayed Rockoff in the movie “The Killing Fields,” which depicted the savagery of the Khmer Rouge takeover. Based on an article by Sydney Schanberg, the New York Times correspondent in Cambodia, the movie focused on the suffering that Dith Pran, Schanberg’s photographer and translator, endured after he was seized by the insurgents.\n\nRockoff hates the film. He’s said it mischaracterized his efforts to protect Dith as somehow flawed.\n\nFor decades, thousands of Rockoff’s unpublished images from that era filled cases that sat amid his sea of belongings. But they were removed from the locker more than a year ago under circumstances that have now become the source of a bitter dispute.\n\nDivining the precise roots of Rockoff’s tumbledown life in Florida, where he has lived since the late 1970s, can be difficult. But certainly a footloose spirit, poverty, intransigence and, most significantly, war, have played their parts.\n\nRockoff, son of a Navy man, joined the Army in 1965 and became a military photographer, working in foxholes in the Vietnamese jungle. He still recalls the scared, accusing looks G.I.s gave his camera, as if worried his picture taking was a precursor to something darker.\n\nAfter Rockoff’s discharge in 1973, he returned to Cambodia, where he developed a reputation for smoking pot and taking risks while photographing the brutal civil war for The Times and others as a freelancer. Some colleagues viewed Rockoff as dangerously reckless. The Associated Press stopped buying his work, convinced the images were not worth the calamity Rockoff seemed intent on hurtling toward.\n\nOnce, at Kampong Chhnang, north of Phnom Penh, shrapnel punctured his heart, sending him into cardiac arrest. A Red Cross field doctor had to slice open his chest to get it beating again. He was flown out of the country for treatment but returned to Cambodia five weeks later.\n\n“He really chronicled what war was like,” said Claudia Rizzi, a journalist and documentary producer, “and what bodies looked like when they are abandoned on a roadside for three weeks and what a field hospital looks like, not the ‘M*A*S*H’ version.”\n\nMany photographs were so grisly, it was clear no newspaper would ever print them.\n\nRockoff admits feeling compelled to show “the blood and guts.”\n\n“Maybe if people saw more of it there will be less of it,” he said recently.\n\nToday, Rockoff, 77, is thin and frail, his skin deeply weathered and tanned, his hair and beard gray and unkempt. His blue eyes remain shiny and piercing, though on a recent visit from a reporter he chose to wear sunglasses along with a dark plaid shirt, wide open at the neck, and baggy blue trousers. A few days earlier he had been hospitalized, and he bent over to show the stitches in his scalp.\n\nWhile he is at times good humored, friends say he is often forgetful and moody, paranoid and quick to anger.\n\n“Al was a complicated figure, clearly much traumatized by his immersion in combat in Vietnam,” said Stephen Heder, an expert on Cambodia at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, who met him in Phnom Penh.\n\nRockoff was diagnosed with PTSD more than 20 years ago and takes medications for it, his ex-wife, Victoria Bornas, said.\n\n“Has he got the weight of his memories with him? Absolutely,” said Mary Patricia Nunan, a journalist and podcaster who has been friends with Rockoff for decades.\n\nIn interviews over a period of days, Rockoff, sometimes lucid, sometimes not, recalled rivalries and friendships, respect for some journalists, disdain for others, and vivid scenes from the day that Phnom Penh fell. He remembered hitching rides on the jeeps and tanks swarming into the capital, his Nikon slung around his neck. His photos captured the Khmer Rouge soldiers, many just teenagers, marching into the city in mud-stained black pajamas, some wearing sandals, others barefoot, cradling AK-47s, M-16s, grenade launchers.\n\nAt least 1.7 million Cambodians would die under the regime of the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, and Rockoff photographed the incipient violence. Government soldiers being marched through the streets to an uncertain fate. Leaders of the deposed regime negotiating for their survival — in vain.\n\nAfter dark that day, Rockoff sought refuge in the French embassy and hid his film in the tank of a broken toilet. Three weeks later, he taped the canisters to his inner thighs when the last foreigners were ordered onto trucks and thrown out of the country.\n\n“I didn’t want the Communists to take them from me,” he said in the interview. “I did OK. I got my shit out.”\n\nRockoff has never really capitalized on most of those images, or those he took on many trips to Cambodia after it opened up again in the 1990s, although on one trip in 2000, he put on a rare sale of his prints in Phnom Penh.\n\n“He didn’t want to make money off that misery,” said Bornas, his ex-wife, who serves as something of a caretaker for him.\n\nMoney has never been a motivator for Rockoff, who gets by these days on an Army disability pension and Social Security. Work has been sporadic, and he has largely resisted efforts to help him market his work. Nunan said a publisher tried to get Rockoff to consider a book, but he angrily dismissed the idea, wanting to retain control of his work. Many friends agree that perhaps his most consistent trait is his difficulty in accepting, or appreciating, help.\n\n“I am more interested in my pictures than people’s admiration,” Rockoff said when asked about efforts to display or sell his work. “I am not winning a popularity contest.”\n\nHe has over the years talked of building a book on his own terms before he dies, but he has not made much progress.\n\n“We joked that he didn’t really want to finish the book because the day he finished that book he would die,” Rizzi said.\n\nTo ever complete such a project, Rockoff would need all those negatives and slides he had stored away in plastic cases as the clutter of his locker built around them.\n\nBy last year, the mess had grown to the point where the landlord threatened eviction.\n\n“THE WAREHOUSE YOU CURRENTLY RENT FROM ME IS A FIRE HAZARD,” the notice said.\n\nFor months, two men had already been helping to clean the mess up. But some of Rockoff’s longtime friends now worry that the tidying up went entirely too far.\n\nOne of the men who helped Rockoff was an old friend, Arch Hall Jr., 81, a former actor and pilot who had flown relief supplies into Phnom Penh and now lives in Florida.\n\nThe other was Brad Bledsoe, Hall’s friend from Indiana. Bledsoe, something of a Vietnam War buff and collector, had heard of Rockoff from “The Killing Fields,” and told Hall he’d be interested in meeting him.\n\n“The first day we discovered him, we went down there, I tell you, he looked like near death,” Hall said.\n\nRockoff’s difficulties had deepened as his health deteriorated from a variety of ailments. Cataracts were affecting his sight and a stroke earlier in 2023 had caused him to fall, gash his head and spend weeks in the hospital.\n\nBledsoe and Hall began taking him out to meals and bought him clothes, an iPhone and iPad, a refrigerator, microwave, radios, a reclining chair and an inflatable bed that he ended up not using much.\n\n“If it was not for me and Arch, he would be dead a year,” Bledsoe, 59, said in an interview.\n\nBledsoe took a particular interest in Rockoff’s photographs. Though he works in aerospace engineering — just where, he will not say — he has experience with auctions and estate sales. The website for Aether Estate Services lists him and his wife as the operators of franchises in Indiana and Florida, though Bledsoe said the Florida business is inactive and the Indiana one is really run by his wife. He only helps a bit, he said.\n\nIn early 2024, Bledsoe and Hall had Rockoff sign some prints left over from his 2000 Phnom Penh exhibition. Bledsoe said he would try to market them. He later printed out others for Rockoff to see and created a website with the potential to sell and draw attention to Rockoff’s work. At the same time, Bledsoe and Hall stepped in to clean and reorganize Rockoff’s home.\n\n“I am so happy that you are willing to help,” Bornas wrote in a text to Bledsoe.\n\nBledsoe said he found important items on the floor, such as a letter to Schanberg, the correspondent, and a telegram to Rockoff’s mother alerting her that her son had been hospitalized after being hit by shrapnel.\n\n“What’s amazing about Al, he saved everything,” Bledsoe said. “But it’s randomly thrown around and scattered like confetti, and you are walking on it, you are stepping on it.”\n\nWhen the eviction seemed imminent, Bledsoe hired a dumpster for lesser items and threw some things out. The landlord backed off.\n\nMonths later, though, Bornas said she noted that Rockoff’s most important possessions — the cases that contained his negatives — appeared to be missing. He hadn’t noticed, she said, possibly because he thought they were safe.\n\nGetting Rockoff to remember how he felt about an event months ago in his life is daunting. He is mercurial and often overtaken by anger when pressed to focus. But Bornas recalls how upset she was and how she had complained to the landlord and also contacted friends.\n\nIn one March email to a friend, she wrote: “Bledsoe was able to talk Al into giving him his entire collection of negatives, which Brad now has in his possession.”\n\nBledsoe said Rockoff asked him to rescue the images before they were lost or damaged. “Multiple times Al told me he wanted me to preserve his legacy and be the guardian over his legacy,” he said.\n\nThe website he is building is intended to honor Rockoff’s work, he said, and would help the photographer live a more comfortable life. Bledsoe said he and Rockoff made a handshake agreement to split any income until he had recouped the cost of building the website and caring for Rockoff during his visits to Florida. After that, all income would go to Rockoff, he said.\n\n“Look, I said, ‘A book’s fine, but it’s a lot of work. Let’s start with the website,’” Bledsoe said. “My goal is a comrade-in-arms kind of thing.”\n\nHall agreed with Bledsoe’s account. “We discussed merchandising,” he said. “We discussed there would be great T-shirt slogans. Everything to try to help Al.”\n\n“He begged Brad to save his life’s work because it was in terrible shape,” Hall said. Some of the negatives, he said, were already nearly ruined.\n\nBut Bornas and Rizzi expressed concern that after more than a year, Bledsoe has not provided an inventory of what he took or a document stipulating how Rockoff’s images would be sold and the revenues divided.\n\nStill, Rockoff has refused to make any kind of formal complaint about the negatives and has never directly complained to Bledsoe.\n\n“A big part of the issue here is Al,” said Nunan, his friend. “He has never taken steps to professionally protect himself, and that left the door open so that it looks like he has been taken advantage of.”\n\nBledsoe said there had been no time to draw up a contract given the urgency of saving Rockoff’s work. Inventorying such a large collection, he added, is too massive a project for him to take on given his full-time job. He said he is open to a more formal written agreement now, but he and Hall want to hear from Rockoff directly and find it impossible to reach him. They say they fear he has been manipulated to reject what he once agreed to.\n\nTheir perspective: Who could be against an effort to create a website to rescue Rockoff and put the spotlight back on a man whose work deserves to be at the center of any conversation about war photography?\n\n“I have no problem with returning some of Al’s items or all of his items as long as I am compensated for my expenses first, per our agreement,” Bledsoe said.\n\nIt’s true that Rockoff found it difficult to operate the phone that Bledsoe gave him and that Bornas is now avoiding Bledsoe’s calls.\n\n“Al has been left out of this,” she said in an interview. “They are doing this on their own. Al never asked him to print up his photos and sell them.”\n\nBornas acknowledges she was once supportive of the website but she said she thought it was designed to present a small selection of Rockoff’s images, not a commercial enterprise potentially involving all of his life’s work.\n\nThe dispute is at something of a stalemate. Nothing is yet for sale on the website, which is registered to Bledsoe but where the pages are clearly marked to indicate that Rockoff holds the copyright. Recently, there has been renewed concern about the conditions at Rockoff’s locker, a new eviction notice and an incident to which the police responded.\n\nIf Rockoff were to die, Bledsoe said he would likely continue the website until he had been reimbursed, give some proceeds to Bornas, and then donate the negatives to a museum.\n\nBut Rockoff is not dead, and his voice has often been absent from the debate. All parties appear to agree that he forgets things. Did he consent once and now has changed his mind? Could he consent, given his issues with memory and PTSD? Did Bledsoe and Hall interpret something more than Rockoff meant?\n\nRockoff reacts with rage when pressed on the matter.\n\n“I didn’t give him anything,” he said. “If he has them, he has got to give them back.”\n\nThe images are in many ways his messy children. They remain the organizing principle of his life, and he brightens when he discusses working to order them and even one day the dream of a book, however remote.\n\n“I have a lot of work to do before I pass on,” he said. “I will be working at it when I die.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/europe/ukraine-russia-us-peace-plan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:24:09-05:00","title":"The U.S. Tightens the Vise on an Already Besieged Zelensky","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is facing an existential dilemma as the United States presents a 28-point peace proposal that demands significant territorial concessions, including the cession of key cities in Donetsk and Luhansk, recognition of Russian control over occupied regions, and a cap on the Ukrainian military at 600,000.

Ukraine has rejected many of the conditions before, but Kyiv’s room for maneuver is shrinking as the Trump administration pushes for a response by next week.\n\nMr. Zelensky referred to the tightening vise in a speech to the nation on Friday. He cast the American proposal as a dilemma between losing the United States as an ally and acquiescing to Russian demands. He seemed to suggest that the United States had threatened to withhold what assistance it still provided, which was mostly limited to intelligence sharing.\n\n“Now is one of the most difficult moments in our history,” Mr. Zelensky said. “Now Ukraine may face a very difficult choice: either loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.”\n\nUkraine would have to accept concessions, he said, or face “an extremely difficult winter, the most difficult, and further risks.”\n\nMr. Zelensky said of the United States, “They will expect an answer from us.” He said that he would adhere to Ukraine’s constitution and would “offer alternatives,” and that Ukraine should not be cast as shunning diplomacy to end the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader responded to the increasing pressure by turning, as he has before, to European allies. He held a conference call with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain. In a statement, Mr. Zelensky said that Ukraine would coordinate its next moves with the European leaders.\n\nHow effectively Mr. Zelensky can negotiate with the Trump administration will largely depend on how much continued European support he can muster.\n\nHis outreach repeats a playbook that kept him in the game with the Trump administration’s negotiating tactics at earlier moments of tension. When called on, Ukraine’s allies in Europe, alarmed by the potential security threats to their countries of a Russian victory in the war, have provided backup.\n\nEuropean leaders embraced Mr. Zelensky after President Trump lit into him at an Oval Office meeting in February. They negotiated to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine after the Trump administration closed the spigot of military aid. And European leaders flew to Washington to support Mr. Zelensky after a summit in August between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, another moment that raised fears that the Trump administration and the Kremlin were moving to impose unfavorable terms on Kyiv.\n\nThe 28-point document now being pushed by the White House was negotiated between Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s envoy for peace missions, and a Russian official, Kirill Dmitriev. In a radio interview on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he wanted a response from Mr. Zelensky by Thursday, but that the deadline could be extended “if things are working well.”\n\nUkraine and Europe have said they had no input in the proposal, and European foreign ministers voiced outrage over the plan, saying it would weaken Ukraine’s long-term security.\n\nAccording to a draft posted online by a Ukrainian lawmaker, the proposal would require Ukraine to change its constitution to prohibit any effort to join NATO. It would force Kyiv to recognize Russian control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, parts of which Ukraine still holds. And it would cap the size of the Ukrainian Army at 600,000, down from an estimated current strength of more than 800,000.\n\nThe proposal would also bar the presence of NATO troops inside Ukraine, which would derail a European plan to help ensure the country’s postwar security.\n\nIf Ukraine agrees to end the war, the proposal says, it would be given frozen Russian assets to help pay for its reconstruction. Kyiv would also receive what the plan calls reliable security guarantees, promising a military response if Russia invaded again but offering few details.\n\nIf Moscow were to invade again, the proposal says, sanctions would be reinstated and Moscow would lose benefits included in the agreement. Those sweeteners include major Russian goals like readmittance to the Group of 8, reintegration into the global economy and joint investment opportunities with the United States.\n\nThe proposal comes as Mr. Zelensky’s government has been weakened by a sweeping corruption scandal implicating ministers and associates of the president. They are accused of taking millions of dollars in kickbacks from the state-owned nuclear energy company.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine is under growing pressure on the battlefield. Its army is short of soldiers, leaving gaps on the front line that Russia has exploited for small advances. And Kyiv is facing increasing financial strain, with a European plan to finance next year’s budget through loans linked to frozen Russian funds now in doubt.\n\nThere is rising support within Ukraine for a peace deal, after years in which Ukrainians mostly seethed at Russia’s invasion and opposed any concessions. Support for a negotiated settlement has grown from 10 percent in 2022, the first year of the war, to 74 percent today, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.\n\nIn Russia, the government has said little about the 28-point plan. But the Kremlin hardened its tone toward Ukraine on Friday, warning that Kyiv must enter into negotiations “now rather than later” or face losing more territory.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, said that Mr. Zelensky’s “room for maneuver regarding decision-making is shrinking as territories are lost during the offensive actions” of the Russian Army.\n\n“Continuing is senseless and dangerous for them,” Mr. Peskov added, referring to the Ukrainian leadership.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Putin took the opportunity to emphasize that Russia was making progress on the battlefield, donning fatigues at a command post. At a security council meeting in the Kremlin on Friday, Mr. Putin said that Russia was ready either to discuss the U.S.-backed plan or continue fighting.\n\nUkrainian commentators suggested that Russia was pressing the settlement proposal now to exploit Mr. Zelensky’s vulnerability from the corruption accusations and to delay any decision by Europe on the frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe talks that led to the 28-point plan are taking place outside traditional channels for both the Americans and the Russians. Diplomatic ties became strained last month when the United States canceled a proposed summit in Hungary between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, seeing little sign that Russia was willing to compromise.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Witkoff, the real estate developer turned top negotiator for Mr. Trump, worked on the 28 points with Mr. Dmitriev, a longtime Putin ally and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nMr. Dmitriev’s role in Ukraine talks had originally been limited to negotiating possible U.S.-Russian business and economic deals. Now Mr. Dmitriev appears to have veered into the center of peace negotiations.\n\nThe terms of the settlement proposal require many steps beyond Ukraine’s control.\n\nThe settlement envisions a halt to NATO expansion, ending a long policy of an open door at the alliance, as well as Russia’s acceptance into the G8, a club of wealthy democracies, from which it was expelled after annexing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe agreement would require $100 billion in frozen Russian assets to be spent on U.S.-led reconstruction in Ukraine, with half of the profits given to America. A separate fund would be reserved for U.S.-Russian joint ventures.\n\nUkraine would withdraw from territory it controls in the Donetsk region, including the fortress cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, and the area would become a demilitarized zone.\n\nThe proposal would also require amnesties for crimes committed during the war. Ukraine has opened thousands of war crimes investigations, including over well-documented mass killings and torture in occupied areas.\n\nAs Mr. Zelensky prepared to negotiate over the plan’s terms, it was unclear whether Russia was willing to do the same.\n\n“If it’s treated as a framework for a negotiation, on which the outcome of these issues is not predetermined, then it could move us in some direction,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist and Russia specialist at the RAND Corporation.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/business/french-brands-sue-shein.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"14:02:33-05:00","title":"Thousands of French Brands Sue Shein, Accusing It of Unfair Competition","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A coalition of 12 retail federations and 100 major French brands, including Carrefour and Promod, has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Chinese fast fashion retailer Shein, accusing it of unfair competition over the past five years.

Competition\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T14:02:33-05:00\n\nA coalition of thousands of French retailers has sued the Chinese fast fashion retailer Shein, accusing it of unfair competition, according to the French Retail Council, a move that escalated a backlash against the company in France this week.\n\nThe class action suit, filed on Wednesday in a commercial court in southern France, was brought on by 12 federations and 100 large French brands. It accuses the company of poaching consumers over the last five years by using false promotions to entice shoppers and selling items that failed to comply with French consumer and safety standards. The companies are seeking up to 3 billion euros in damages for economic harm.\n\n“This unfair competition represents a systemic threat to our businesses,” said Bernard Cherqui, the president of the French retail federation. “We are facing an extremely powerful organization.”\n\nShein did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement to Agence-France Presse, the company said the accusation was “unfounded,” adding that it was “regrettable that these actors are prioritizing legal confrontation over constructive dialogue.”\n\nShein was already facing an investigation by the French government after an inquiry earlier this month found that “childlike” sex dolls and certain categories of weapons were being sold on the company’s French marketplace platform, stoking nationwide furor. Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu ordered authorities to shut down access to Shein’s website for two days, during which customs agents blocked Shein packages at Charles de Gaulle airport for inspections.\n\nEighty percent of the 200,000 packages searched were found to be noncompliant with French and European regulatory standards. Those items will be used in a body of evidence at a hearing scheduled for next week at the Paris Judicial Court, which will rule on a government request to suspend Shein’s platform in France.\n\nShein previously said it had immediately removed all illegal items from its French website, including dolls the size of little girls that the nation’s consumer fraud agency said were of a “child pornography nature.”\n\nThe French government has asked the European Union to open an investigation into the Chinese e-commerce site, saying the platform is also in breach of European rules. Last week, European regulators announced that a tax would be imposed on small parcels arriving in the European Union starting in January, a move that will especially hit Shein and Temu, another Chinese online retailer.\n\nThe separate lawsuit brought this week by French retailers adds to the momentum against the Chinese online giant, which gained steam shortly after it opened its first physical store in November in Paris. Following raucous street protests, plans to open more Shein outlets in France have been delayed.\n\nThe lawsuit involves an unexpected coalition of French department stores and clothing brands, mass-market retailers and online shops. The French supermarket giant Carrefour and fashion brand Promod were among the 100 brands joining to seek compensation for what they say are damages suffered in the last half-decade from unfair competition by Shein.\n\n"}]}
