But it was still remarkable – especially coming from Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Reporters kept peppering the two men with questions pointing to their differences and the awful things they’d said about one another.\n \n\n   \n  But the two kept batting away the chance to throw down, emphasizing their common ground.\n \n\n   \n  Among Trump’s comments:\n \n\n   \n  When a reporter noted Trump had threatened to cut funding to New York City if Mamdani were elected, the president suggested that he’ll play that card if he needs to. But he also downplayed the possibility.\n \n\n   \n  “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  The compliments were largely flowing from Trump to Mamdani. But Mamdani clearly held his fire on Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than litigate differences with Trump, he regularly brought things right back to his pet issue: affordability.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about having said the US government was complicit in an alleged Israeli genocide in Gaza, Mamdani didn’t back away, but he quickly pivoted to affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Towards the end, a reporter asked if New York City loved Trump. Mamdani wouldn’t go that far, but he did do Trump a solid.\n \n\n   \n  “I can tell you that there were more New Yorkers who voted for President Trump in the most recent presidential election because of that focus on cost of living,” Mamdani said, “and I’m looking forward to working together to deliver on that affordability agenda.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump kept playing defense for Mamdani\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t just that the two men said nice things about one another. It almost seemed like Trump was playing defense for his new buddy.\n \n\n   \n  When a reporter asked Mamdani about having previously labeled Trump a “fascist,” Trump basically gave him permission to say such things.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s ok. You can just say yes,” Trump said. “That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining.”\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, when it was noted that Mamdani had called Trump a despot, Trump volunteered: “I’ve been called much worse than a despot.”\n \n\n   \n  When a reporter asked about Mamdani having criticized Trump’s deportation operations, Trump suggested it wasn’t a big part of their conversation. This despite deportations having been perhaps Trump’s overriding concern in New York City for much of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “He doesn’t want to see crime, and I don’t want to see crime,” Trump said. “And I have very little doubt that we’re not gonna get along on that issue.”\n \n\n   \n    Game recognizes game\n \n\n   \n  So why the love fest?\n \n\n   \n  It seems to have boiled down to something we’ve seen with Trump before. Even when he disagrees with somebody politically, he seems to respect political fortitude and winners. And right now, Mamdani is a winner.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani is also clearly a gifted politician who is succeeding in an area of the country that Trump holds near and dear. That Trump would appreciate a good-looking, talented pol from Queens probably shouldn’t be too shocking.\n \n\n   \n  And to the extent there was a political calculation here, it’s possible the White House didn’t really want to get into it with Mamdani right now. After all, this is a candidate who was so successful on precisely the issue on which Trump is really struggling right now: affordability and cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Maybe getting into it with Mamdani – knowing Mamdani has such message discipline – was deemed a risk.\n \n\n   \n    But Trump undercut a major GOP strategy\n \n\n   \n  But the buddy-buddy scene does come at a potential cost politically.\n \n\n   \n  The scene was a far cry from what many anticipated – and how Republicans billed the event.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday, “because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance joked that he “might have a stomach bug” to avoid meeting Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida late Friday morning called Mamdani a “literal communist” and predicted he was “ on his way to the White House to be schooled by President Trump .”\n \n\n   \n  Or not.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, it’s interesting that this is not at all what we got. But it’s also rather puzzling.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Republicans have spent weeks and  even months  suggesting they were preparing to tie Democrats far and wide to Mamdani’s politics. Democrats also seemed to fear this, judging by how reluctant some of them were to endorse him.\n \n\n   \n  This was the GOP’s first big opportunity to drive that message – to set up this contrast between Trump’s agenda and the purported communism that has infected the national Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  Trump trampled all over that strategy.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the GOP will abandon it outright, but it kind of undercuts it when you’ve got Trump on video next to Mamdani emphasizing their common ground and suggesting conservatives might be pleasantly surprised by the guy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump even rejected a common GOP attack line that Mamdani is a “jihadist.” He was asked if he agreed with New York GOP gubernatorial candidate  Rep. Elise Stefanik saying that , and he said, “No, I don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  “She’s out there campaigning,” Trump said, “and you say things sometimes in a campaign.”\n \n\n   \n  It seems Trump doesn’t want everyone to take the GOP’s attacks on Mamdani that seriously.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the most interesting question now is whether any conservatives criticize Trump for giving this supposed communist jihadist a total and complete pass.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/ukraine-war-trump-plan-zelensky-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump gives Ukraine days to accept his plan to end war as Zelensky warns of ‘difficult moment in history’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has set a deadline for Ukraine to accept his 28-point peace plan, which includes concessions such as recognizing Russian-occupied territories, limiting Ukraine’s military to 600,000 troops, and banning Ukrainian NATO membership.

in history’ \n       \n  By Svitlana Vlasova, Catherine Nicholls and Kara Fox, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:17 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his plan – widely seen as favoring Russia – to end the war, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country faced “one of the most difficult moments” in its history.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines. But Thursday is it,” the president said in a radio interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan put forward by Trump  puts pressure  on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands.\n \n\n   \n  It was characterized by Zelensky during a video address to the nation on Friday as presenting Ukraine with a choice between losing its dignity or a key ally.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from the Oval later in the day, Trump said he was confident the plan was a “way of getting peace” but said it still needed Zelensky’s approval. However, he suggested Zelensky had little choice but to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “He’ll have to like it. And if he doesn’t like it then they should just keep fighting I guess,” Trump told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a security council briefing he had received the US proposal and that he believed it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian president said he was ready to “show the flexibility” that was agreed upon during the  summit  with Trump in Alaska this August, but added that Russia had not “substantively” discussed the deal with the US.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A very difficult choice’\n \n\n   \n  In his video address, Zelensky said, “The pressure on Ukraine is now at its most intense. Ukraine may now face a very difficult choice: either the loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner, or 28 difficult points, or an extremely harsh winter.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine would “work calmly” and quickly with the US and its partners towards an end to the war, Zelensky said. Zelensky spoke with US Vice President JD Vance on Friday about the plan.\n \n\n   \n  A number of European leaders have spoken out in support of Ukraine since the details of Trump’s proposal were released, vowing to stand by Kyiv and insisting that no decisions should be made about the fate of the country without its input.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the EU appears to have been left largely out in the cold, though German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he and Trump discussed the US plan in a phone call Friday and “agreed on the next steps at the advisers’ level.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint call with Zelensky earlier Friday, Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer “agreed to continue to pursue the goal of safeguarding vital European and Ukrainian interests in the long term,” according to the German government.\n \n\n   \n  This includes “ensuring that the line of contact is the starting point for an understanding and that the Ukrainian armed forces remain capable of effectively defending Ukraine’s sovereignty,” it said in a statement, differing from the US proposal which calls for Ukraine to withdraw from some of its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a  post on X  that European leaders would meet on Saturday on the margins of the G20 summit in Johannesburg to discuss the proposal.\n \n\n   \n  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the discussion at G20 would focus on “how we can strengthen this plan for the next phase of negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is only one country around the G20 table that is not calling for a ceasefire, and one country that is deploying a barrage of drones and missiles to destroy livelihoods and murder innocent civilians,” Starmer said. “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”\n \n\n   \n    Zelensky: I will not betray Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears to be giving Russia  almost everything it wants , with much of the text resembling the maximalist positions Moscow held during talks in Istanbul in 2022, shortly after the invasion and when its forces held more of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Like the proposal the Trump administration crafted which led to the  ceasefire in Gaza , the Ukraine  plan  reads as bullet-pointed list, laying out commitments each side would make in order to drive a lasting end to the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukraine plan – which has been seen by CNN – calls for a halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by the US president. The draft plan’s veracity was confirmed by a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the ideas put forward in the 28-point plan have been rejected in previous negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  The plan would have Russia-occupied Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States,” a previous red line for Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of eastern Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.”\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel and calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days – something that would be extremely challenging to organize.\n \n\n   \n  It also outlines a return of Russia into the global economy, including the lifting of sanctions and an invitation to rejoin the G8.\n \n\n   \n  In the Fox News interview on Friday, Trump said that Putin is “not looking for more war” and is “taking punishment,” despite the plan appearing to offer major concessions to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said that he would work around the clock to find a path forward on the plan, while saying he would not betray his country.\n \n\n   \n  “I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will offer alternatives, but we will definitely not give the enemy any reason to say that Ukraine does not want peace, that it is disrupting the process, and that Ukraine is not ready for diplomacy,” Zelensky continued.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.

Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday that she will be resigning from office in January, stunning some in her own party after a shocking, monthslong political pivot that catapulted her from one of President Donald Trump’s closest allies to one of his top antagonists.\n \n\n   \n  Greene dropped the news in a  post on social media  just days after her public falling out with Trump, who called her a “traitor” and said he’d support a GOP challenge to her House seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  In her statement, Greene said she wanted to avoid a nasty primary — while predicting that the GOP would lose its House majority in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “I have too much self-respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms,” Greene said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to step down will cap a turbulent five-year career in Washington, during which Greene was publicly condemned for violent rhetoric on the House floor and  booted  from the hard-right Freedom Caucus over a feud with a fellow Republican — while wielding extraordinary influence in her party as one of Trump’s most trusted political allies on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since Trump’s “traitor” comments, Greene faced direct threats against her life, the congresswoman  said in an interview with CNN . In the same interview, the conservative firebrand apologized for her own years of “toxic” rhetoric — comments that reverberated around the country amid an increasingly violent political culture.\n \n\n   \n  Greene had been contemplating her resignation for over a week, according to a person close to her, as the threats against her continued to escalate amid her falling out with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Her next steps remain unclear. But the Georgia congresswoman, who just months earlier had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state’s high-stakes Senate race, currently has no plans to run for any office, the person added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Greene criticized the president for being too focused on foreign policy and not doing enough with his domestic agenda at home — going as far as to side with Democrats over the contentious issue of costly enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire next month.\n \n\n   \n  Greene also became one of the White House’s most vocal critics of the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. She and fellow Republican Rep. Thomas Massie accused the White House of attempting to conceal details of the files. Following fierce resistance, Trump ultimately signed an Epstein transparency measure into law earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very sad for our country but so happy for my friend Marjorie.

Washington resident died of complications from an infection with a bird flu strain never before reported in humans, the state Department of Health said on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The patient was an older adult with underlying health conditions who had been hospitalized and undergoing treatment for infection with H5N5 avian influenza.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months and only the second reported human death from the virus in the United States, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.\n \n\n   \n  Officials continue to monitor others who were in close contact with the person, but no one else has tested positive for bird flu, and no evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.\n \n\n   \n  “The person had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds,” the Washington State Department of Health said in  a statement . “DOH sampling identified avian influenza virus in the environment of the flock, making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.”\n \n\n   \n  Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.\n \n\n   \n  Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the outbreak, according to the CDC. Another elderly person with underlying conditions died in January after a bird flu infection.\n \n\n   \n  Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.  Officials also advise using caution when cleaning bird feeders or other areas exposed to bird feces. Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington health department also recommends flu shots for anyone who may come into contact with domestic or wild birds. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-guidance","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:32:00-05:00","title":"RFK Jr. says he personally directed CDC’s new guidance on vaccines and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Health Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy Jr.  personally directed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  update its website  to contradict its longtime guidance that vaccines don’t cause autism, he told The New York Times in an  interview  published Friday.\n \n\n   \n  His comments provide clarity into who directed the CDC’s website change, after many current and former staffers at the agency were surprised to see new published guidance on Wednesday that defies scientific consensus. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has upended the public health agencies he oversees and pushed for and enacted changes that have unsettled much of the medical community, which sees his policies as harmful for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “The whole thing about ‘vaccines have been tested and there’s been this determination made,’ is just a lie,” Kennedy said in the interview, which was conducted Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC’s “vaccine safety” page now claims that the statement “vaccines do not cause autism” is not based on evidence because it doesn’t rule out the possibility that infant vaccines are linked to the disorder. The page also has been updated to suggest that health officials have ignored studies showing a potential link.\n \n\n   \n  Public health researchers and advocates strongly refute the updated website, saying it misleads the public by exploiting the fact that the scientific method can’t satisfy a demand to prove a negative. They note that scientists have thoroughly explored potential links between vaccines and autism in rigorous research spanning decades, all pointing to the same conclusion that vaccines don’t cause autism.\n \n\n   \n  “No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Thursday. “This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines. All this research has determined that there is no link between autism and vaccines.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement, acknowledged to The New York Times the existence of studies showing no link to autism from the mercury-based preservative thimerosal or from the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. But he told the newspaper there are still gaps in vaccine safety science and a need for more research.\n \n\n   \n  The move creates another disagreement between the health secretary and Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee. During his confirmation process, Kennedy pledged to Cassidy he would leave the statement that vaccines do not cause autism on the CDC website. The statement remains on the website but with a disclaimer that it was left there because of their agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy told The New York Times he talked to Cassidy about the updated website and that Cassidy disagreed with the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism,” Cassidy posted on X on Thursday. “Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n \n\n   \n  The updated website comes as Kennedy has taken  other steps  as health secretary that sow doubt in immunizations. He has  pulled $500 million for their development , ousted and replaced every member of a federal  vaccine advisory committee  and  pledged to overhaul a federal program  for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also  fired former CDC Director Susan Monarez  less than a month into her tenure after they clashed over vaccine policy.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Sean O’Leary, head of the infectious diseases committee at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told reporters in a briefing Thursday that the CDC’s website update was perpetuating a lie.\n \n\n   \n  “This is madness,” he said. “Vaccines do not cause autism, and unfortunately, we can no longer trust health-related information coming from our government.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Health and Human Services, which didn’t make Kennedy available for an interview with The Associated Press this week, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/marimar-martinez-shooting-case-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:56:00-20:56","title":"Text messages and a moved SUV: How the government’s case against a Chicago woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apart","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marimar Martinez, a U.S. citizen and teaching assistant, was charged with assaulting a Customs and Border Protection agent, Charles Exum, during protests against immigration crackdowns in Chicago as part of Operation Midway Blitz.

woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apart \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Omar Jimenez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Even with a federal indictment hanging over her, claiming she had been a threat to law enforcement, Marimar Martinez was confident she could eventually prove her innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the truth,” Martinez told CNN Friday in an exclusive interview. “I know what really happened that day.”\n \n\n   \n  After an  extraordinary reversal by federal prosecutors  in one of the most high-profile cases connected to  Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago , a judge dismissed charges Thursday against Martinez, a United States citizen who was accused of ramming the vehicle of a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago before he shot her several times.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling from US District Judge Georgia Alexakis came after she repeatedly raised concerns about the handling of the investigation, including the revelation the vehicle of the Border Patrol agent who shot Martinez was moved  1,000 miles away  after the incident and text messages showing the agent  apparently bragging  about the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been  accused  of “aggressively and erratically” pursuing CBP agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city. The charging complaint says Exum then stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez – shots the Department of Homeland Security called “defensive.” Martinez had pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the courtroom, the judge noted the government’s case included omissions  that caused her to tread carefully  as Martinez’s defense attorney alleged it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Outside the courtroom, the high-profile case garnered public scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Christopher Parente – himself a former federal prosecutor – believes a rush by the Trump administration to have a meme-ready example of dangerous protest activity forced the US Attorney’s Office to push a weak case too far.\n \n\n   \n  “She never would have been charged under the old system because they would have found out right away that this case is garbage,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s decision came hours after federal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charges against both Martinez and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz.\n \n\n   \n  The US Attorney’s Office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz,” spokesperson Joseph Fitzpatrick said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente commended the Trump-appointed US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Andrew Boutros, for not moving forward with the case despite what was likely enormous pressure.\n \n\n   \n  “That took incredible guts,” Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts told CNN the move was likely the result of a series of questionable claims from the federal government in court and a calculation over whether it can be proven at trial that the gunshots were justified.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers’ narratives,” CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the investigation and how experts say the government’s case fell apart:\n \n\n   \n    Apparent bragging text messages provide insight\n \n\n   \n  Text messages displayed in court earlier this month were likely key in the prosecution’s decision to move to dismiss charges, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Exum appeared to brag to fellow agents about his marksmanship after he repeatedly shot Martinez following a collision between their vehicles, the messages revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Boasting about the shots would look bad to a jury, Jackson said. Had the case moved forward, the government would have needed to justify every shot he took and prove there was immediate danger and proportionate force.\n \n\n   \n  Exum sent an  article from The Guardian  on October 7 to a group of other agents, which quoted Parente saying Martinez had “seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum said in the next text.\n \n\n   \n  Parente pointed to the messages as an indication Exum understood the high public scrutiny of the case.\n \n\n   \n  When Parente pressed him in court on what he meant, Exum responded he was a firearms instructor. He said, “I take pride in my shooting skills.”\n \n\n   \n  Another message to the group read, “I have a MOF amendment to add to my story. I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge MOF is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one up someone wherever possible. It’s unclear what exactly he was responding to because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Parente told CNN he believes most federal agents would be embarrassed to see that kind of bragging about a shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I have never come across an agent like that,” Parente said. “Those people go to work, and they try to do the right thing. They do not want to shoot people ever.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the texts “reflect poorly on the agent,” who would be a key witness at trial. Prosecutors also have to consider the fairness of the case. “Here you have a woman who was shot multiple times, and there were serious questions of whether she had done anything wrong whatsoever,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  If the case had moved forward, it likely   would have been unsuccessful, Jackson said. Martinez’s attorney agrees.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no way we were going to lose this trial on the evidence,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Key evidence was moved 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  Hearings in the case included discussion on what the government did with Exum’s car following the collision. The way that piece of key evidence was handled was one of the significant problems with the government’s case, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s defense attorney sought to prove his claim  the government potentially destroyed evidence  when it released Exum’s damaged vehicle and allowed the agent to drive it more than 1,000 miles to his home state of Maine, where the car may have had repairs.\n \n\n   \n  “That means that the government did not properly handle and maintain evidence. That’s a major problem in the presentation of the case,” Honig said. It needed to be preserved in the exact same condition it was in after the collision, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said it was a major misstep for the federal government that undermined their credibility. In every other case he’s seen where a car was involved in a shooting, the car is taken to be analyzed by law enforcement and experts reconstruct the collision.\n \n\n   \n  “Any evaluation of the trajectory of the damage would go to show what happened. Instead, you take the car away and destroy evidence,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Alexakis expressed skepticism over why Martinez’s car had been kept in Chicago as evidence while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally. “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n  But Alexakis said the government clearly believed the vehicle could be exculpatory evidence; otherwise, it would not have gone through the trouble to preserve records on the car.\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis ordered the government last month to return the SUV to Chicago.\n \n\n   \n    Judge questioned government’s narrative\n \n\n   \n  Of more than two dozen people arrested for impeding or assaulting federal officers or other protest-related offenses amid demonstrations over the federal immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, none have gone to trial and charges have been dropped against at least nine of them, The  Associated Press  reported. Judges have expressed skepticism over the strength of some cases.\n \n\n   \n  In its initial  press release , the Department of Homeland Security had referred to Martinez and her co-defendant as “domestic terrorists” who had “ambushed” the Border Patrol vehicle on Chicago streets. Martinez says she couldn’t believe the accusations she was facing.\n \n\n   \n  “They were (saying) ‘domestic terrorist,’ that she had a semiautomatic. I was just like, that’s crazy,” Martinez told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In court, Alexakis noted ﻿discrepancies in the government’s case have caused her “to question the narrative being put forward.”\n \n\n   \n  She pointed out the Justice Department had previously said in court the agent took the SUV back to Maine because it was his “personal vehicle,” then stated in a later court filing the car is part of an official Border Patrol fleet.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted she had not previously been told a mechanic had worked on the car, and the government has given at least two different accounts of who approved the car’s removal to Maine.\n \n\n   \n  She acknowledged the government version of events may turn out to be true, “but I can’t accept that possibility at this juncture,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There have been serious questions raised about the truthfulness of the statements made by the Border Patrol agent who shot Ms. Martinez and …about the extent to which she could get a fair trial when the Department of Homeland Security was using her case to make inflammatory public claims about the level of resistance to Operation Midway Blitz,” Northwestern law professor Paul Gowder told CNN. “Dismissing the case was the right thing to do with that kind of cloud over it.”\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Thursday restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the DOJ for further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Along with the physical scars that wrapped around Martinez from her arms to her legs, the mental trauma is another reminder of that painful day, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a survivor,” Martinez said. “I don’t want to remember that day. You’re laying there at night and you’re just thinking about it, like, ‘what’s gonna happen?’ It’s really emotional to me.”\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, who works as a teaching assistant, says she now wants to put the case behind her and get back to work.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just so excited to go back with my students, the parents. They were so supportive,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez says she will be happy to get her normal life back.\n \n\n   \n  “People are like, ‘oh, you just want to be the victim,’” she said. “I’m not the victim. I’m actually a survivor from all of this injustice that’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/americas/faa-warning-venezuela-flights-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"21:00:00-05:00","title":"US Warns Airlines of Potential Hazards When Flying Over Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Federal Aviation Administration has issued a formal advisory warning major airlines about potential hazards when flying over Venezuela, citing deteriorating security, increased military activity, and GNSS interference.

affordability issues, love of New York and winning in collegial Oval Office meeting \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:47 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani  was pressed Friday  on whether he believes President Donald Trump is a fascist.\n \n\n   \n  Standing beside his host in the Oval Office, Mamdani began to answer – until the president, seated, interrupted.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s OK – you can just say yes. That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining,” Trump told his guest, laughing it off as he playfully tapped Mamdani on the arm.\n \n\n   \n   That collegial interaction  was nearly unthinkable in the lead-up to the meeting as both sides postured, but the leader of the MAGA movement and the self-described democratic socialist made clear their conversation was a productive one – friendly, even.\n \n\n   \n  “The better he does, the happier I am,” Trump said of the mayor-elect, later expressing openness to living in Mamdani’s New York City.\n \n\n   \n  During the mayoral campaign, the president urged voters in his native city to back Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, over the GOP nominee, because he’d have a better shot at defeating Mamdani. The president had threatened to pull federal funding from New York if Mamdani won, suggested openness to sending in the National Guard and threatened to arrest the mayor-elect, whom he’s repeatedly called him a “communist.” (Mamdani  has said  he is not a communist).\n \n\n   \n  But asked Friday if he would feel comfortable living in New York City, Trump said, “I really would – especially after the meeting, absolutely,” adding, “We agree on a lot more than I really thought.”\n \n\n   \n  Their post-meeting press engagement underscored that both Trump and Mamdani recognize the political utility of each other’s strengths, with each citing the New York City crossover voters who backed Mamdani earlier this month and Trump in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Trump signaled respect for Mamdani’s overwhelming victory – he won more than 50% of the vote – built on a focus on working-class issues and promises to restore affordability to the nation’s most populous city. That’s a topic where the president could use a boost – a  Fox News poll  released this week showed 76% of voters have a negative view of the economy, a finding that sends loud warning signs to Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also in Mamdani’s best interests to have a working relationship with the White House. New York City’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget is counting on $7.4 billion in federal funding,  according to  the state comptroller.\n \n\n   \n  Along with affordability, Trump and Mamdani indicated they were able to find common ground on issues like energy costs, public safety and peace in the Middle East – a softening, rhetorically at least, of their division over immigration enforcement and the Israel-Hamas war.\n \n\n   \n  The stagecraft of the meeting was notable – Trump and Mamdani met privately for just over half an hour before reporters were invited into the Oval Office. During that time, Mamdani said, the two admired a portrait of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the Cabinet Room, with Mamdani taking a picture next to it.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other meetings with his global counterparts where the two leaders sit on equal footing in cushioned yellow chairs, Trump sat behind his desk as Mamdani stood up, positioned slightly behind him.\n \n\n   \n  But the two were all smiles throughout, with Trump even siding with the soon-to-be first Muslim mayor of New York over one of his GOP allies, Rep. Elise Stefanik, who’d called Mamdani a “jihadist.”\n \n\n   \n  “She’s out there campaigning and you say things sometimes in a campaign,” Trump said of Stefanik, who’s running for governor of New York. “I met with a man who’s a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see New York be great again.”\n \n\n   \n  Stefanik responded  soon after on X : “We all want NYC to succeed. But we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the meeting, Mamdani sought counsel from other top Democratic officials who have navigated their own relationships with Trump, spending Thursday holding calls with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the Rev. Al Sharpton to discuss how to approach it and how best to communicate with Trump, according to an aide to Mamdani’s transition team.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s meeting, Mamdani said, “focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump expressed confidence that Mamdani can do a good job as he prepares to take office on January 1 – and impress across the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/africa/students-kidnapped-nigerian-catholic-school-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:57:00-05:00","title":"Nigeria school attacks: 215 students kidnapped from Catholic school amid outrage over violence against Christians","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Nigeria’s Niger State, armed bandits abducted 215 students and 12 teachers from St. Mary’s Catholic School, sparking outrage over rising religious violence targeting Christians.

designation for Maduro, US military performs large ‘attack demo’ near Venezuela \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Avery Schmitz, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:59 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military conducted its largest show of force to date near Venezuela on Thursday, ahead of a key Monday deadline that will see the US designate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  The designation of “Cartel de los Soles,” a phrase that experts say is more  a description of allegedly corrupt government officials  than an organized crime group, as a foreign terrorist organization will authorize President Donald Trump to impose fresh sanctions. It doesn’t, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts.\n \n\n   \n  Still, administration officials have been making the case that the terrorist designation will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “It gives more tools to our department to give options to the President,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  While the US has been accumulating military assets in the region, Trump has suggested he may still be open to a diplomatic solution, though to date there have been no public indications of progress toward deescalation.\n \n\n   \n  In the largest military display near Venezuela since the US began threatening military action, at least six US aircraft appeared off the coast of Venezuela on Thursday over the course of several hours, including a supersonic F/A-18E fighter jet, a B-52 strategic bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, according to a CNN review of open-source flight data.\n \n\n   \n  A statement  posted  by the United States Air Forces Southern Command on Friday characterized the drill as a “bomber attack demo” to deter illicit trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The F/A-18E flew from the USS Gerald Ford, which arrived in the Caribbean earlier this week. An RC-135 Rivet Joint reconnaissance plane, equipped with signals intelligence capabilities, also appeared circling in “racetrack” loops near Venezuela’s eastern border.\n \n\n   \n  That show of force happened hours before Trump told Fox News on Friday that he would be speaking to Maduro “in the not-too-distant future.”\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t tell you what I’m going to tell him, but I have something very specific to say,” he said.  Earlier in the week Trump had publicly suggested that he was open to talks, though it’s unclear when the two leaders may connect.\n \n\n   \n  Ric Grenell, a Trump special envoy, had been leading dialogue with the Maduro regime earlier this year. But the White House called off those discussions last month as the US military continued to amass a large footprint in the region, according to a source.\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, the Qataris had passed messages and facilitated discussions between the US and the Maduro regime, but they have not been asked to serve in that role in recent months, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration could turn to other countries that have contact with the Maduro regime, but so far it appears that they have not asked another country to send messages to the regime on their behalf, based on discussions with diplomats in countries that currently maintain dialogue with the regime.\n \n\n   \n  The designation of “Cartel de los Soles” only furthers the pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has named as the leader of that group. The label is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism tools.\n \n\n   \n  It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US. The Trump administration notified Congress on November 16 that it would apply the designation to “Cartel de los Soles” starting a countdown to Monday for lawmakers to object, though Congress has not taken action to block the move.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has been conducting training missions near Venezuela in the air and at sea for several weeks adding pressure to Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  The missions, which began in mid-October, have been carried out by both B-52s and supersonic B-1 heavy bombers, inching closer to the Venezuelan coastline each time. The flights have been concentrated north of Caracas and Isla Margarita, an island retreat where Venezuelan military forces trained for amphibious operations last month.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was also briefed repeatedly earlier this month on options for attacking Venezuelan military and government facilities directly,  CNN has reported .\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Isa Cardona contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/asia/bangladesh-india-sheikh-hasina-death-sentence-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:01:00-05:00","title":"Bangladesh Plans to Execute Former Leader; India Blocks Extradition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh and daughter of the nation’s founding leader, has been sentenced to death by Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal for crimes against humanity, including ordering the violent suppression of student protests in 2024.

There’s one big thing in the way: India \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:01 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  She was once cast as a secular heroine, the daughter of a revolutionary leader, whose brutal assassination in the 1970s defined her political ascent.\n \n\n   \n  But Sheikh Hasina’s rise to the top of Bangladesh’s politics preceded a stunning fall from power to self-exile in India.\n \n\n   \n  A death sentence delivered in absentia could now see her executed – if New Delhi decides to send her back.\n \n\n   \n  The ousted leader was found guilty of crimes against humanity for the violent suppression of student protests that toppled her regime in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  She fled to India last August after 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule, seeking refuge in the capital of one of her closest allies.\n \n\n   \n  Now she’s become a pawn in a tense standoff between the two countries as Dhaka demands her extradition to face justice for crimes that she insists she did not commit.\n \n\n   \n  “She had to flee the country to flee the rage of the people,” said Bangladeshi political scientist Mubashar Hasan. “Hiding in India and handed down a death penalty. It’s quite an extraordinary story.”\n \n\n   \n    A violent past\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s political journey is a story of Shakespearean proportions – a saga of tragedy, exile and power inextricably linked to the history of her home country.\n \n\n   \n  The eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the charismatic “Father of the Nation,” she was thrust into politics early in life as she witnessed Bangladesh’s struggle for autonomy from Pakistan. But it was a single, bloody night in August 1975 that truly forged her path.\n \n\n   \n  In a brutal military coup, army officers assassinated her father, her mother, and three of her brothers in their Dhaka home. Hasina and her sister survived as they were visiting West Germany at the time.\n \n\n   \n  In the chaotic aftermath, Gen. Ziaur Rahman – the husband of her future arch-nemesis, Khaleda Zia – rose to power, his regime passing a law that would protect Mujibur’s assassins for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight, Hasina’s life was transformed, and she was forced into six years of exile in India, which imprinted a deep respect for the Indian state on the future leader.\n \n\n   \n  When she finally returned to Bangladesh in 1981, it was to a nation clamoring for its founding ideals of secularism. But she also entered a political arena about to be defined by another woman pushed into tragedy: Zia, whose husband had himself been assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  Recalling the day of her return from forced exile, Hasina  said : “When I landed at the airport, I didn’t get anyone of my (relatives) but received love of millions of people, and that was my only strength.”\n \n\n   \n  Thus began the era of the “Battling Begums” – a deeply personal, yet destructive duel between two women that would grip Bangladesh for the next 30 years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘She had to flee’\n \n\n   \n  Taking the helm of her father’s Awami League, Hasina embarked on a long journey through the political wilderness, navigating house arrests and crackdowns amid a growing rivalry with Zia. In 1996, Hasina led her party to electoral victory, becoming Prime Minister for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Her first act in office was to announce the prosecution of those involved in the 1975 coup and murders of her family, finally beginning a quest for justice.\n \n\n   \n  A secular Muslim, Hasina served for one term, losing the next election to Zia. But when she returned to power in 2008, she was seen as a changed leader – someone more resolute, less trusting and determined to permanently secure her position.\n \n\n   \n  For the next 15 years, she ruled Bangladesh with an increasingly iron fist, ushering an era of strong economic growth. At the same time, she gave India crucial support, bolstering New Delhi through economic and security deals in a neighborhood that includes adversaries Pakistan and China.\n \n\n   \n  But Bangladesh’s developmental success came at a steep price: human rights organizations warned that she and her government were headed toward a one-party system. Critics expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, voter intimidation, and harassment of the media and opposition figures.\n \n\n   \n  As the pressure mounted, Hasina “could bank on India for full-fledged, no questions asked support,” The Indian Express newspaper reflected in a  recent  editorial.\n \n\n   \n  At home, however, her image became associated with an aggressive crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “She committed so much bloodshed to be in power,” the political scientist Hasan said.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s grip on power was seemingly unbreakable. She had proven adept at surviving storms of popular protest, arrests and assassination attempts, but the youth-led uprising that erupted last year was different.\n \n\n   \n  What began as student demonstrations over civil service job quotas quickly swelled into a nationwide roar for her resignation. The regime’s response was a brutal crackdown that, according to the UN human rights office, left as many as 1,400 people dead.\n \n\n   \n  But the bloodshed did not crush the movement – it galvanized it, turning public anger into an unstoppable force that ultimately toppled her government.\n \n\n   \n  “She had to flee,” Hasan said. “That act itself is an acknowledgement of guilt. The people, the forces, everyone turned against her because she pushed the boundaries. She killed, her order was to kill so many.”\n \n\n   \n    Sentenced to death\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s life as a political refugee in New Delhi brings her story full circle, returning her to the same state of exile she endured nearly half a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina was tried in absentia and sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court – a judicial body that she helped set up. There, Hasina faced charges primarily related to inciting the murder of protesters, ordering demonstrators be hanged, and ordering the use of lethal weapons, drones and helicopters to suppress the unrest.\n \n\n   \n  The court found it “crystal clear” that she had ordered the killing of student demonstrators. The death sentence was met with applause and tears in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  “It pacified us a bit,” Abdur Rab, the father of one victim, told Reuters. “But we will be fully content when we see the hangman’s rope around her neck.”\n \n\n   \n  India, which also has the death penalty, adopted a neutral stance, noting the verdict and vowing to “engage constructively with all stakeholders.”\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s family has praised New Delhi for giving her refuge. “India has always been a good friend,” Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, told local news agency ANI. “In the crisis, India has essentially saved my mother’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  For more than a decade, Hasina was one of India’s most steadfast regional allies. Her government was instrumental in cracking down on anti-India insurgent groups that used Bangladeshi territory as a safe haven.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had previously  lauded  Hasina for keeping their countries’ extensive border secure. Now her government’s downfall has raised significant security concerns in New Delhi that radical Islamist groups could re-emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Anil Trigunayat, an Indian diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said he “doubts very much” that New Delhi will send Hasina home to face prison or death.\n \n\n   \n  The former leader has rejected the allegations against her as a political witch hunt, allowing India to make a potential case that the charges against her were politically motivated.\n \n\n   \n  India’s extradition law, as well as its extradition treaty with Bangladesh, contains a “political offense” exception, designed for situations like this, allowing a state to refuse extradition if the crime is political in nature.\n \n\n   \n  “India will have to look at it (as a) political crime, not the crimes against humanity for which she has been charged there,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But Trigunayat noted that Hasina hasn’t exhausted all legal remedies. She can appeal the verdict in Bangladesh’s Supreme Court, then potentially the International Criminal Court in The Hague, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Since not all the remedies are exhausted, India would not be in a rush to send her,” Trigunayat said.\n \n\n   \n  The day Hasina was sentenced, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry called on India to hand her over “without delay.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is India’s responsibility in keeping with the existing bilateral extradition treaty between both countries,” the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s death sentence sets a tense stage for Bangladesh’s elections planned for next February.\n \n\n   \n  With her Awami League now banned and its leadership scattered, the interim government led by former Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus faces the monumental task of steering the nation out of its deeply polarized political culture.\n \n\n   \n  The Awami League’s absence leaves the political field open for its chief rival, Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and dozens of other smaller parties, to contest any future election, though experts warn the deep-seated divisions may not be easily resolved.\n \n\n   \n  “Bangladesh is far from reconciliation at this stage,” said the political scientist Hasan.\n \n\n   \n  He says the Awami League may attempt to stage a political comeback, albeit not under Hasina’s leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether Hasina’s demise marks the end of a toxic era, or simply the beginning of a new chapter of uncertainty.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/texas-supreme-court-congressional-redistricting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Pauses Lower Court Order That Blocked Texas’ New Congressional Maps","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has temporarily paused a federal lower court order that blocked Texas’ newly redrawn congressional maps, following an emergency appeal from the state.

A federal court had previously ruled that the maps likely violated the Equal Protection Clause by emphasizing racial compositions, citing a Justice Department letter from July urging changes to districts with non-White majorities.

Texas’ new congressional maps \n       \n  By John Fritze, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:54 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Texas urged the Supreme Court on Friday to boost President Donald Trump’s effort to help Republicans maintain control of Congress,   asking the justices to  review a federal court ruling  that found the state’s new map is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after the appeal was filed, Justice Samuel Alito temporarily blocked  the lower court ruling that barred Texas  from using the congressional maps, putting the fast-moving appeal on pause while the Supreme Court considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s emergency appeal could have enormous consequences for next year’s midterm elections, which will determine control of the House for the final two years of Trump’s presidency. A Democratic majority would likely unleash a string of investigations aimed at the administration and possibly block most of the president’s legislative agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Texas asked the Supreme Court to block the lower court ruling by December 1. It also urged the court to quickly step into the case on the merits now and expedite its review.\n \n\n   \n  The state said the lower court order had caused “chaos” in its elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Campaigning had already begun, candidates had already gathered signatures and filed applications to appear on the ballot under the 2025 map, and early voting for the March 3, 2026, primary was only 91 days away,” Texas officials told the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Alito asked the groups that challenged Texas’ maps to respond to the emergency appeal by Monday evening, suggesting he is eager to move the high-profile case at a fast pace. Alito, a conservative, handles appeals rising from courts within the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Alito will likely refer the case to the full court soon, and the “administrative” order he signed Friday night will remain in place only until all nine justices review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly called for red states to redraw districts and increase the number of GOP-held seats for political reasons. That has   set off an unusual mid-decade   arms race between red and blue states to redraw lines in order to maximize each party’s chances in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  At issue is whether Texas lawmakers violated the Constitution when they redrew the state’s congressional boundaries   based on a Trump Justice Department   letter urging the state to change the racial compositions of four of those districts. In a scathing opinion on Tuesday, a federal court found that focus on race when drawing the lines likely violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n \n\n   \n  The new Texas map would likely flip five Democratic-held House seats to Republican next year. House Republicans currently hold a narrow three-seat majority.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court has long been reticent to engage in these disputes. In 2019, the court extricated itself from litigation over partisan gerrymandering – ruling that those were political rather than legal matters. If Texas had justified its new map based on politics, the state would almost certainly have been able to defend the changes in federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  Texas told the Supreme Court in its emergency appeal Friday that politics, not race, drove the new maps.\n \n\n   \n  “This summer, the Texas Legislature did what legislatures do: politics,” the state told the high court.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement minutes after the state filed its appeal, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton reinforced the point.\n \n\n   \n  “Texas engaged in partisan redistricting solely to secure more Republican seats in Congress and thereby better represent our state and Texans,” Paxton said. “For years, Democrats have aggressively gerrymandered their states and only cry foul and hurl baseless ‘racism’ accusations because they are losing.”\n \n\n   \n  But the Supreme Court won’t have much, if any, room to maneuver around claims of racial gerrymander in the Texas case. The justices will have to decide on a relatively short fuse whether to temporarily block the lower court order that threw out the state’s new boundaries or leave that ruling in place.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional hopefuls in Texas must declare their candidacy by December 8. The state’s primaries are set for March.\n \n\n   \n  And those looming deadlines may prompt a majority of the court to decide that it’s too close to the election for federal courts to be wading into the Texas morass. Under a 2006 decision, the justices have warned federal courts to avoid making last-minute changes to the status quo of voting rules before an election. If the court decides that principle applies, then it would likely side with Texas – allowing the redrawn map to take effect for next year’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  Texas leaned heavily into that argument in its briefing Friday, asserting that it was too late – too close to the election – for federal courts to get involved.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, nominated to the bench by Trump during his first term, eviscerated the letter the Justice Department sent to Texas in July urging the redistricting.   That letter   warned of potential legal action over the state’s map because of what it called “unconstitutional” coalition districts, or districts with a non-White majority but where no single racial group makes up a majority.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s challenging to unpack the DOJ letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,” Brown wrote. “The gist of the letter, though, is that DOJ is urging Texas to change the racial compositions” of four districts.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, cited the DOJ letter when he added redistricting to the agenda of a special legislative session. By doing so, “the governor explicitly directed the legislature to draw a new US House map to resolve DOJ’s concerns,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “In other words, the governor explicitly directed the legislature to redistrict based on race,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  States may consider race when they redraw congressional lines – usually every decade following the census – but Supreme Court precedent bars race from being the predominant factor in that effort.\n \n\n   \n  “When given an opportunity to publicly proclaim that his motivation for adding redistricting to the legislative agenda was solely to improve Republicans’ electoral prospects at President Trump’s request, the governor denied any such motivation,” Brown wrote. “Instead, the governor expressly stated that his predominant motivation was racial.”\n \n\n   \n  The special three-judge court that heard the election case split 2-1, with an Obama appointee joining Brown and a nominee of President Ronald Reagan dissenting.\n \n\n   \n  The legal battles over efforts by Republicans and Democrats to enact rare, mid-decade congressional maps will continue to play out in coming weeks. Last week, the Justice Department sued officials in California over new maps meant to give Democrats in the Golden State an edge next year. A court is set to hear arguments in that case next month.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is considering a separate case dealing with congressional districts in Louisiana and the creation of a second Black-majority district there to comply with a federal court order. That case threatens to unwind how states, courts and civil rights groups have viewed the role of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to prevent racial discrimination in redistricting. It may also jeopardize majority-Black and heavily Democratic seats in several other states across the country.\n \n\n   \n  In the Texas case, Brown ordered the state to use the same map it drew after the 2020 census. Of the state’s 38 House seats, 25 are held by Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how quickly the court will decide the case. So far this year, in non-argued emergency cases, the court has taken an average of about three weeks to resolve appeals dealing with the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  US Circuit Judge Jerry Smith issued a sprawling dissent on Wednesday that repeatedly attacked Brown’s handling of the case. Smith argued that the majority opinion was “replete with legal and factual error, and accompanied by naked procedural abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  “If this were a law school exam, the opinion would deserve an ‘F,’” Smith wrote. “Judge Brown is an unskilled magician. The audience knows what is coming next.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/james-comey-wants-indictment-dismissed-lindsey-halligan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00-05:00","title":"James Comey asks for his indictment be dismissed over Lindsey Halligan’s grand jury revelation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Comey, the former FBI Director, is requesting that federal charges against him be dismissed, arguing that the final indictment was never approved by the grand jury.

Polantz, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:44 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey are asking a federal judge to dismiss the charges against him because, they say, a grand jury  never approved  the final indictment in the case.\n \n\n   \n  The  motion to dismiss  comes after prosecutors, including interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, said in court this week that the indictment — which omitted a count that the grand jury rejected — was not seen in its final form by all grand jurors.\n \n\n   \n  “The grand jury voted to reject the only indictment that the government presented to it,” Comey’s attorneys wrote in Friday’s filing. “Instead of presenting the grand jury with a revised indictment, Ms. Halligan signed a new two count indictment that the grand jury had never seen or voted on.”\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s team is asking the judge to toss the case by as soon as Monday because of the “flagrant nature of the government’s misconduct during the grand jury process.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because at least 12 jurors did not ‘approve the actual indictment,’ there is no valid indictment of Mr. Comey,” defense attorneys said in their filing Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The motion could set the stage for another dramatic week in the Comey case before courts break for Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  The new defense request compiles in one place nearly every grievance a magistrate judge and Comey’s team have compiled regarding the belief the Justice Department has acted inappropriately by charging Comey.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, the lead federal prosecutor in Comey’s criminal case said in court earlier this week that a full grand jury never reviewed the final indictment brought against him, but she reversed course in a brief filed Thursday saying there were  no mistakes  in how the indictment was handled in September.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan said part of the transcript from the September 25 hearing, when a magistrate judge in Alexandria, Virginia, was notified of the grand jury’s vote to approve charges against the ex-FBI director, “conclusively refutes” any suggestion that a problem exists with that part of the case.\n \n\n   \n  Of  prosecutors’ efforts to revise the prosecutors’ prior statements,  Comey’s attorneys wrote  their claims contradict “numerous other representations that the government has made to this Court.”\n \n\n   \n  Their arguments, defense attorneys added, “rests on an erroneous overreading of an ambiguous exchange between the grand jury foreperson and the magistrate judge.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate filing Friday, Comey’s team of attorneys also argued that a magistrate judge’s decision to turn over grand jury materials to the defense should remain in place despite prosecutors’ efforts to thwart it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge presiding over Comey’s case paused the magistrate judge’s decision to allow prosecutors to file an objection, which they did earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  In the original ruling, the magistrate judge found “the record points to a disturbing pattern of  profound investigative missteps ” in his ruling for prosecutors to hand over the grand jury material.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys say that the prosecutors’ arguments for why the material should not be released to them amounts to allowing the house to “burn down simply because they were not expecting the fire department to show up.”\n \n\n   \n  They added that the judge’s “order directing the government to disclose the grand jury materials was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.”\n \n\n   \n  “He found that ‘particularized and factually based grounds exist to support the proposition that irregularities in the grand jury proceedings may create abasis for dismissal of the indictment,’” Comey’s attorneys wrote, citing the magistrate judge’s opinion.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys have said there are several glaring issues with how Halligan — just days after she was appointed — presented the case to the grand jury, including by misstating Comey’s rights and through investigative missteps in the case.\n \n\n   \n   This story was

Most of the attempts were reported after  the Senate on Tuesday voted to adjourn  until January — rejecting Braun’s call for a special session focused on redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Enough is enough,” Braun said in a Friday afternoon  social media post . “These threats to lawmakers, including those received by me and my family in recent days, need to stop.”\n \n\n   \n  The alarming rise in threats against Indiana officials comes amid growing concerns about political violence, particularly after the September assassination of Charlie Kirk. Lawmakers and candidates in both parties have reported facing a sharp rise in threats and fears for their safety, with some – notably including US Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia – committing to lowering the tone of their rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  At least two congressional Democrats’ offices were targeted by bomb threats after they participated in a video urging US troops to disobey illegal orders.

Chris Deluzio’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement has not attributed the Indiana threats to a specific person or identified a cause. But the most recent reports come after Trump posted multiple times this week on his Truth Social platform about Indiana, where Republican senators have declined to convene for a special session to attempt to eliminate one or both of the state’s Democrat-held seats in the US House.\n \n\n   \n  “Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans, led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode, for not wanting to redistrict their State, allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats,” Trump posted Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “Senators Bray, Goode, and the others to be released to the public later this afternoon, should DO THEIR JOB, AND DO IT NOW!” he said. “If not, let’s get them out of office, ASAP.”\n \n\n   \n  Later Sunday, after Trump’s Truth Social post, Goode’s home was swatted, Goode and Vigo County Sheriff Derek Fell both said. Swatting is a false report made to authorities with the express purpose of luring them to a location — usually a home — where they are led to believe a horrific crime has been committed or is in progress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump posted again Monday that Bray, the Indiana Senate president pro tem, would face a primary challenge despite not being up for reelection until 2028, “as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Indiana Republicans denounce what they call ‘intimidation’ attempts\n \n\n   \n  In a rare bipartisan statement Friday, Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston and the top-ranking Democrat, state Rep. Phil GiaQuinta, said they are “praying for our colleagues, their families and neighbors, and our law enforcement partners.”\n \n\n   \n  “The threats, swatting attempts and other criminal activity being directed at our colleagues in the Senate are abhorrent and completely unacceptable. This is no way to express political disagreement, and it must stop,” the two House leaders said.\n \n\n   \n  Braun, the first-term Republican governor, said the Indiana State Police and other law enforcement “have been working around the clock all week to protect lawmakers and investigate threats.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the state police said they are working with both federal and local law enforcement officials to investigate.\n \n\n   \n  “Our goal is to seek criminal prosecution against those involved, to the fullest extent allowed by law,” the state police said in a statement. Their spokesperson, Capt. Ron Galaviz, when asked whether law enforcement believes the incidents are connected, directed CNN to that statement, which does not address the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on its role in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Andy Zay, a Republican from Huntington, said his rental car business was targeted Thursday with a bomb threat.\n \n\n   \n  And state Sen. Linda Rogers, a Republican from Granger, said in a statement she has been “the victim of several intimidation incidents,” and that local and state police are investigating. She said she would not provide additional details at the time.\n \n\n   \n  At least six more state senators said this week they’ve been the targets of swatting attempts. Several oppose redistricting, though neither Zay nor Rogers have taken a public position.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be clear: I strongly condemn these acts, which have no place in our political process,” Zay said in a statement. “While the intent behind these intimidation threats seems to be to instill fear in public officials, I can assure my constituents that I remain committed to serving our district, being your voice and continuing my work at the Statehouse.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/irs-ice-data-sharing-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:16:00Z","title":"Federal judge blocks IRS from sharing information to help ICE with deportations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, ruled that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) violated tax privacy laws by sharing home addresses of taxpayers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to assist in deportations.

sharing information to help ICE with deportations \n       \n  By Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:16 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Friday  blocked the IRS  from giving ICE the home addresses of taxpayers who might be undocumented immigrants — dealing a blow to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling is a significant victory for immigrant-rights group and liberal activists who are trying to resist the mass deportations that President Donald Trump has made a top priority for the first year of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration can appeal the decision, and it has a decent track record this year of overturning lower-court losses. A separate federal judge in a related case  previously declined  to block the data-sharing deal between Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Court records indicate that the IRS has provided ICE with information about 47,000 potentially undocumented taxpayers so far as part of the controversial data-sharing deal, a fraction of what the Trump administration requested. The Department of Homeland Security has said it wants this information to find people who came to the US illegally and have already been ordered by a judge to leave the country.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS rebuffed, and ultimately rejected, attempts to get information on  millions  of suspected undocumented immigrants with existing deportation orders. These disagreements created  months of tension  between IRS leadership and the White House, leading to the  resignation  and  ouster  of multiple IRS commissioners this year including Billy Long, a Trump loyalist.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the IRS and Treasury Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in her  94-page ruling  Friday that the data-sharing program was unlawful for several reasons, including because it violated legal requirements to keep sensitive taxpayer information private except for very strict exceptions, regardless of their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “Plaintiffs have shown that the IRS’s disclosure of confidential taxpayer address information to ICE was contrary to law because it did not comply with certain requirements in (the) Internal Revenue Code,” wrote Kollar-Kotelly, a Bill Clinton appointee.\n \n\n   \n  An order blocking the program was necessary because undocumented taxpayers were suffering irreparable harm, she  said.\n \n\n   \n  The judge rejected many of the Justice Department’s arguments for why the program was legal, concluding, among other things, that certain assertions were not credible. For instance, DOJ officials claimed that one single ICE agent was personally overseeing tens of thousands of investigations that might lead to criminal prosecutions and deportations.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court finds it unlikely that a single individual could be ‘personally and directly engaged’ in approximately 47,000 criminal matters, let alone 1.28 million of them, as ICE represented to the IRS,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote.\n \n\n   \n  This case was brought by the Center for Taxpayer Rights, a nonpartisan nonprofit that said the policy was hurting its clients at a low-income clinic, including undocumented immigrants. Millions of undocumented immigrants pay taxes each year — for decades, they have been encouraged to register with the IRS and pay what they owe, with assurances that their private information would stay confidential except for extremely rare cases.\n \n\n   \n  Other anti-Trump groups involved in the lawsuit praised the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an important win for millions of people in America whose information has been threatened by the Trump-Vance administration… the privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort,” Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00.000Z","title":"College athletes still banned from betting on professional sports after NCAA Division I schools vote to rescind proposed rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NCAA voted to rescind a proposed rule change that would have allowed college athletes to legally bet on professional sports, falling short of the required two-thirds majority by a narrow margin.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  College athletes will still be prohibited from betting on any sport in which the NCAA sponsors a championship after an eleventh-hour push to rescind a proposed rule change reached the necessary two-thirds threshold.\n \n\n   \n  Facing a 5 p.m. ET Friday deadline and needing 241 schools to submit paperwork preventing college athletes from betting on professional sports, the NCAA reached the necessary two-thirds majority, according to a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “After a procedural 30-day period, two-thirds of Division I member schools have voted to rescind a previously approved rule change that would have allowed student-athletes and athletics department staff members to legally participate in sports betting on professional sports only,” the  NCAA said . “Because sports betting rules are common legislation, the ban on all forms of betting — for sports in which the NCAA sponsors a championship — will remain in place for all three NCAA divisions.”\n \n\n   \n  A source told CNN Sports the NCAA hit 241 teams voting to rescind the rule at 4:30 p.m. ET, 30 minutes before the deadline.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA long had held firm prohibiting gambling on any sport in which it crowned a champion, aiming to prevent anything that could compromise the integrity of the game and stop harassment from bettors. The NCAA also argued that, because of its relationships and friendships with former athletes who turn pro, college players and staff could be privy to inside information that could compromise them.\n \n\n   \n  But citing the growth in legal sports betting nationwide – now permissible in 38 states – and arguing that sports betting was now available to regular college students, the NCAA agreed to change its policy. Toeing the line between endorsing gambling on sports and allowing it, the NCAA argued it was readily available to traditional students and therefore shouldn’t be forbidden for athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, the rule was meant to change on November 1, but when 75% of the cabinet members did not vote in favor, it triggered an automatic 30-day rescission window.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since, sports gambling has come under heightened scrutiny. In the last month,  federal authorities  have arrested two  Major League Baseball  players (Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz), as well as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones – all accused of taking part in separate gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  On the same day the decision was announced permitting wagering on professional sports, the NCAA announced that a former Temple basketball player and two staff members had bet on college and professional games and the player, Hysier Miller, included multiple parlays on his own team. The NCAA permanently banned Miller.\n \n\n   \n  He is now the 14th player from seven different schools to be caught in the crosshairs of gambling activities and banned.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA also recently permanently banned six college basketball players for game-fixing and just this week released a study that found 36% of Division I college basketball players have been subjected to harassment on social media from angry bettors..\n \n\n   \n  The NBA has asked its partner sportsbooks to consider prohibiting prop bets that it has identified as most susceptible to manipulation and NCAA president Charlie Baker has, since last year, asked sportsbooks to remove prop bets for college athletes.\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen states have banned prop bets on college athletes. Additionally, the national governing body recently partnered with Genius Sports, which will require sportsbooks to drop wagers on individual performances if they want access to real-time stats during the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments and other championship events.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/business/stock-market-dow","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:27:00-05:00","title":"What on Earth Just Happened to the Stock Market?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The stock market experienced dramatic volatility during the week, beginning with a sharp rally on Thursday that quickly reversed into a sell-off, followed by a partial recovery on Friday.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%.\n \n\n   \n  The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get  a December rate cut , after all.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December?\n \n\n   \n  At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting:\n \n\n   \n  Phew. Right?\n \n\n   \n  Wrong.\n \n\n   \n  Traders at first  cheered Thursday morning , sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday.\n \n\n   \n  Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions.\n \n\n   \n  “People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital.\n \n\n   \n  By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat.  Bitcoin  dropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022.\n \n\n   \n    So, what’s next?\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all.\n \n\n   \n  Investors also looked more closely at a  particularly confusing jobs report  and realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull.\n \n\n   \n  Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all.\n \n\n   \n  So here we are on Friday, right back where we started.  CNN’s Fear and Greed Index  is in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it?\n \n\n   \n  Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/florida-deputy-killed-eviction-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00.000Z","title":"Florida eviction turns deadly as a deputy is killed, shooter and two others wounded","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Florida sheriff’s deputy, Terri Mashkow, was killed during a routine eviction attempt in the Bermuda Club neighborhood near Vero Beach.

The locksmith is in surgery and listed in critical condition, as is the shooter, Flowers said. The other deputy was hit in the shoulder and is recovering, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The 47-year-old deputy who died, Terri Mashkow, was a 25-year-veteran of the sheriff’s office, Flowers said.

Flowers said the suspect had been posting “some negative items” about the Indian River Sheriff’s Office on a social media account.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past month, the sheriff’s office had received seven calls from the home, “almost all” of which were from the mother calling about her son, Flowers said. Still, deputies weren’t expecting any trouble when they arrived for the eviction Friday since “this was a standard call for service,” the sheriff said.\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately known whether Mashkow fired her weapon. “Our deputies did fire at him and he has been struck multiple times,” Flowers said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are still looking for more information on the suspect, Flowers said, but as of Friday there was nothing in his record to preclude him from legally having a firearm.\n \n\n   \n  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier acknowledged the shooting during an earlier news conference Friday, saying, “Just wanted to take a couple moments of silence for the officers that were in the line of duty.”\n \n\n   \n  Vero Beach is more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/media/trump-jimmy-kimmel-abc-carr-quiet-piggy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:30:00Z","title":"Kimmel Makes Trump an Offer After a Week of Attacks on ABC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump continues to launch aggressive attacks on late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel and ABC News, criticizing his ratings, tone, and coverage of sensitive topics like the Jeffrey Epstein files.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can  sign up for free here . \n \n\n   \n  “Every five weeks,” Jimmy Kimmel observed, President Trump “flips out and wants me fired.”\n \n\n   \n  It happened again this week, when the president posted on Truth Social, asking why ABC keeps “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on the air.\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel responded on Thursday night’s show, pointing out that Trump’s post came at 12:49 a.m., “11 minutes after the show ended on the East Coast.”\n \n\n   \n  He said directly to Trump, “Thanks for watching us on TV instead of on YouTube. We appreciate that. And I’ll tell you, it’s viewers like you who keep us on the air, ironically.”\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel, whose contract with ABC is coming due in May, then said, “Mr. President, I admire your tenacity. If you’re watching tonight, which I presume you are, how about this: I’ll go when you go, OK? We’ll be a team. Let’s ride off into the sunset together like Butch Cassidy and the Suntan Kid. And until then, if I may borrow a phrase from you: ‘Quiet, piggy.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s “piggy” remark to a Bloomberg reporter last week garnered widespread outrage this week, as did his insulting comments to ABC News correspondent Mary Bruce on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  One of Bruce’s questions about the government’s Jeffrey Epstein files prompted Trump to criticize her tone, bash ABC as a “crappy company,” and encourage the FCC to revoke the network’s licenses.\n \n\n   \n  Bruce was praised by fellow members of the White House press corps for asking important questions despite the president’s demeaning comments.\n \n\n   \n  After the tense Oval Office exchange, the White House generated a list of grievances against ABC and claimed the news division had decided to “wage war” against Trump and his voters.\n \n\n   \n  ABC and its parent company, Disney, declined to comment, choosing to let the news division’s work speak for itself.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday’s “Good Morning America,” co-host Robin Roberts referenced these “extremely challenging times” and thanked Bruce for “your willingness to ask these types of questions” to those in power.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s latest blast against Kimmel came Wednesday night, shortly after Kimmel talked on air about Trump reversing course and signing the bill compelling the Justice Department to release Epstein materials.\n \n\n   \n  “We are one step closer to answering the question, what did the president know and how old were these women when he knew it,” Kimmel quipped.\n \n\n   \n  Trump wrote that Kimmel has “NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS” and asked, “Why do the TV Syndicates put up with it? Also, totally biased coverage. Get the bum off the air!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Kimmel’s ratings are better than Trump thinks, but that’s beside the point. The point is that Trump wants to drive a wedge between Kimmel and local stations, which he called “syndicates.”\n \n\n   \n  Two big owners of ABC-affiliated stations, Nexstar and Sinclair, need Trump’s man in charge of regulating stations, FCC chair Brendan Carr, to approve pending deals.\n \n\n   \n  Both Nexstar and Sinclair yanked Kimmel’s show back in September when Carr denounced Kimmel’s remarks about Charlie Kirk’s suspected killer. The highly unusual blackout spotlighted longstanding tensions between local affiliates and national networks — as well as the affiliates’ limited power.\n \n\n   \n  ABC briefly suspended Kimmel’s show nationwide, but brought it back in a matter of days, leaving Nexstar and Sinclair  little choice  but to resume airing it.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week Carr announced that the FCC will review the relationships between networks and affiliates, though his agency has little power to effect change.\n \n\n   \n  As for Kimmel, he made it sound like he’s grown accustomed to Trump’s angry posts.\n \n\n   \n  “I woke up this morning, I’m in bed, my wife comes out of the bathroom, she’s got her phone,” Kimmel said. “She goes, ‘Um, Trump tweeted you should be fired again.’ I was like, ‘Oh.’ And then I went downstairs and made bagels for the kids.”\n \n\n   \n  He also remarked that “if you got this many threats from a neighbor, you’d have no problem getting a restraining order. The judge would be like, ‘Yeah, sounds like the guy’s nuts.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also recently took out his anger on another late-night comic, NBC’s Seth Meyers; last Saturday Trump said Meyers has “an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome” and “NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!”\n \n\n   \n  Carr reposted Trump’s message on X without any further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meyers brought up Trump’s grievance on Monday’s edition of “Late Night,” remarking that “being attacked by the president this weekend doesn’t make me special in any way, shape or form. I was simply on the same shit list as Christopher Wray, James Comey, Indiana Republicans, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former President Joe Biden.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/entertainment/dolly-parton-skips-events-health-challenges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:42:00-05:00","title":"Dolly Parton skips events as she further deals with 'health challenges'","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dolly Parton, the legendary singer and entrepreneur, has missed two major public events — the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions Hall of Fame induction and the Academy Governors Awards — due to ongoing health challenges.

injured after attack at West Bank junction \n       \n  By Dana Karni and Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:36 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least one Israeli was killed and three injured in a ramming and stabbing attack at a junction in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, according to Israeli emergency services.\n \n\n   \n  The group was attacked in a vehicle ramming and stabbing incident at Gush Etzion Junction, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n \n\n   \n  One man was killed at the scene as a result of a “severe stab wound,” according to Elad Pas, a paramedic with Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s emergency response service. One woman was in serious condition after the attack, Pas said, while two more were in moderate condition.\n \n\n   \n  Two “terrorists” were “eliminated” by IDF soldiers at the scene of the attack, the military said.\n \n\n   \n  “Several explosive materials were found in the vehicle used by the terrorists, and are currently being neutralized by Israel Border Police bomb disposal specialists,” the IDF wrote in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid called the attack “severe,” saying that it took “the life of a young Israeli citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  “I offer my support to the IDF and the security forces in their efforts to restore security and eradicate terrorism. I send warm condolences to the family of the murdered victim and wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured,” Lapid said.\n \n\n   \n  Stabbing and ramming attacks by Palestinian militants in Israel, Jerusalem and the West Bank are not uncommon, taking place at checkpoints, transit hubs and other busy public areas with some regularity.\n \n\n   \n  Violence in the West Bank has also surged recently. A United Nations report released earlier this month found that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the largest number since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians and activists have been assaulted or detained as they attempted to peacefully harvest olives. Last week, a mosque in the West Bank was torched and sprayed with graffiti. On Monday, dozens of Israeli settlers set Palestinian vehicles and homes on fire in a village in the West Bank, after Israeli forces tore down settlers’ illegal outpost structures in the area.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad praised Tuesday’s attack, saying that it was “in response to the ongoing crimes committed by settler gangs and the occupation army against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The militant group did not claim responsibility for the attack, but said that it affirmed “our people’s determination to confront policies of oppression and abuse by all available means.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas also praised the attack, though did not claim responsibility for it, calling it “an inevitable outcome” of Israel’s “persistence in its aggression against our people, our land, and our holy sites.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/house-oversight-committee-epstein-files-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:45:00.000Z","title":"House Oversight Committee Widens Investigation into Jeffrey Epstein","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Oversight Committee is expanding its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, issuing subpoenas to JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, and the US Virgin Islands attorney general, and seeking to interview survivors and key figures like Ghislaine Maxwell and Harvard’s former president Larry Summers.

James Comer issued subpoenas to two banks, called for a slew of documents from the US Virgin Islands attorney general and solicited advice from Epstein survivors about what the committee should next target. The panel has so far  released  tens of thousands of documents, emails and communications that it received from the Epstein estate that continue to open new lines of investigative inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the committee threatened contempt of Congress if Bill and Hillary Clinton did not comply with their subpoenas and quickly schedule their depositions. CNN has reached out to the Clintons for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also still want to interview  Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s accomplice. Her attorneys recently told the panel that Maxwell would assert her 5th Amendment rights and would refuse to answer questions, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough review of the federal government’s investigation of Jeffrey Epstein in order to bring transparency for the American people and accountability for survivors,” Comer said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The panel also has its own subpoena to DOJ for all 300 gigabytes of the Epstein files. Sources familiar with the investigation say it is different than  the law recently signed  by President Donald Trump in that the committee’s subpoena does not have any exceptions to it, while the law allows for DOJ to decide if any documents pertaining to an ongoing investigation can be withheld.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources familiar with the investigation said that investigators are looking to expand the subpoenas to banks to over a dozen and are actively expanding the investigation’s witness list, including survivors who want to share their stories, individuals involved in Epstein’s 2008 so-called sweetheart deal, and former Palm Beach officials related to a separate investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “The committee is in a constant state of interviews and talking to people. We’re having conversations regularly with survivors, we’re taking information from them. We’re talking regularly to folks that were in Epstein’s network that knew him,” one of the sources told CNN. “We have an active whistleblower line and people send information to us.”\n \n\n   \n  In a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, congressional staff asked survivors and their attorneys where the committee should look next in its ongoing probe of Epstein. One individual responded that the panel should subpoena Harvard, remarking that the elite school used to be a quintessential “old boys’ club.”\n \n\n   \n  Staff in the room responded positively to the suggestion and affirmed that the panel was in fact willing to look into investigating the university, sources said, though issuing a subpoena is not typically the first step.\n \n\n   \n  The exchange comes as Harvard University is once again embroiled in an Epstein scandal after the Oversight panel released last week tens of thousands of documents that it received from the Epstein estate.\n \n\n   \n  The trove of documents released last week  showed that Larry Summers , Harvard’s former president and one of its most prominent faculty, had a years-long, intimate correspondence and friendship with Epstein. In emails between the years 2013 and 2019, the two men frequently bantered about current events and high-profile figures in elite orbits; at other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers’ romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice.\n \n\n   \n  Summers has since resigned from numerous public roles, including board member of OpenAI and Santander and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. In an initial statement, Summers said he was “deeply ashamed” about his relationship with Epstein but that he would continue his teaching commitments. Later in the same week, Harvard said Summers would not be finishing the semester as an instructor at the university.\n \n\n   \n  Harvard, which has long had deep ties to Epstein, announced this week that it is launching an investigation not only into Summers’ connection with the pedophile, but also any other university affiliates implicated in last week’s documents release, The Harvard Crimson  first reported .\n \n\n   \n    More subpoenas and interviews to come\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department has 30 days to comply with the Epstein files law Trump signed Wednesday, but how exactly the agency will release the files and any potential restrictions are far from clear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has separately instructed the Department of Justice to further investigate Epstein’s relationship with a number of high-profile individuals, including Summers.\n \n\n   \n  On the same day that the House voted to release all of the Epstein files, the Oversight panel subpoenaed JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank for Epstein’s financial records as Republicans believe Epstein’s finances provide a whole new wealth of information.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we have just scratched the surface on Epstein,” GOP Rep. Tim Burchett, who serves on the House Oversight Committee, told CNN. “I think we are going to have to dig very deep into his finances and we may never know the full extent to his network.”\n \n\n   \n  Specifically, the Republican-led panel is demanding documents pertaining to a 2019  JPMorgan Chase  internal investigation into Epstein, known as “Project Jeep” that retroactively flagged 4,700 Epstein transactions as suspicious. Epstein held accounts with JPMorgan Chase for approximately two decades until 2013 when the bank reportedly closed all of Epstein’s accounts and he banked with Deutsche Bank from 2013 through potentially late 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “In short, the records sought by this subpoena are critical to further the Committee’s investigation,” Comer wrote in his subpoena letters on November 18.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden  released  a report this week claiming that recently unsealed court records show that JPMorgan Chase “underreported Epstein’s suspicious transactions to the federal government for nearly two decades.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to Wyden’s report, JPMorgan’s Patricia Wexler said in a statement to CNN, “We acted appropriately in filing SARs as early as 2002. The second the government finally made public the sex trafficking details in 2019 — information they clearly had for years — we identified for law enforcement a range of Epstein’s past transactions intended to assist with the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  The Oversight committee also requested a tranche of documents from US Virgin Islands Attorney General Gordon Rhea to further dig into Epstein’s life on his two private islands where he allegedly leveraged his personal and business relationships to negotiate lucrative tax breaks and even pay off local law enforcement, according to the panel’s letter. The committee wants to learn more about USVI’s 2020 law enforcement action against Epstein and the subsequent settlements to the tune of millions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  “The Committee believes that the documents related to Mr. Epstein, his estate, and the USVI litigation will aide its ongoing investigation into Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and the federal government’s investigation into both individuals,” Comer’s subpoena letter states.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Rhea for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Given Epstein’s communication with USVI Governor Kenneth E. Mapp and text messages during a 2019 congressional hearing with Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands in Congress as a non-voting delegate, the committee argued in its letter to Rhea that there is an “interconnectedness between the USVI and Mr. Epstein.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/brian-walshe-guilty-plea-legal-defense","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00-21:00","title":"Brian Walshe pleads guilty to disposing of wife’s body; how it affects murder trial","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, a Massachusetts man, has pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper disposal of his wife Ana Walshe’s body, without admitting to her murder.

Here’s what that could mean for his murder trial \n       \n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:51 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man on trial for murdering his wife in 2023 has admitted he disposed of her body in dumpsters and misled police, but his lawyers insist he is not admitting to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with the court having chosen the jury that will consider the murder charge still haunting him, the question becomes: How will  Brian Walshe’s  legal team defend him?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, minutes before jury selection was set to begin for his murder trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife, Ana Walshe. The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection was completed on Thursday.  CNN affiliate WCVB  reported 16 panelists had been chosen, 12 of whom will decide the case. The other four will be alternates.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The court has previously indicated that opening statements are slated to begin on December 1.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/robert-brooks-death-ny-sentencing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:36:00Z","title":"4 guards sentenced in brutal beating death of an incarcerated Black man at New York prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Four prison guards were sentenced in connection with the fatal beating of Robert Brooks, a Black man serving a 12-year sentence for assault, who was restrained and violently attacked at Marcy Correctional Facility in upstate New York.

prison guards involved  in the death of an incarcerated Black man  whose brutal beating at an upstate New York prison last year was captured on body-worn camera videos were each sentenced Friday to prison terms.\n \n\n   \n  The four had  pleaded   guilty  in September, just two weeks before the start of the trial for a group of guards accused in the death of Robert Brooks, who was pummeled while handcuffed at the Marcy Correctional Facility on Dec. 9. The beating of the restrained 43-year-old man triggered outrage and calls for reform.\n \n\n   \n  Nicholas Anzalone and Anthony Farina, who both had faced a top charge of murder before pleading guilty to a lesser charge of first-degree manslaughter, each received 22-year terms. Two more men charged with second-degree manslaughter also pleaded guilty. Michael Mashaw was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, while David Walters got two years, four months to seven years.\n \n\n   \n  Brooks had been serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault since 2017 and was transferred to Marcy from a nearby lockup on the night he was beaten. The videos show Brooks being struck in the chest with a shoe, lifted by his neck and then dropped.\n \n\n   \n  During the hearing, prosecutors read statements from Brooks’ relatives, including his brother, Jared Ricks, who wrote that he hopes the “welcoming committee” shows the four defendants more grace when they arrive in state prison as incarcerated people than they showed his brother,  Syracuse.com reported .\n \n\n   \n  The victim’s son, Robert Brooks Jr., wrote that watching the video of his father’s fatal beating was like watching a horror movie.\n \n\n   \n  “I pray this case teaches others that they can’t treat incarcerated people like animals,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, the special prosecutor in the case, said the two men were not allowed to read their statements themselves due to objections from all four defense attorneys after Fitzpatrick failed to file the required paperwork.\n \n\n   \n  The first plea in the case came last May, when a guard charged with murder pleaded guilty to manslaughter under a deal with prosecutors. Christopher Walrath, who resigned, was sentenced in August to 15 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Another  guard pleaded guilty later in May  to attempted tampering with physical evidence and was sentenced to a one-year conditional discharge.\n \n\n   \n  The trial of three other guards charged with murder and first-degree manslaughter concluded last month with a jury convicting David Kingsley on both counts but acquitting the other two, Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer. Kingsley faces a potential life term when he’s sentenced, while the last guard, Michael Fisher, is scheduled to stand trial in January on a second-degree manslaughter charge.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick is also prosecuting guards in  the March 1 fatal beating of Messiah Nantwi  at another Marcy lockup, the Mid-State Correctional Facility. Eight guards have reached plea deals in the case, while five others are scheduled to stand trial in March, including two who are charged with murder.\n \n\n   \n  Both prisons are about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of New York City.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/state-department-freedom-speech-human-rights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:08:00Z","title":"State Department to identify DEI policies and mass migration as ‘human rights infringements’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. State Department is revising its annual human rights report to align with the Trump administration's political agenda, requiring diplomats to classify DEI policies, mass migration, and abortion funding as human rights infringements.

policies and mass migration as ‘human rights infringements’ \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:08 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US State Department will require its diplomats describe enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, alleged facilitation of mass migration, and government funding that supports abortion medications as “human rights infringements” in its next human rights report, a senior State Department official said Thursday, as the Trump administration moves to further align the report with its domestic politics.\n \n\n   \n  The report will also shift focus to “natural rights” like freedom of speech, the official said, in a move likely to target traditional European allies for alleged freedom of speech restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department instructed all embassies and consulates in a diplomatic cable Thursday to begin preparing the congressionally required annual report, which is meant to describe human rights abuses in countries around the world. The official said they are encouraging diplomats to “go out in the field, talk to people, collect data that then informs the report.”\n \n\n   \n  The new requirements further institutionalize changes seen in the  latest report released in August , which covered the 2024 calendar year. They also align with the administration’s domestic priorities.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday the State Department called migration “an existential threat to Western civilization” and said it instructed its diplomats “to report on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration.”\n \n\n   \n  Top administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have  lambasted European nations  over allegations of free speech backsliding while also meeting with far-right European political figures. At the same time, the administration has also revoked and denied visas for alleged antisemitic speech and comments made about the murder of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\n \n\n   \n  The senior State Department official said Thursday that they “are moving away from group identities, group labels, and focusing on the fact that when a person is persecuted for whatever reason, that is a violation of the moral law.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re making sure that we’re promoting individual freedom not based on some group identity,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The official described a catalogue of “infringements on human rights” that diplomats preparing the report will be required to note.\n \n\n   \n  These include “arrests, administrative penalties, and ‘official investigations or warnings’ for speech; the enforcement of policies like affirmative action of diversity, equity, and inclusion that ‘provide preferential treatment’ to workers on the basis of race, sex, or caste; the facilitation of mass or illegal migration across a country’s territory into other countries;” gender affirming care for minors; and “state subsidization of abortions or abortifacient drugs.” They will also be required to note “the total estimated number of annual abortions.”\n \n\n   \n  “In recent years, new destructive ideologies have given safe harbor to human rights violations. The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked,” State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A former senior State Department official who worked on human rights decried the changes, arguing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio “is abandoning decades of bipartisan U.S leadership on universal human rights, and replacing it with a dangerous theocratic ideology that has more in common with The Handmaid’s Tale than with the Declaration of Independence.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is yet another example of the Trump Administration sacrificing the rights and principles that generations of Americans have fought and died for, and that generations of people around the world looked to for moral inspiration,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The latest report, which was released in August, was  drastically pared down  from past years. It alleged “significant human rights issues” in allied countries including the United Kingdom, France and Germany over “serious restrictions on freedom of expression.”\n \n\n   \n  That report had been stripped of specific sections of reporting on alleged abuses based on sexual orientation, violence toward women and systemic racial or ethnic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The future report is “really going to reflect what’s going on in the country,” the senior State Department official said.\n \n\n   \n  “For instance, in Western Europe, we see a backsliding of the protection of freedom of expression. So of course, we’re going to prioritize that versus another country that is maybe not curtailing free speech as much,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to Western Europe, we’re not saying that we’re favoring one opposition party or one particular political group. We’re saying all groups, all parties, all people should be able to speak freely, and that includes on the internet. That includes on social media,” the senior State Department official said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “In Europe, the (Digital Services Act) is a regulatory regime that restricts speech online,” the official said, referencing a sweeping EU law that requires Big Tech platforms to take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.\n \n\n   \n  The official noted that the human rights report, formally known as the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, is used “as a tool to change the behavior of governments.”\n \n\n   \n  “When our European friends are restricting free speech, we’ll have a conversation, and if they make changes, we will note that in the future report,” they said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/zohran-mamdani-polling-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:20:00-05:00","title":"What Americans Think of Zohran Mamdani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes public opinion on Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City and a self-described democratic socialist, showing that while he is not widely unpopular, he strongly polarizes Republicans — especially older voters — who view him negatively. In contrast, independents and Democrats show more balanced or even favorable views. Polling data from Marquette University Law School and Reuters-Ipsos indicate that Mamdani’s negative ratings are not extreme compared to other top politicians.

And is Mamdani proving to be the boogeyman Republicans hope he’ll be?\n \n\n   \n  We’ve got some new national polling conducted after the self-described democratic socialist’s win earlier this month. And it offers some clues.\n \n\n   \n  In sum: Mamdani isn’t particularly unpopular, especially relative to plenty of other big-name US politicians. But he does clearly animate Republicans and older Americans against him — a lot more than he animates Democrats and young people for him.\n \n\n   \n  And that reinforces the potential utility for the GOP of making him a main character nationally.\n \n\n   \n  A  Marquette University Law School poll  this week showed Americans viewed Mamdani unfavorably by a 38%-29% margin, while a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  released last week showed they disliked him 36%-33%.\n \n\n   \n  These are negative numbers, but they’re not exactly “pariah” numbers. In fact, these surveys show Mamdani’s splits are better than some of the most well-known American politicians.\n \n\n   \n  Those include Trump (17-19 points underwater), Vice President JD Vance (14-16 points underwater) and Kamala Harris (minus-19 in the Marquette poll).\n \n\n   \n  Even when it comes to the political middle, the democratic socialist appears to be in relatively decent territory — at least at this early juncture. (He doesn’t take office until January 1.)\n \n\n   \n  While independents disliked him 35%-25% in the Marquette poll, those numbers were actually significantly better than Trump’s (70%-29% unfavorable), Vance’s (60-25%), Harris’s (55%-38%) and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s (54%-32%).\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most strikingly, the Reuters poll actually showed Mamdani’s favorable rating among independents (30%) was actually slightly higher than Trump’s (26%) and similar to Vance’s (28%) — even though Mamdani is far less well-known. (33% of independents viewed him negatively.)\n \n\n   \n  The numbers seem to reinforce something we’ve seen with other prominent democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And that’s that Americans don’t write them off just because of the s-word. (In fact, a July Gallup poll showed Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were actually the  two most popular US politicians among 10 figures  tested.)\n \n\n   \n  Americans seem open to democratic socialists, as long as they are appealing on a personal level and focus on what they think are the right things.\n \n\n   \n  And for Mamdani, that’s  all about affordability . Even the White House has given Mamdani props for that, suggesting it helped him overcome efforts to label him an extremist.\n \n\n   \n  “Why did Zohran Mamdani do so well last night? He relentlessly focused on affordability,” White House political adviser James Blair  told Politico  the day after the election. “People talk about communists, they can say all these things, but the fact is he was talking about the cost of living.”\n \n\n   \n  And there seems to be something to that. In fact, polls have suggested Americans are actually  in favor of some of Mamdani’s more socialistic ideas , including rent freezing, free public buses and even the much-maligned (on the right) government-owned grocery stores.\n \n\n   \n  You could be forgiven for thinking people just want to see politicians  doing something  about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump’s lack of focus on those issues seems to be costing him dearly, with the Marquette poll showing Americans disapproved of him on the “cost of living” by a massive 72%-28% margin. Even 4 in 10 Republicans disapproved of him on that issue.\n \n\n   \n  All of this being said, it’s clear Mamdani can be politically useful for Republicans. That’s because he negatively polarizes some key groups.\n \n\n   \n  In both polls, strong views of Mamdani tilted more negative — by about a 2-to-1 margin in. That suggests the passion was very much on the “anti” side — and that he mobilizes the opposition.\n \n\n   \n  In the Marquette poll, for instance, 56% of Republicans viewed Mamdani “very unfavorably,” compared to just 30% of Democrats who viewed him “very favorably.”\n \n\n   \n  About three-quarters of Republicans who knew Mamdani well enough to rate him felt very negatively toward him. But less than half of Democrats who knew Mamdani that well rated him very positively.\n \n\n   \n  This negative polarization is also particularly strong among older voters. Four times as many Americans aged 60 or older viewed Mamdani very negatively as very positively, according to the Marquette poll. It was about a 3-to-1 margin among Americans aged 45 through 59.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, you could certainly understand why Republicans want to elevate Mamdani. But using him as a foil doesn’t seem like a silver bullet right now, especially as he seems to have tapped into an issue Trump has struggled with.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/john-bolton-trial-classified-documents","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-05:00","title":"More charges are possible against John Bolton, Justice Department says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, may face additional criminal charges over allegations of illegally sharing classified national defense information during Trump’s first term.

national security adviser  John Bolton  could face more charges, Justice Department prosecutors suggested at a Friday court hearing in his criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department continues to go through the large amount of documents recovered in the case, including from Bolton’s home in Maryland and his office in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  The material, which prosecutors say includes classified information they accuse Bolton of illegally sharing with others during his time in Trump’s first term, must be reviewed by the intelligence community before Bolton’s defense team can have access to it.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, declined to comment on prosecutor’s suggestion that additional charges could come.\n \n\n   \n  Because of this extended process for discovery, no trial has been set in the case and the review alone is expected to last until at least May.\n \n\n   \n  Coming into the hearing, prosecutors and Bolton’s team proposed that all discovery would be produced by late May, but US District Judge Theodore Chuang on Friday appeared frustrated with that plan and ordered prosecutors to speed up production of the documents at the center of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m still having trouble with why we need seven months for this,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Chuang, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, at one point scolded

issues they say have been slowing down their work, including the involvement of a “filter team” to help figure out which material may involve attorney-client privilege.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas Sullivan, the lead prosecutor in the case, told the judge that there was a “voluminous” amount of documents in the case that needed to be sifted through by both his team, the intelligence community and that separate “filter team.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a process that takes time,” Sullivan said. “I can assure the court that we are working with them to review these documents as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n

Erick Moynihan, the officer who with Grubb had ordered Young out of her car.\n \n\n   \n  They never heard from Grubb, whose side of the story was contained in a written statement read into the record by a special agent for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. He attended the trial, but prosecutors were unable to question him directly.\n \n\n   \n  Grubb and Moynihan had approached Young’s parked car on Aug. 24, 2023, about a report that she was suspected of stealing alcohol from a Kroger store in the Columbus suburb. She partially lowered her window and protested as both officers cursed at her and yelled at her to get out.

Make these 3 things habits \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:03 PM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The holiday season can be intense. People are traveling, hosting family and friends, and going to events — all the while keeping up other responsibilities of work and caregiving.\n \n\n   \n  All this activity has me thinking about the importance of keeping our immune systems healthy. What are some habits that everyone should adopt, such as getting good sleep, eating well and exercising regularly? Conversely, are there some habits people should consider stopping because of their negative impacts on the immune system?\n \n\n   \n  What about vaccines — is it too late to get vaccinated against respiratory viruses if you are going to family gatherings with newborns or older adults? And are there other safety tips people should keep in mind to reduce their chances of getting sick during the holidays?\n \n\n   \n  To help sort through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   Why it is especially important to keep our immune system healthy? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Our immune systems are our body’s natural defense against viruses, bacteria and other potential pathogens. Strong, healthy immune systems reduce the risk of contracting infectious diseases and falling seriously ill from them. The immune system is also implicated in some chronic diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Immunity is influenced by many factors, some of which are within our control. Getting recommended vaccines, for example, helps to build immunity against certain diseases. Beyond vaccines, there are several lifestyle factors that research shows also boost our body’s immune function.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What habits should people adopt if they want to boost their immune function? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  There are three important habits that people should consider. First, keep physically active. In addition to reducing your chance of developing chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease, exercise stimulates the immune system. Being physically active may lower your chance of dying from the flu or pneumonia, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n \n\n   \n  Second, cut down on ultraprocessed foods. These “junk foods” contain high amounts of chemicals like preservatives, emulsifiers, artificial colorings and dyes. Eating higher amounts of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespan  by more than 10% . These foods have also been linked with  inflammation and dysregulation .\n \n\n   \n  Lack of physical activity and higher consumption of ultraprocessed food are both associated with obesity, which is  linked  to impaired immune function. People should aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate to high-intensity exercise and should try to have a diet that emphasizes  whole foods  such as vegetables, lean meats, beans, whole grains and nuts.\n \n\n   \n  Third, aim for better sleep. Studies have shown that  sleep deprivation  induces immune changes that increase the risk of various diseases. And people who routinely get  fewer than seven hours  of sleep a night have a higher likelihood of developing high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.\n \n\n   \n  There are several methods that can help with improved sleep. Many people struggle because they simply don’t have enough time in bed.  Try to prioritize  at least eight hours in bed and aim to go to bed and to rise around the same time every day. Other elements of good sleep hygiene include not using screens before sleep and optimizing your sleep environment with a cool, quiet and dark place.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there habits that people should consider stopping to improve their immune systems?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes. The most important are to avoid smoking and excessive alcohol.\n \n\n   \n   Many studies  have linked smoking to both short- and  long-term  effects on immunity, including impairing the body’s ability to fight viral and bacterial infections. Some of these effects are reversed by smoking cessation.  Excessive alcohol intake  can also weaken immune system response.\n \n\n   \n  Individuals who wish to quit smoking can speak with a physician about options. There are medications that can help in addition to nicotine replacement therapies.\n \n\n   \n  The holidays may be a tough time to cut back on alcohol consumption, but people should try to  avoid binge drinking  and to keep within  guidelines of drinking in moderation  (two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women on days when alcohol is consumed).\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Is it too late to get vaccinated against respiratory viruses if you are going to family gatherings with newborns or older adults?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  It can take a couple of weeks for the body to build up antibody responses after vaccination. In general, it’s definitely a good idea to be sure you are up to date with your recommended vaccines and to be sure to get your annual flu and Covid-19 vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  If you are getting together in, say, a few days from now with vulnerable loved ones, obtaining the shots now probably won’t change your protection during this visit, but it’s still a good idea to get them since it will certainly help you throughout the respiratory virus season.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What should vulnerable people do to reduce their risk of getting sick during the holidays? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  They should try to avoid crowded settings with many people shouting and speaking loudly. They should consider masking with an N95 or equivalent mask while traveling and in crowded public places.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there other virus safety tips people can use to reduce their chance of getting sick during the holidays? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Don’t forget to wash your hands often and well with soap and water. If you are hosting an event, consider asking those who have signs of respiratory infection like fever and cough to stay home.\n \n\n   \n  And please enjoy the holidays! Loneliness and feeling isolated can actually  impair  the immune system. The holidays  may be tiring and stressful , but being together with those you love —  whether it’s family or your family of friends  — can bring many benefits to your emotional and physical health.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/uk/former-reform-uk-leader-jailed-for-accepting-pro-russian-bribes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:02:00-05:00","title":"Former key figure in UK populist party Reform jailed for taking bribes to make pro-Russia statements","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nathan Gill, a former leader of Reform UK Wales and former member of the European Parliament, has been jailed for ten and a half years after admitting to accepting tens of thousands of pounds in cash from pro-Russian Ukrainian figures, including Oleg Voloshyn, in exchange for making pro-Russian statements in the European Parliament and to pro-Russian media outlets.

prepare for potential cabinet shakeup after one-year mark \n       \n  By Priscilla Alvarez, Kristen Holmes, Jeff Zeleny, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:30 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The White House is preparing for possible turnover in the Cabinet after President Donald Trump reaches the one-year mark of his term, potentially shaking up his otherwise stable team of secretaries, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s cadre of secretaries, administrators and directors that form the official Cabinet has so far been relatively steady — by design, as officials close to the president aimed to avoid the imagery of Trump’s  turnover-filled  first term in office. But that could change as he completes his first year back in office in January.\n \n\n   \n  At least one of the federal agencies that could see change is the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency helmed by Kristi Noem that is charged with executing Trump’s campaign  promise of mass deportation . Sources also said there could be turnover in the Department of Energy, currently run by  Chris Wright , a former Colorado fracking executive whose relationship with the White House has frayed in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  While there are ongoing discussions, officials stressed that no decisions have been made, and the Cabinet is expected to remain the same at least through the start of next year.\n \n\n   \n  “The cabinet is not changing no matter how much CNN wishes that it would because it thrives off drama,” said White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.\n \n\n   \n    Friction at Homeland Security\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself is happy with Noem, multiple sources told CNN, and he has consistently praised her in public and private settings. But behind the scenes, some top White House officials have become frustrated with chief adviser Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Noem confidante who was tapped early on to serve at DHS as a special government employee — a temporary status.\n \n\n   \n  “The President loves Kristi. He loves the job she’s doing,” one senior White House official told CNN, pushing back on the notion that the former South Dakota governor was on the chopping block.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s history with Noem, dating back to when she was governor, and their dual leadership of the department has prompted questions about whether the two would leave together, therefore opening the head position at DHS.\n \n\n   \n  A familiar face in Trump’s orbit who helped run his 2016 campaign, Lewandowski has become ensconced at DHS and is often at Noem’s side. The enormous power he’s amassed has also put him in the crosshairs of some senior White House officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, he likes [Noem], but it has been brought to his attention that [Lewandowski] is a problem, and the agency is being mismanaged because of it,” a person close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  At DHS, Lewandowski has  directed the firings of personnel , requested employees be put on administrative leave, called agency leaders “to hold them accountable,” and been described as a micro-manager — including for the massive infusion of cash the department has received to ramp up deportations. Multiple sources told CNN Lewandowski has developed a reputation at the department of reprimanding officials who he views as slowing down the administration’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  “The tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security – a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens – at President Trump’s direction and under Secretary Noem’s leadership, speak for themselves,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  And a DHS spokesperson said in response to CNN’s questions: “Mr. Lewandowski certainly has reputation of reprimanding officials who impede or slow down the administration and undermine the will of the American people—the American people voted for Donald J. Trump, not a bureaucrat.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, Trump convened a meeting with Lewandowski and Noem over the management of DHS, according to two people familiar with the event. One person said the Oval Office sit-down grew contentious, particularly between Lewandowski and Trump, who left the meeting irritated with Lewandowski. The tense meeting was notable to some inside the White House who believe that Lewandowski has only survived because of his strong relationship with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s relationship with many in Trump’s inner circle, including Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, is strained after the 2024 campaign, according to multiple people in and around the White House. Lewandowski was brought on to work for then-campaign co-chairs Wiles and Chris LaCivita just months before Election Day, with the candidate telling his former campaign manager he missed the old days of his first run for the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic quickly devolved into a power struggle, with Wiles and LaCivita irked by Lewandowski’s efforts to constantly assert himself in high-level decisions, often taking his opinions directly to Trump, people familiar with the discussions told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski  was sidelined  before the campaign ended, and he didn’t score a top position in the West Wing. Instead, he ended up at Homeland Security with a  temporary job status  that is supposed to last for only 130 workdays in a yearlong period. Though Lewandowski began working for DHS soon after Trump returned to office, the spokesperson said he still had 40 days remaining.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the current relationship, a White House official noted that Wiles had a meeting with Noem and Lewandowski regarding FEMA this week.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, DHS often caught the ire of the president over not doing enough to clamp down on immigration. Over the course of that term, the department had five secretaries, three of whom served in acting capacities.\n \n\n   \n    Other Cabinet questions\n \n\n   \n  Wright has also found himself on the outs with the White House recently, people familiar with the dynamics told CNN, prompting speculation his job atop the Energy Department might be in a precarious position. The people familiar said that some White House officials have privately complained that Wright was slow-walking some initiatives that Trump promised during his campaign and that he has contributed to high turnover in some of the agency’s top jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Wright has been working lockstep with President Trump since day one to restore America’s energy dominance and safeguard our economic and national security,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. “Thanks to the Trump Administration’s historic efforts to ‘DRILL, BABY, DRILL’, oil production hit an all-time record high in July while prices at the pump have fallen to the lowest in years.”\n \n\n   \n  Energy Department spokesman Ben Dietderich also pushed back on the idea that Wright’s standing was shaky. “Just last week, President Trump  called  Secretary Wright ‘the number one energy person anywhere in the world.’ No serious person is buying this anonymously sourced fake news,” Dietderich told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t the first time that a Cabinet secretary has appeared to be on thin ice in Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the possible replacement of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was  discussed at length  after the revelation that he had accidentally shared sensitive information on a Signal chain to which a reporter had been added. Over the summer, Trump  grew annoyed  with Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, over her stance on Iran’s nuclear capability.\n \n\n   \n  Both Hegseth and Gabbard have remained in their jobs, but pressure to replace Hegseth could resurface in the coming weeks as the Pentagon’s internal watchdog is expected to release its report on the Signal incident, which — while not carrying any formal sanction for the Defense Secretary — could return the issue to the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n    Youngkin in the wings?\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited out of office in January, is among the Republican leaders expected to be under consideration for any potential openings in the Cabinet or administration. While the president has praised Youngkin, several Republicans close to Trump say, the two men have not had a direct conversation about any prospective role.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin, who turns 59 next month, saw his endorsed successor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears,  defeated in a landslide  on Nov. 4 in an embarrassing loss for the governor and his fellow Republicans in the state.\n \n\n   \n  In a call with supporters before that election, Youngkin showered Trump with praise.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I want to thank you,” Youngkin said. “You’ve cut trade deals, peace deals, you’ve brought huge investments back to the United States. I know that you will always put America first.”\n \n\n   \n  The president responded in kind, calling Youngkin “one of the great governors in our country.” Trump added, “We’re very proud of you and the job you’ve done.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor has told allies that he would be excited by the prospect of joining the Cabinet, should a vacancy arise, but he has expressed more interest in an economic or business portfolio, rather than one focused on immigration. One longtime friend, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Youngkin would likely be reluctant to assume the reins of Trump’s aggressive deportation policies at the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been made clear that [Youngkin] is interested in working for the administration in some capacity,” one senior White House official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Youngkin did not respond to a request for comment about the governor’s plans when he leaves office in January.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin is weighing his political future, allies say, even though he is uncertain whether he could find a suitable opening to match his ambitions. He made summer trips to Iowa and South Carolina, two key stops in any Republican presidential primary, to meet party activists and keep his options open.\n \n\n   \n  Some Cabinet turnover is expected in any administration. During former President Joe Biden’s administration, the departments of Housing and Urban Development as well as Labor saw changes at the top, but neither vacancy occurred in the first two years.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/style/strauss-watch-titanic-auction-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:11:00-05:00","title":"Titanic Love Story: The Pocket Watch of Isidor and Ida Straus On Sale","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Isidor and Ida Straus, two of the highest-profile victims of the Titanic disaster, chose to die together rather than be separated, refusing to board lifeboat eight despite being offered seats.

up’: Trump set to host Mamdani at the White House \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:13 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As he celebrated a decisive victory earlier this month, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani made a direct appeal to President Donald Trump: “Since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!”\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders will hear each other loud and clear when they come face-to-face at the White House on Friday for their first meeting, which the mayor-elect has said he requested.\n \n\n   \n  And while it will offer an opportunity to try to forge a working relationship between the federal government and the new leader of the country’s most populous city, political tensions loom large.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone ahead of time, praising Mamdani’s win and predicting a “civil” meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “We meet at 3 o’clock today, and I think it’s going to be quite civil. We’ll find out,” Trump said in a radio interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s got a different philosophy. He’s a little bit different. I give him a lot of credit for the run. He did a successful run, and we all know that runs are not easy, but I think we’ll get along fine,” Trump added of the mayor-elect.\n \n\n   \n  Just a day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeated the president’s frequent line of attack during the mayoral campaign when asked about the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,” Leavitt told reporters Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump urged voters in his native city to back Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, over the GOP nominee. (Mamdani  has said  he is not a communist despite the White House’s claims.) Trump had also threatened to halt the city’s federal funding if Mamdani won, and indicated openness to  seizing control  of the city – which could put the mayor-elect’s agenda at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s not about myself, it’s not about a relationship with an individual. It’s about a relationship between New York City and the White House,” Mamdani told reporters on Thursday previewing the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor-elect spent much of Thursday preparing for the meeting, including by holding calls with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Rev. Al Sharpton to discuss how to approach it and how best to communicate with Trump, according to an aide to Mamdani’s transition team. He also spoke with Robert Wolf, the former CEO of UBS Americas and a known ally of former President Barack Obama, according to Wolf’s  post on social media .\n \n\n   \n  The face-to-face between the leader of the MAGA movement and the self-described democratic socialist comes after Mamdani secured a commanding victory — winning more than 50% of the vote — with a focus on working-class issues. His strong performance — coupled with Democratic gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia — has, in part, fueled Trump’s attacks on “affordability” as a Democratic “con job.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Thursday suggested affordability is at the top of his agenda for Friday’s discussions.\n \n\n   \n  “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I’ll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we’ve been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has  promised action  to make public buses free and reduce the cost of living, including by opening government-run grocery stores, freezing the rent for 1 million rent-stabilized tenants in the city, and a plan to create New York City’s first universal childcare program.\n \n\n   \n  According to CNN exit polling, 27% of voters in the mayoral election approved of Trump, compared to 70% who disapproved. And while a majority of voters in the overwhelmingly blue city — 58% — said that Trump was not a factor in their vote, 32% said they cast their ballots to express opposition to the president.\n \n\n   \n  There is, however, crossover in the Venn-Diagram of voters who supported both Trump in 2024 and Mamdani this year: 10% of Trump’s voters voted for Mamdani, according to CNN exit polling.\n \n\n   \n  The city, Leavitt said Thursday, is “becoming much more left than I think this president ever anticipated in his many years of living in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  But she cast the meeting as a reflection of Trump’s willingness to “meet with anyone and talk to anyone.” Asked whether the president could be persuaded to abandon his threat to cut federal funding to New York, she declined to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated that threat the day after the election, while offering a glimmer of collegiality. “I thought it was a very angry speech, certainly angry toward me. And I think he should be very nice to me. You know, I’m the one that sort of has to approve a lot of things coming to him, so he’s off to a bad start,” he told Fox News’ Bret Baier.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York. I really love New York,” the president added.\n \n\n   \n  But Mamdani also offers Trump — and his party — a political foil ahead of the 2026 midterms. The soon-to-be lame duck president, who has focused on rivals like former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, could make the mayor-to-be, who takes office January 1, his new boogeyman.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance, who may have his own higher political ambitions, has no interest in Friday’s get-together.\n \n\n   \n  “I might have a stomach bug,” he joked at a Thursday Breitbart News event.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s meeting with the president is taking place earlier than usual as he has not yet taken office. New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with Trump in the Oval Office in May 2025 and former Mayor Bill de Blasio met with him inside Trump Tower shortly after Trump was elected the first time in 2016. The meeting between Mamdani and Trump is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n  Trump indicated that the meeting, which is currently closed to press, will likely open to reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fine with me, I would think so. He’s a politician, so I don’t think he has a problem,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/americas/canada-grizzly-school-attack-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:09:00.000Z","title":"Grizzly Bear Attacks Schoolchildren and Teachers on Walking Trail in Canada, Injuring 11","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grizzly bear attacked a group of schoolchildren and teachers on a walking trail in Bella Coola, British Columbia, Canada, on Thursday, November 20, 2025, injuring 11 people, including two with critical injuries.

Fatima Bosch of Mexico has been named Miss Universe 2025 in a scandal-hit competition where she emerged as a fan favorite after she was  berated  by a Thai pageant director during a pre-pageant meeting, triggering a walk out by contestants.\n \n\n   \n  The 25-year-old humanitarian and volunteer was crowned by last year’s winner  Victoria Kjær Theilvig  from Denmark.\n \n\n   \n  Miss Universe is widely known as the “Super Bowl” of beauty pageants and draws millions of viewers each year. Delegates for each country are selected via local pageants that license local rights from the Miss Universe Organization.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Praveenar Singh came runner up, with Venezuela’s Stephany Abasali,  Philippines’ Ahtisa Manalo  and Ivory Coast’s Olivia Yacé also making it to the top 5.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand, this year’s host country, has a vibrant and lucrative pageant industry with one of the largest fanbases in Asia,  alongside the Philippines. \n \n\n   \n  The event featured representatives from 120 countries. Nadeen Ayoub became the first woman to represent  Palestinian people  at the pageant, and made it to the final 30 semifinalists before she was eliminated. Friday’s finale was hosted by American comedian Steve Byrne and opened with a performance by Thai singer Jeff Satur.\n \n\n   \n  Following the swimwear round, the top 30 contestants were narrowed down to 12, and then down to 5 after the evening round.\n \n\n   \n  Finalists were asked questions including which global issue they would speak about in front of the United Nations General Assembly, and how they would use the Miss Universe platform to empower young girls.\n \n\n   \n  “Believe in the power of your authenticity,” Bosch said. “Your dreams matter, your heart matters. Never let anyone make you doubt your worth.”\n \n\n   \n  The competition took place over three weeks, with delegates traveling around the country to rehearse and participate in events.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the beauty queens competed in the national costume showcase, which saw contestants donning flamboyant outfits designed to highlight their homelands. Miss USA, Audrey Eckert, paid homage to her home with an  elaborate bald eagle costume  designed by Simon Villalba.\n \n\n   \n  The contestant from Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, took a scary tumble during the evening gown round at Wednesday’s preliminaries and was carried away in a stretcher, according to social media videos which circulated of her fall. Miss Universe President Raul Rocha said in an  update to Instagram  that Henry was “under good care” in hospital and that she had not broken any bones.\n \n\n   \n    Pageant controversies\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Miss Universe competition was beset by controversy and internal drama in the weeks leading up to coronation night. The walk out sparked conversations over the merits of the international beauty pageant which claims to promote female empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  At a live-streamed pre-pageant meeting earlier this month, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly scolded Bosch ,  for not posting enough promotional content, appearing to call her a “dumbhead,” though Nawat denied this, insisting that he had actually accused her of causing “damage.”\n \n\n   \n  After Bosch pushed back against the insults, Nawat called security to escort her out of the room. Other contestants then stood up and walked out in solidarity.\n \n\n   \n  The incident drew global backlash, including from Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum, who described it as an “aggression” that Bosch handled with “dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum congratulated Bosch for winning the Miss Universe title during her morning press conference in Mexico City on Friday, praising the beauty queen for standing up to one of the competition hosts.\n \n\n   \n  “What I liked about her, aside from everything else, is that she speaks up when she feels there’s an injustice against her,” Sheinbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s an example for all Mexicans and for women…those old sayings at rallies, like ‘you look prettier when you’re quiet,’ are behind us,” Sheinbaum added.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization condemned Nawat’s behavior and limited his role in the pageant. Nawat apologized in a livestreamed welcome ceremony and declined to comment further on the incident to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, Miss Universe 1996, Alicia Machado, was criticized for making racist comments in an Instagram live video discussing the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Machado referred to Nawat as “that despicable Chinese,” and when a commentor pointed out he is Thai, Machado said “Chinese, Thai, Korean. To me all these people with slanted eyes like this are all Chinese,” while pulling up the corners of her eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s representative did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Judge steps down, says pageant is rigged\n \n\n   \n  Two judges abruptly stepped down from the competition days before the winner was crowned, with one accusing the pageant of being rigged.\n \n\n   \n  Composer Omar Harfouch said on Instagram he had resigned from the eight-member judging panel, and claimed there was a secret, “impromptu” panel of judges who had pre-selected the top 30 contestants in advance of the final.\n \n\n   \n  “I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,” Harfouch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization said Harfouch’s claims “mischaracterize” the judging process.\n \n\n   \n  “The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,” the organization said in a  statement. \n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A second judge, former French soccer star Claude Makélélé, stepped down the same day, citing “unforeseen personal reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard,” he said  on Instagram .\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization saw a leadership shakeup after Thai media tycoon Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip stepped down in June. Mario Búcaro was  appointed the new CEO  at the end of October, just days before delegates arrived. Jakkaphong, who is also a transgender rights advocate,  bought the organization for $20 million in 2022 , but her company  filed for bankruptcy  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Next year’s Miss Universe contest will take place in Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n   This article was updated with results and details of the competition.

backlash \n       \n  By Michael Williams, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:53 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Coast Guard on Thursday issued a memo that reclassifies swastikas and nooses as “hate symbols,” in a rapid about-face after facing intense scrutiny for a previous policy change which downplayed their display as merely “potentially divisive.”\n \n\n   \n  The  newest memo  expressly prohibits the display of nooses, swastikas or “any symbols or flags co-opted or adopted by hate-based groups as representations of supremacy, racial or religious intolerance, anti-semitism, or any other improper bias.”\n \n\n   \n  It was released hours after  The Washington Post reported  that the Coast Guard had approved a policy that downgraded the way the symbols, which are some of the most recognizable emblems of racism and antisemitism, had previously been classified.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, Coast Guard policy had said displaying the symbols “constitutes a potential hate incident.” In the  updated policy  first  reported by The Post  on Thursday, and issued by the Coast Guard last week, that language had been changed to referring to those symbols simply as “potentially divisive.” That policy had been set to take effect in December.\n \n\n   \n  The  newest policy , released yesterday, says: “Divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited.” It lists swastikas, nooses and other emblems that have been adopted or co-opted by hate groups.\n \n\n   \n  The reversal came amid heavy criticism that the Coast Guard, a military branch which falls under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security, was downplaying the display of insignia which imply support for some of the darkest moments in human history.\n \n\n   \n  DHS denied it had changed its policy before the Coast Guard issued the apparent reversal. An agency spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, also denied in a post to social media on Friday that the Coast Guard was “backtracking” by issuing the latest memo.\n \n\n   \n  “The 2025 policy is not changing—USCG issued a lawful order that doubles down on our *current* policies prohibiting the display, distribution or use of hate symbols by Coast Guard personnel,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nooses symbolize the legacy of  racial hatred and terror  in the United States that saw thousands of Black people lynched between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. Swastikas epitomize Adolf Hitler’s murderous regime in Nazi Germany, which killed millions of people during the Holocaust and sparked a war in which more than 400,000 American service members — including about 1,900 who served in the Coast Guard — also died.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Lauren Underwood, an Illinois Democrat, said she met with the Coast Guard’s acting commandant, Admiral Kevin Lunday, to express concerns about the update to the policy. She said she received a commitment from him that the policy would change and become more restrictive.\n \n\n   \n  “He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,” Underwood said in a  video statement .\n \n\n   \n  Lunday also insisted in a statement Thursday that swastikas and other “extremist imagery” remain prohibited in the Coast Guard.\n \n\n   \n  “Any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished,” he said. “Symbols such as swastikas, nooses and other extremist or racist imagery violate our core values and are treated with the seriousness they warrant under current policy.”\n \n\n   \n  The military at times  has struggled  with combatting extremism among their service members. A  2020 Pentagon report  found that extremist views were not widespread in the military, but said the issue was still urgent due to the ability of people with military experience to carry out “high-impact events.”\n \n\n   \n  During President Joe Biden’s term, Secretary of Defense  Lloyd Austin  in 2021 ordered a staggered pause in operations across the military so commanders could have discussions with their service members about the issue of extremism.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed the idea of there being an issue with extremism in the military. During  his confirmation hearing  in January, Hegseth said a focus on extremism has “created a climate inside our ranks that feel political when it hasn’t ever been political.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/trump-ukraine-peace-gaza-witkoff","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Rushes to Emulate Gaza Plan in New Push for Ukraine Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is rushing to implement a new peace framework for Ukraine, directly modeled after its successful Gaza ceasefire deal.

administration rushes to emulate Gaza plan in new push for Ukraine Deal \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:47 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Believing they have  a new window of opportunity  to restart peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump administration officials are rushing ahead with a new framework to end the Ukraine war modeled after the Gaza deal President Donald Trump pushed, despite little initial input from Ukrainian or European allies, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  The push to restart talks reemerged as a top priority for the president in recent weeks — shortly after the US helped broker a ceasefire in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has indicated he wants to expedite the timeline for ending the war in Ukraine, hoping to conclude a conflict he once said publicly would be the easily resolved, the sources added. Some US officials have said that the administration wants Russia and Ukraine to agree to a deal by the end of the year, according to two sources.\n \n\n   \n  Like the proposal the Trump administration crafted which led to the  ceasefire in Gaza , the Ukraine plan reads as a listicle of bullet points, laying out commitments each side would make in order to drive a lasting end to the conflict. Both proposals call for the halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing war, now approaching its fourth year, has fueled the frustrations of a US president who regularly touts his dealmaking ability and believes he has not received enough credit for overseeing other recent diplomatic successes, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, several top Trump administration officials have turned their focus back to the  war in Ukraine  and the US has considered enlisting some of the same foreign intermediaries who helped facilitate negotiations related to Gaza – including Qatar and Turkey – to play a more prominent, but still behind the scenes, diplomatic role, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the similarities to the Gaza ceasefire deal that appeared in the Ukraine framework for peace that emerged on Thursday, which US officials cautioned was not a final proposal, were very stark. Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, which is being overseen by a Trump-led “Board of Peace,” the draft proposal describes the Ukraine peace implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump,” according to a draft seen by CNN. The draft’s veracity was confirmed by a US official.\n \n\n   \n  The draft also included components that Russian diplomats have pushed and Ukrainian officials have previously rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the 28-point plan includes elements such as territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia, a limit on the size of Ukraine’s armed forces and a Ukrainian commitment in its constitution that it will not join NATO, the draft said. Reports emerged earlier this week that President Trump’s top envoy Steve Witkoff was working with Russia on the framework, which includes the Russian maximalist demands.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff has been working with Russian Special Envoy and the head of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund Kirill Dmitriev directly for many months and the two have remained engaged in crafting this new draft proposal, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As Europeans monitored reports that emerged on Tuesday that Witkoff had worked exclusively with Russian officials to develop the plan, some were on edge, according to six sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Europeans who said they had not been briefed on the details grew concerned about what the effort could mean for Ukraine – given their longstanding position that Ukraine must be involved in any discussions about a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Wednesday night, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tweeted that ending the war would require “an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas.” Rubio added that the Trump administration would continue “to develop a list of potential ideas” to end the Ukraine war, without saying any final proposal was being floated.\n \n\n   \n  Some Europeans let out a collective sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday nerves were up, today nerves are down,” said a diplomat based in Brussels on Thursday, explaining that Rubio’s tweet had appeared to chill the idea that a firm new deal was on the table that the US would be urging Ukraine to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “The president lets hundreds of flowers bloom,” the diplomat added, pointing to the possibility that the efforts could have been driven by Witkoff freelancing, but also noting that he is one of few people who has the official green-light do that from the president.\n \n\n   \n  A senior State Department official said that Rubio “was reiterating a point he has made for months – a diplomatic end to the war requires both sides to make concessions, and that cannot happen without ongoing dialogue.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that both Witkoff and Rubio “have been working on a plan quietly for about the last month.” She would not go into details of the plan, saying that it’s “ongoing” and “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt acknowledged that the administration was taking cues from its playbook on the Gaza ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff and Rubio, she said, have “been engaging with both sides, Russia and Ukraine equally, to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you get to a peace negotiation, right? That’s how it worked with Israel, with respect to Israel and Gaza and all of the Arab countries in the Middle East,” she said at a press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The new push comes just after  recent reports of corruption  inside Ukraine, which some administration officials believe leaves the Ukrainian government in a weakened state, and some Europeans are concerned about the US seeking to leverage that weakness.\n \n\n   \n  Still, other Europeans diplomats believe that a continued push towards a peace agreement is useful. One European diplomat explained that they viewed Witkoff’s current efforts as a natural evolution of continued US strategy to drive a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to look at it as an evolution of a negotiation. You take out points, dial up points… the two sides won’t get an agreement overnight,” the European said.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has not publicly endorsed the ongoing efforts. The Kremlin denied it is working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine this week, saying Thursday there were “no new developments” following a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if Russia and the US are currently working towards an end to the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that “there are no consultations as such currently underway. There are certainly contacts. But there is no process that could be called consultations. It is not ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  As of last week, Rubio still publicly said his assessment was Russia did not want peace.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve stated clearly what they want is they want the rest of Donetsk, and obviously the Ukrainians aren’t going to agree to that,” he told reporters after a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the assessment we have to make,” he said. “They’ve made a demand that Ukraine can’t agree to, and so that’s sort of where we are at this point.”\n \n\n   \n  When the top US diplomat spoke with his Russian counterpart by phone last month, officials felt that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, a source familiar with the matter said at the time. Potential meetings between Rubio and Lavrov and Trump and Putin did not move forward, despite Trump saying just a week prior that he planned to meet the Russian president.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials said that the reported plan is not the final product, and the fact that it has a number of items that had been pushed by Russia and previously rejected by Ukraine does not mean that is the expectation for an agreement at the end of the ongoing talks – including talks with Ukrainians.\n \n\n   \n  The plan was presented on Thursday to the Ukrainians by the Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, two sources said. While his trip to Ukraine was previously scheduled, it was an opportunity to share the current thinking on the revived push to end the war, the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian presidential office did not outright reject the current US efforts, saying Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, who becomes the primary Trump administration point person for the Ukrainians as the administration pushes – again – for a peace deal remains unclear. Throughout the last year, Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, has served as the chief Trump administration official communicating with the Ukrainians. But in recent months he has privately told people that he plans to depart early next year, which could leave a significant void until that role is filled.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-analysis-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:19:00-05:00","title":"Trump is giving Russia almost everything it wants with his Ukraine peace plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked draft of President Donald Trump’s 28-point Ukraine peace plan, co-conceived by Russian officials and widely dismissed by Ukrainians and Europeans, presents a series of maximalist demands that significantly favor Russia.

almost everything it wants with his Ukraine peace plan \n       \n  Analysis by Nick Paton Walsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:19 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trying the same thing over and over again, without success, is either the definition of insanity or  Russian  negotiation tactics, depending on your point of view.\n \n\n   \n  The widely leaked draft of  President Donald Trump’s 28-point plan  is a terrifying leap backwards for Kyiv. It was co-conceived by Russians who wanted to pretend they were engaging in peace, and circulated by Ukrainians and Europeans who felt it was so ridiculous it would surely die on first contact with oxygen.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the text resembles the maximalist  positions Russia held during talks in Istanbul in 2022 when its forces held more of Ukraine, and the slow, grinding    military embarrassment of the past three years was still ahead of them. Before we dissect the text - and its profound, dizzying advantages for the Kremlin - the timing of this renewed, mostly Moscow-initiated plan, is key.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s forces are perhaps in their best position for about a year.   They are weeks, even days, away from taking the embattled eastern military hub of Pokrovsk, a place of outsized significance and great strategic import, grimly fought over since last summer. Their forces are at  its southern edges, and if they take it would  encounter few sizeable population centers to their west that are under Ukrainian control before they near the capital, Kyiv. That land is mostly flat and open, ideal for a swift advance. Moscow has also had a breakout across Zaporizhzhia region, using armor and moving its forces perilously close to Zaporizhzhia city, taking, again, open and flat territory that will remain vulnerable during winter.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine continues to see high desertion rates and draft-avoidance, adding to its serious manpower issues and Kyiv’s drone advantage has been eroded by swift Russian learning and innovation. President Volodymyr Zelensky is also suffering a popularity nadir – facing the repercussions of an ongoing and intimately detailed corruption scandal that touches both his inner circle and the very thing Ukrainians must endure daily – energy outages.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian initiative is obviously set to exploit Ukraine’s moment of perhaps unprecedented vulnerability   – when a domestic political crisis threatens to hobble Zelensky in confronting frontline emergencies. The appalling timing for Kyiv may also explain why Moscow has bothered to – yet again – present a series of maximalist demands that Ukraine and its allies have also flatly and repeatedly dismissed. One European diplomat   described it as Groundhog Day. But in the movie, the rub of that day on repeat was not that it became predictable and tedious, but that you were forced to constantly relive it.\n \n\n   \n  The 28 leaked points serve two purposes for Moscow. They present a starting block that is so advantageous that even achieving parts of it would be a huge win. And they also provide an edifice to which Russian diplomats can constantly return if they wish to, yet again, slow-roll diplomacy while their military has the advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Demands that Ukraine constitutionally reject NATO membership, de-Nazify, guarantee its neutrality and limit the size of its armed forces were in the Istanbul 2022 document. Then, at the height of the Russian invasion’s initial ambition they were an amorphous set of maximalist terms that amounted to a form of Ukrainian surrender.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has survived formidably since that gambit but has been weakened by the fight.\n \n\n   \n  The use of $100 billion in frozen Russian funds to rebuild Ukraine appears, on the surface, to be a Russian concession. Yet the most brutalized parts of Ukraine are under Russian occupation, and this money would go to Russia to execute the rebuild under its terms. The deal proposes that half of any reconstruction profits would somehow go to the United States, and some of the money would be invested in other joint US-Russian projects. The scope for Moscow getting much of this cash back is vast, and the deal also proposes that international sanctions be lifted entirely, which would be a huge financial boon of its own.\n \n\n   \n  There are three other hidden shards of glass in this repeat serving of Russian diplomatic porridge. First is the demand for elections 100 days after a deal’s signature.\n \n\n   \n  This is, by most accounts, technically impossible given the challenges of demobilization, war-time logistics and legal reform. A rushed, poorly executed poll would be the outcome, yielding a government of questionable legitimacy and providing a space for misinformation and manipulation large enough for the Russians to drive another tank through, with their preferred candidate sat on top. Zelensky cannot accept this deadline, and a snap election was a Russian canard from earlier this year that the Trump administration seemed to drop. Its revival – and with it, discussion of Zelensky’s shelf life – re-emerges at a time of new weakness for this wartime leader.\n \n\n   \n  Second is the confusing concept of turning the parts of the eastern Donbas region currently under Ukrainian control into a demilitarized zone that is technically part of Russia. This amounts to surrendering them to Russian “civilian” forces. This is terrain Moscow would otherwise have to bitterly fight for over the next year. Even a compromise of declaring this area a demilitarized zone, from which the militaries of both sides are barred, feeds into Russia’s rich history of using “people’s militias” to infiltrate territory and declare a popular revolt in Moscow’s favor.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky cannot cede the city of Kramatorsk. It would yield Russian President Vladimir Putin a military bulwark from which to launch another, easier attack toward Kyiv across open ground, perhaps within months. It would open Zelensky up to internal political challenges. Moscow knows this, but keeps going back to it in the hope that eventually Trump is ground down into seeing this concession as a necessary part of any solution.\n \n\n   \n  Thirdly, the wording of the circulated deal is vague, and seems at times to be rush-translated from Russian or Ukrainian, containing several “snapback” clauses. One says Ukraine’s security guarantees will be “deemed invalid” if they fire a missile at “Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause” – a caveat of great consequence and breadth of interpretation. Russia will have a different view of what “cause” is great enough to that held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also demands all “Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected or prohibited” in Ukraine, a repeat of the Russian false talking –point that it is facing a Kyiv government run by Nazi extremists. Would the appearance of a far-right flag on a Ukrainian unit, or an SS Death’s Head emblem in an unofficial military Telegram page, suddenly void the deal? In its current form, the deal is something Moscow can walk out on at any time, with slim justification.\n \n\n   \n  If there is any Russian error in this document, it is not in its timing, or blunt obstinacy, but in its clear exposition that Moscow retains most of its maximalist demands as its starting point. That has in the past angered Trump, and indeed resulted in the most severe sanctions imposed yet by the US on Russia, against oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  But the Kremlin has correctly seen its steep advances on the battlefield, Ukraine’s domestic turbulence and serious frontline fragility, Europe’s concerns about how long it can fund Kyiv’s defense, and Trump’s overwhelming hunger for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2026, and tried to make the old sound new again.\n \n\n   \n  If it buys time, it works. If a third of it sticks, or becomes the lexicon of any future deal, it works. In the past year, almost everything else has been tried once.

Inside the store, rows of tortillas and shoulder-high stacks of canned hominy sit largely untouched, while the jewelry and travel kiosks are dark.\n \n\n   \n  A phone rings inside the store’s main office, and seconds later, Duran’s manager comes out. It was a tipster with intel that just a week ago  would have sounded  implausible:\n \n\n   \n   Suspected Customs and Border Patrol vehicles have been seen at a gas station a couple of blocks away. \n \n\n   \n  The manager walks over to the store’s entry and stands watch, ready to lock the front door at the first sign of federal agents. Her friendly eyes turn slightly dark.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t have no right to be in here,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  All along Central Avenue, the heart of this immigrant business community in East Charlotte, stark black-and-white signs now posted outside most businesses warn: “ICE is not welcome here.”\n \n\n   \n  The immigration action called Operation  Charlotte’s Web  has shocked and frightened the community, with hundreds of arrests and dozens of minority-owned businesses closed out of fear for their customers and their workers. Manolo’s Bakery, one of the most popular businesses in the neighborhood,  shuttered Saturday  after people were tackled outside the store by men in green uniforms.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte is the latest stop in a virtual four-corners tour of the country by Border Patrol Chief Control Agent  Gregory Bovino  and his agents, who this year have made weekslong visits to Los Angeles and Chicago, with  New Orleans  expected next. In contrast to their Windy City presence, Bovino and at least some of his team  left Charlotte  on Thursday, a Homeland Security official said, as elevated immigration enforcement continues.\n \n\n   \n  The strong shows of force against migrants in Democratic-led cities have become a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s intense immigration enforcement agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In the Charlotte area, more than 250 people were  arrested  over four days of immigration raids, the Department of Homeland Security  said  Wednesday. “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the agency  said .\n \n\n   \n  “Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin  said  in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, a protest outside Manolo’s against the federal effort builds throughout the day, growing to dozens of people and stretching the strip mall’s small parking lot to its limits.\n \n\n   \n    As popular bakery closes, community rises in support\n \n\n   \n  The demonstration began with just one man.\n \n\n   \n  Jerry Ortiz stands  alongside Central Avenue , waving a massive Puerto Rican flag featuring a tree frog called the coquí – with a songlike call that sounds like its name – as passing drivers honk their support. The frog, a native of Puerto Rico like Ortiz himself, is an important symbol of the island’s culture.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the car horns are music to his ears.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s beautiful,” Ortiz says.\n \n\n   \n  But not every note of Central Avenue’s cacophony supports his message.\n \n\n   \n  “Get them illegal sons of bitches out of here!” yells the passenger in one truck as it passes Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not an entirely surprising message in a county where  a third  of the votes cast in the last presidential election were for Donald Trump. Ortiz shrugs.\n \n\n   \n  “Something is wrong that they don’t appreciate us here,” he says. “We come here to work hard, to make this country better.”\n \n\n   \n  While Ortiz keeps watch along the street,  bakery owner  Manolo Betancur stops by several times a day to make sure federal agents haven’t returned and to talk to the growing crowd that cheers loudly as he raises a large American flag alongside the coquí.\n \n\n   \n  “My biggest concern right now is our children need to have their fathers and mothers next to them,” Betancur says.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of these people are so scared, they’re not going to have Thanksgiving (dinner),” adds Ortiz, standing a few feet from the locked entrance to Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  Even as the fear forced Betancur to close his business, supporters are still paying for cakes from Manolo’s through the bakery’s website. He contacts them to make sure they understand he can’t fulfill the order right now.\n \n\n   \n  “They say, ‘No, it’s a donation,’” says Betancur.\n \n\n   \n  More protesters show up outside Manolo’s as midday approaches. Brandi Yanes is supporting people who now feel the pain she felt in 2018, when her husband was  detained by ICE  after a sheriff’s office identified him as undocumented following an altercation at a bar, she says.\n \n\n   \n  “Once he came home, my daughter was 6 months old. He had four months with us, and then he had to self-deport to Honduras,” Yanes says.\n \n\n   \n  Though they talk on the phone almost daily, Yanes’ daughter – now almost 8 years old – hasn’t seen her father in person in two years.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, with (immigration agents) being back here, and she’s seeing what’s going on, she’s waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning, crying,” says Yanes. “She’s asking, ‘Are my friends going to be OK?’”\n \n\n   \n  Betancur looks on at the crowd, growing to dozens by midafternoon, with appreciation.\n \n\n   \n  “If it weren’t for the immigrant community, I wouldn’t have a business,” says Betancur. “They are my customers. They are my employees.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the economic losses he is facing, Betancur has the one thing that is priceless for any immigrant: citizenship. He now carries his US passport with him everywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n    Immigrants made the community what it is, neighbors say\n \n\n   \n  Dianna Ward gave up a high-paying corporate career to start her own tour business, and she knows how to weave in history lessons at Charlotte’s hot spots. But when showing off the Plaza Midwood neighborhood where she lives, she chooses an unlikely starting point:  Evergreen Cemetery .\n \n\n   \n  “Look over here,” she says, pointing to a row of headstones from the 1940s. “It’s all Greek.” Other graves show the names of Italian and Jewish residents who helped build the community.\n \n\n   \n  “This has always been an immigrant community,” says Ward. “Immigrants claimed it and have done a beautiful job of making this a place you want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Ward points to million-dollar historic homes, Vietnamese restaurants, an Irish pub and bohemian art as signs of her  neighborhood’s diversity .\n \n\n   \n  “But this is my favorite place,” she says while passing the Central Avenue location of Tacos El Nevado. It is noon, and the restaurant is completely dark, chairs stacked up on the tables.\n \n\n   \n  “It is usually so packed in this restaurant, but look at it now.”\n \n\n   \n    Some stores stay open, even with fewer workers and customers\n \n\n   \n  With the earlier  threat of federal agents  turning out to be false alarm, things pick up a bit by midday at the Sav/Way, where the bustling lunch counter is serving up massive tortas piled impossibly high with meat and jalapeños.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike an average day before Operation Charlotte’s Web, there is no 30-minute wait to be served.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we lose money, we need to keep it open if we can,” says Sav/Way owner Rudy Montero, whose weathered face and gray moustache are the only visible signs of his 72 years. After decades of seven-day weeks running the store, Montero still comes every day to take deliveries and energetically supervise.\n \n\n   \n  “You need to be positive all the time,” says Montero. “I feel terrible about this, but we need to keep going.”\n \n\n   \n  Montero’s positivity is matched by one of his most enthusiastic lunch counter customers, Jesse Pacheco-Anguiano. Wearing a beaded crucifix over the number “7” on his shirt in honor of Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, he gives new visitors the lowdown on his favorites.\n \n\n   \n  “The Cubana is a big, big torta,” he emphasizes. “Do you have a big appetite?”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano is a home renovation contractor who  depends on day laborers , including a worker he saw being picked up by Border Patrol agents in their now-familiar green uniforms and facemasks at a Lowe’s on Saturday, the first day of the Charlotte operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I was born and raised here in Charlotte my whole life, and this is the first time in my life I’ve seen this happen,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano says the agents left him alone after checking his driver’s license, but agents drove away with his worker in two unmarked crossovers, leaving a half-loaded stack of lumber still sticking out of the back of the customized work van with the name of his business covering both sides.\n \n\n   \n  “Look at this. They’re embarrassing me,” he says in Spanish in a cell phone video of the encounter he took and shared with CNN. DHS has not responded to CNN’s questions about this incident.\n \n\n   \n    The crackdown becomes a costly burden on small businesses\n \n\n   \n  With his business effectively shut down, Pacheco-Anguiano joins the protesters when he can. Starting his own business was a long-time dream, and he wants to use what he has to help those who can’t speak up.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just trying to protest for my people who don’t have a voice, and I’m here for them,” Pacheco-Anguiano says.\n \n\n   \n  The full economic impact of the immigration enforcement operation is not clear, but CharlotteEAST, a nonprofit community organization, says small businesses  are struggling .\n \n\n   \n  “For a little tienda, (it’s costing) $400 a day. A hair salon, $500. A restaurant, $5,000 a day,” says the executive director, Greg Asciutto.\n \n\n   \n  His group looks out for about 400 mom-and-pop businesses in East Charlotte, about half of them owned by immigrants, Asciutto says.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, our whole commercial thoroughfare is shut down, right?” he says. “And these are American citizens. These are American-owned businesses.”\n \n\n   \n  The economic strain is showing not just on business owners but also on workers. Even as the immigration raids go on, Pacheco-Anguiano continues to get calls from workers asking for a gig, telling him they have no choice as their money begins to dry up, he says.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re willing to take the risk, but I’m like, ‘Dude, I can’t have that on my conscience if anything happens on the way from here to your house,’” says Pacheco-Anguiano.\n \n\n   \n    Community members show support with their dollars\n \n\n   \n  With Manolo’s Bakery closed, Pacheco-Anguiano moves down Central Avenue to Panadería Odalys, where traditional Latino pastries sit alongside doughnuts and slices of vanilla-iced cake with sprinkles, loading up a pan of treats for family and friends.\n \n\n   \n  About half of the display cases are  uncharacteristically empty , a sign of the difficulty owner Cervantes Almanza is having in finding enough staff who feel safe going to work. But he points to the 5-foot-high racks of baked goods just rolled out into the center of the store.\n \n\n   \n  “Have some. They’re fresh!” says Almanza in Spanish, an announcement made redundant by the aroma that quickly fills the room.\n \n\n   \n  A new customer is unprepared for the store’s cash-only policy, but Almanza gives a silent wave and head shake to show this one is on the house, his gratitude for the community’s support. (A veteran Odalys customer quietly slips money over the counter to pay the bill while Almanza isn’t looking.)\n \n\n   \n  Since Lolo Pendergrast found out Odalys was open but struggling with a reduced staff, she buys as many pastries as she can stuff into an oversized delivery box.\n \n\n   \n  “I got a whole bunch now, and I’m just going around town and handing them out to protesters,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  Pendergrast is retired from teaching English as a Second Language at Merry Oaks International Academy, a public elementary school.\n \n\n   \n  “The people that live right next to it, they’re our friends, our neighbors, you know, and they’re not illegal,” said Pendergrast. “I do not understand how we’ve gotten so off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n    Keeping an eye out for the ‘ Migra’ \n \n\n   \n  Almanza stays vigilant, looking out his bakery’s front door. His workers pick up on a sudden change in mood that takes the air out of the room. The owner doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to.\n \n\n   \n  As Almanza quietly slides the door open for a closer look,  a panicked voice  shouts from behind the building.\n \n\n   \n  “ Migra !  Migra !” a woman yells, feverishly ringing a cowbell.\n \n\n   \n  She runs fast through a residential street into the back of the Odalys parking lot, tailing a pair of unmarked vehicles that quickly blast a siren at oncoming traffic before making sharp right turns onto Central Avenue. Another vehicle follows, with a protester lying on the horn.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to make sure everybody’s good,” the woman says, now leaning over with a hand on one knee to catch her breath before returning to work.\n \n\n   \n  The Odalys employees  feel some relief  as they go back to their jobs, but a reminder of the toll this is taking on the neighborhood remains just outside their windows. Next door, the popular Salvadoran restaurant Morazán remains closed, the parking lot empty.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m born and raised in East Charlotte,” says neighbor Jorge Neri-Moreno, standing next to the shuttered restaurant, “and seeing all this breaks my heart.”\n \n\n   \n    Some children skip class, and volunteers try to keep schools safe\n \n\n   \n  Outside Shamrock Gardens Elementary School, parents Patricia Hoke and Laura Blum sit in lawn chairs at the entrance on Anne Street, a large handwritten poster next to them saying, “NO ICE.” They’re part of a network of volunteers waiting outside  local schools  during drop-off and pickup hours with whistles around their necks, watching for federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea is if we see them, we alert,” Blum says. “And I think it’s just a presence for people to know their community’s behind them.”\n \n\n   \n  There have been no immigration raids outside Charlotte schools so far, but the mothers’ work mixes a strong sense of purpose with a lingering sense of paranoia.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone feels on edge, even though it’s quiet,” says Hoke.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students – about 20% of district enrollment – were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said.\n \n\n   \n  To make sure as many East Charlotte schools as possible are covered, many parent volunteers are now communicating using encrypted messaging apps, just in case they’re being monitored themselves.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned to use Signal yesterday,” says Blum with a slight smile.\n \n\n   \n    Some businesses stay open – but locked up\n \n\n   \n  Before getting back to the protests – his new job for the time being – Pacheco-Anguiano has one more stop to make, pulling his work van into the parking lot at La Reina de las Carnitas, where the smell of fried pork and freshly made tortillas usually draws an overflow crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Owner Ricardo Albarrán immediately gives Pacheco-Anguiano a smile and a fatherly arm around the shoulder. The visitor didn’t just come here for food. Just a few years earlier, Pacheco-Anguiano worked here before striking out on his own with the renovation business. Now, he wants to  check up on  his old boss.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán says he closed at 2 p.m. on the day Operation Charlotte’s Web started and stayed closed through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On the first day he tried to reopen the shop, only two employees showed up for work. The rest were too afraid. Now, Albarrán keeps the front deadbolt latched until a worker at the door is comfortable that whoever is approaching is a customer.\n \n\n   \n  “Every business is doing the same thing to protect the people,” he says in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán sees would-be customers doing their own surveillance, trying to figure out whether an officer in the parking lot, or even just an SUV with tinted windows, might be from Border Patrol, making the short trip from a car to his door too risky.\n \n\n   \n  “ ¿Sí o no? ¿Sí o no? ” they seem to be asking themselves as they assess the level of danger, he says.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán has  enormous pride  in his business, he says as he begins speaking in English for emphasis.\n \n\n   \n  “I came from Mexico, and this is my dream,” he says. “All countries have good people. I don’t know why (this is happening).”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano gets another pat on the shoulder and heads out, happy to see his old workplace has been able to stay in operation. But as he exits the carnicería, the sound of the door lock clicking behind him is a stark reminder of the reality his community is still facing.\n \n\n   \n  “You know how they say they come for criminals?” he asks. “I think that’s not right. Because we’re here just trying to get a job done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dianne Gallagher and Lacey Russell contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/sport/football-nfl-texans-bills-week-12-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:38:00-05:00","title":"Referee Carted Off Field with Injury as Texans’ Defense Roughs Up Buffalo Bills to Give Houston Big Upset Win","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a dramatic and physically taxing NFL matchup on November 21, 2025, the Houston Texans defeated the Buffalo Bills 23-19 in a high-stakes game at NRG Stadium.

\n  By Patrick Sung, Jill Martin, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:38 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thursday night’s  NFL  game between the Houston Texans and Buffalo Bills was a rough and tumble affair, featuring injuries aplenty – including to one of the officials.\n \n\n   \n  Referee Adrian Hill had to be carted off the field following a non-contact injury in the third quarter of the Texans’ 23-19 win at NRG Stadium. Hill came up limping after a play and the game was stopped as medical staff looked him over before it was decided he would leave the contest.\n \n\n   \n  The referee, who was leading the officiating crew on the night, was replaced by umpire Roy Ellison, eliminating the  umpire position  for the remainder of the game.\n \n\n   \n  The rest of the evening was no less bruising, as the Texans’ vaunted defense – entering Thursday night No. 1 in scoring defense and total defense – lived up to its reputation by battering Bills QB Josh Allen and the rest of the Buffalo offense throughout the contest.\n \n\n   \n  Allen – who was coming off an  incredible six-touchdown performance  on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – had a rough night, completing 24-of-34 passes for 253 yards with two interceptions and no touchdowns and also being sacked a  career-worst eight times .\n \n\n   \n  Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said, “Credit goes to, first and foremost, our defensive line. For the way they go out, the way those guys relentlessly rush the passer and everybody on the back end is playing sound and playing together.\n \n\n   \n  “When we do that, we’re tough to move the ball against, so our players are doing an outstanding job.”\n \n\n   \n  Texans safety Calen Bullock was the standout player on the night, forcing three turnovers – two picks and a forced fumble – including the game-sealing interception with 24 seconds left in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n    Explosive first half\n \n\n   \n  The game started well for the Bills, with Buffalo taking an early 6-0 lead after James Cook cut through the middle of the Texans defense for an incredible 45-yard touchdown run.\n \n\n   \n  The teams exchanged field goals before Houston – which was playing without starting quarterback CJ Stroud for the third straight game due to concussion protocol – got a boost from its backup signal-calle. Davis Mills  threw a short, two-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Christian Kirk to put the Texans up 10-9 after the extra point.\n \n\n   \n  Bullock then nabbed his first interception of the evening, running it back for an apparent touchdown, only for a flag to have been thrown on the play on defensive end Danielle Hunter for blocking in the back. Houston ultimately settled for another field goal to extend the lead, but Buffalo hit right back off an explosive special teams play.\n \n\n   \n  Ray Davis caught the ensuing kickoff, clanging off a teammate and rolling to one side, before returning it 97 yards and front flipping into the end zone to put the Bills back on top with 1:43 left in the half.\n \n\n   \n  The fireworks weren’t done yet in the Lone Star State as the Texans ran a two-minute drill to perfection, with Mills throwing his second touchdown of the day to Jayden Higgins to cap off a six-play, 75-yard drive to put Houston up 20-16 at the half.\n \n\n   \n    Crunchtime heroics\n \n\n   \n  The third quarter began slowly with neither team doing much before Bullock came up big again. The Houston safety forced a fumble from Bills wideout Khalil Shakir after he made a catch with 4:15 left in the quarter, leading to yet another field goal from Texans kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn to make it 23-16 in favor of the home team.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills cut the lead to four after getting a field goal with 5:44 left in the game, and then came crunchtime.\n \n\n   \n  With 49 seconds left, Allen threw a pass on fourth-and-27 to Josh Palmer who then lateraled it to Shakir to convert and get the Bills dangerously close to the red zone and make the Texans faithful begin to worry.\n \n\n   \n  After a nine-yard run sandwiched between two incompletions, Buffalo was facing another fourth down with the game on the line and Allen lined up in a shotgun formation. The defending league MVP dropped back and threw off his back foot, but the ball was intercepted by Houston hero Bullock, who sealed the contest with his pick.\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Texans coach Ryans expressed his relief at how the game ended, praising Bullock for his heroics: “Calen went out and intercepted the ball two times, forcing a fumble to get us in plus territory there.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of emotions going on on the sideline through that entire (final) drive, but for Calen to come down with that interception was my favorite play – because it meant it was over.”\n \n\n   \n  “A dream come true showing up on a stage like Thursday night. We are the only team on, everybody watching, the whole world watching, so a dream come true,” Bullock – who received the game ball for his performance –  told ESPN .\n \n\n   \n  With the win, Houston moves to 6-5 on the season, third in the AFC South, while the Bills drop to 7-4 and second in the AFC East, where they are in danger of falling out of reach of the surprising New England Patriots.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/liver-disease-masld-obesity-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-05:00","title":"A surprisingly common liver disease affects millions in the US.

What to know, according to a doctor \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A health condition many people have never heard of has become one of the most common liver diseases in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, often develops quietly, so many people do not realize they have it until it is more advanced and signs show up in blood tests or ultrasounds. Even then, the disease can be hard to detect.\n \n\n   \n  What  is MASLD, and why is it becoming so common? How is it diagnosed if most  people do not notice the symptoms? Who is most at risk? Can the  condition be slowed or reversed, and what treatments exist? And what  steps can people take now to protect their liver health?\n \n\n   \n  To  guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr.  Leana Wen. She is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor  at George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s  health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, or   MASLD, and why is it becoming so common? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  MASLD happens when too much fat builds up in the liver of people who often have underlying metabolic problems, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is not caused by heavy alcohol use. In the past, MASLD was called  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , and people may still hear of the condition being referred to by this name or its abbreviation, NAFLD.\n \n\n   \n  Experts now consider MASLD to be the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. It affects 30% to 40% of the adult population globally, including approximately 60% to 70% of people with type 2 diabetes and 70% to 80% of people with obesity, and roughly 1 in 3 adults in the United States, according to a  recent review in JAMA . As rates of obesity and diabetes have risen, MASLD has increased along with them.\n \n\n   \n  Most people with MASLD will not see their illness progress to severe liver disease, but a significant proportion will develop inflammation, scarring, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer over many years. The condition has already become a leading reason for liver transplantation in certain populations groups.  Moreover, this disease is closely associated with other consequences of diabetes and obesity, such as heart disease, stroke and certain cancers, so MASLD is a signal that the whole body is under metabolic strain, not just the liver.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Are there specific symptoms people should watch for? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Most people with MASLD have no symptoms in the early stages, which is why it often goes undiagnosed. Some may feel more tired than usual or notice vague discomfort or a feeling of fullness on the upper right side of the abdomen, but these signs are nonspecific and easy to overlook.\n \n\n   \n  As  liver damage progresses to more advanced scarring or liver failure,  symptoms become more obvious. They can include yellowing of the skin or  eyes, dark urine, swelling in the legs or abdomen, easy bruising,  confusion or severe fatigue. At that point, the liver disease is already  advanced, which is why it’s important to diagnose the condition long  before these symptoms appear.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How is MASLD diagnosed if most people do not notice symptoms?  \n \n\n   \n   Wen :  In many cases, doctors first suspect MASLD when routine blood tests  show mildly abnormal liver enzymes or when an imaging study done for  another reason, such as an abdominal ultrasound, shows that the liver  looks “fatty.” Because most people don’t have symptoms, the diagnosis  depends on health care providers putting together these clues and  checking for metabolic risk factors — namely excess weight, diabetes or  prediabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n \n\n   \n  Once  physicians identify fat in the liver and rule out other causes, such as  viral hepatitis or heavy alcohol use, they check for any liver damage  or scarring. They may order specialized imaging, and in certain  circumstances, a liver biopsy may be performed. One of the key messages  from the JAMA article is that primary care clinicians caring for people  with metabolic risk factors should be thinking about liver health and  consider screening with noninvasive tools, rather than waiting until  symptoms develop.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Who is most at risk for MASLD? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  It’s  most often seen in adults who have metabolic risk factors. While  obesity is a major risk factor, the condition doesn’t only affect people  who appear overweight. Smaller “metabolically unhealthy” individuals  also can develop MASLD.\n \n\n   \n  Older  age is another risk factor, with incidence higher among those 50 and  above, though the condition also can affect children: Close to 10% of  children ages 2 to 19 have MASLD, according to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, the condition is most prevalent among Hispanic people, followed by non-Hispanic Whites and Asian Americans and less common among non-Hispanic Black individuals, the federal agency notes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Can MASLD be slowed or reversed, and what treatments exist? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The good news is that in many people, MASLD can be improved or even reversed, especially if it is caught early.\n \n\n   \n  Weight  loss is the cornerstone of treatment and can significantly reduce liver  fat and inflammation. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking  most days of the week, also helps improve insulin sensitivity and reduce  liver fat.\n \n\n   \n  Until recently, there were no medications specifically approved for MASLD. That is beginning to change. The US Food and Drug Administration has  approved two drugs  for MASH (metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis), the more advanced form of MASLD that includes liver inflammation and scarring. These two medicines, Rezdiffra (resmetirom) and Wegovy (semaglutide), are meant to be used along with, not instead of, lifestyle changes. There is still no drug that can fully “cure” MASLD, so diagnosing early and preventing progression remain crucial.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What steps can people take now to protect their liver health? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  For  most people, protecting the liver from MASLD is the same as protecting  overall metabolic health. Maintaining or working toward a healthy  weight, being physically active, and eating a  healthy diet  with lean proteins, whole grains and vegetables, as well as one that is low in  added sugars  and  ultraprocessed foods , all help.\n \n\n   \n  If you have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol, it is important to work with your clinician to control these conditions. Ask specifically whether your liver health has been checked. Simple blood tests can identify people who might benefit from further evaluation. And consider  other steps  to improve liver health, including avoiding excessive alcohol intake and staying up-to-date on hepatitis vaccines that protect the liver.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/entertainment/charli-xcx-brat-movie","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:26:00-05:00","title":"Is Charli XCX’s 'The Moment' a mockumentary or what?","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Charli XCX is set to star in a fictional film titled 'The Moment', which explores the aftermath of the success of her 2024 album 'Brat'.

Charli XCX sees your Brat Summer and raises you.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because the pop star is betting she can extend that run with a forthcoming film conceived by and starring her.\n \n\n   \n  A teaser trailer has dropped for “The Moment,” an A24 movie  which Vanity Fair described  as “a revisionist history focused on the aftermath of ‘Brat’s’ release in which she stars with Alexander Skarsgård.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s wild and chaotic — and shows off the singer’s comedic chops, as well as a blink and you miss it glimpse of Kylie Jenner, who makes an appearance.\n \n\n   \n  Charli XCX told Vanity Fair it’s a “2024 period piece.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way, but the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make one,” the singer said. “It’s fiction, but it’s the realest depiction of the music industry that I’ve ever seen.”\n \n\n   \n  Written by Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes and directed by Zamari, it all began in 2024 when Charli XCX was in the middle of co-headlining the “Sweat” tour with fellow singer Troye Sivan and right before she launched her “Brat” tour.\n \n\n   \n  She sent a note to Zamari, who had directed her “Guess” and “360” videos, which he described as “word vomit.”\n \n\n   \n  “It almost felt like a diary entry of, ‘This is how I feel right now,’” Zamiri said. “This feeling of

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:33 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Whenever Donald Trump is in political trouble, he seeks a fight and a foil.\n \n\n   \n  He will get both on Friday after one of the most misjudged weeks of his two presidencies, after his own choices eroded his political authority over  the Jeffrey Epstein scandal .\n \n\n   \n  Trump is embroiled in a  bitter new feud with Democrats  over national security, provocative rhetoric and presidential power that he  deliberately turned nuclear . And at a White House meeting Friday, he’ll go head-to-head with the next mayor of New York,  Zohran Mamdani , a democratic socialist he’s planning to brand as the unacceptable “communist” face of the Democratic Party next year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political touch deserted him in recent days. He’s heard speculation about whether his decadelong grip on the GOP base is slipping. His missteps amplified the big question over Epstein — why is he so desperate to stop the evidence coming out? And his attempt to empathize with voters over the cost of living  became a farce  when he accused Democrats of stealing the world “affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  So you just knew the president, who has gotten  more irascible by the day , would look for an opening.\n \n\n   \n  And he found it, taking the chance to ignite the kind of political storm that obliterates everything in its path, drags his outraged foes onto his preferred political ground, rallies conservative media and solidifies his base.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tried to seize back the initiative — in the inflammatory way that only he can — in a post of social media posts and reposts that culminated by a warning that a group of Democratic lawmakers were guilty of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  His fury was provoked by a video from lawmakers who — unlike the commander in chief — were veterans of the military or intelligence services reminding members of the armed services that they  do not have to obey any illegal orders .\n \n\n   \n    ‘Never in a million years …’\n \n\n   \n  By any objective measure, Trump’s response was inflammatory and disproportionate in the country’s current climate of political violence. After all, this was a president of the United States ostensibly calling for the prosecution and possible execution of members of Congress. That’s not just an affront to decency and presidential decorum; it’s an assault on the foundations of constitutional, republican government and the separation of powers.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s dangerous. Republicans accused Democrats of inciting violence after two assassination attempts against Trump and the killing of conservative icon Charlie Kirk. It’s hard to see how this is any different. The president’s comments also contrasted with the conciliatory tone of one of his erstwhile political friends, MAGA icon  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia , who apologized Sunday on CNN for her role in “toxic politics.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the Democrats who appears in the video expressed her shock.\n \n\n   \n  “I never in a million years, thought I’d be talking to you tonight about the fact that the president of the United States has called for my death by hanging for sedition and treason. And called for it because I and a number of other people published a video that says you have to follow the law,” Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, loves these kinds of fights.\n \n\n   \n  By any normal political standards, they’d be potential career enders for a top political figure. But Trump uses them, as he did Thursday, to get Democrats to make arguments in defense of institutions, the Constitution, civility and traditional presidential behavior. Their points are often well made. But they can often seem esoteric and off-topic to voters far from Washington who are more concerned with economic security or the cost of health care. In recent elections, Democratic warnings about Trump fracturing norms and legal constraints and threatening the “soul” of the nation haven’t always worked.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the controversies whip up Trump’s conservative media cheerleaders and activists and sets up a loyalty test for Republicans wary of breaking with him.\n \n\n   \n  The country has seen it all before, multiple times: In Trump’s racist “birther” campaign against President Barack Obama; in his mockery of the late Sen. John McCain’s war record; in his false claims that he won the 2020 election. It’s a technique that has often worked for Trump. He might alienate half the country, but it’s one of the keys to his staunch support from his GOP base and his capacity to always portray himself as an anti-establishment scourge and an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  One question now, however, amid some of his worst-ever approval ratings and struggles with the economy, is whether Trump’s antics may begin to disgust even some voters who have always stood by him.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans face familiar political dodgeball\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s bombshell was typical of the distraction tactics that Trump has always used and that some of his critics have sometimes accused the news media of repeatedly falling for. Yet Trump’s “distraction” gambits are often so unhinged or threatening to basic American values that it’s inevitable that they create huge shock and fierce debate. They require pushback from his opponents, even if it dilutes their messages.\n \n\n   \n  As usual, Trump’s detonation of a new controversy forced Republicans on Capitol Hill to dance on the head of a political pin, with some deploying the classic excuse that they hadn’t read the posts.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson gingerly tried to separate himself from the president’s comments, saying the words “are not the ones that I would use.” He told CNN’s Manu Raju that “obviously, I don’t think that this is… these are crimes punishable by death or any of that.”\n \n\n   \n  Another close Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said the president’s comments were “over the top.” And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has questioned the legality of administration attacks on alleged drug-trafficker boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, said he didn’t think it was a “good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked whether the president really wanted the execution of members of Congress. She replied: “No.” But true to Trump’s lifetime mantra, she counterattacked, sketching an argument other Republicans adopted that the video was an attempt to get members of the armed forces to disobey the commander in chief.\n \n\n   \n  This is a misrepresentation. But it created sufficient political heat to blur reality while making the president’s out-of-bounds outburst seem just like one side of a political back-and-forth. Johnson, for instance, said that what the legislators did was “unprecedented in American history, and it should be called out, and that’s what the president has expressed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some might question why the Democrats chose to make their video — and to give the president an opportunity to change the subject after he’s spent days flailing over the Epstein matter and the cost of living. And any political move involving the military risks creating a drama that leaves servicemembers in the middle of a partisan firestorm.\n \n\n   \n  A counterargument would be that there is deep concern among many lawmakers — one that is especially acute for combat veterans — that Trump will ask service members to undertake unlawful attacks and missions. This is not hypothetical.  As CNN’s Aaron Blake reported , there have been many occasions when Trump’s foreign policy or military ventures have raised questions of legality.\n \n\n   \n  Judges have often ruled that administration policies infringed the law. Trump has sent troops into American cities on questionable grounds. His actions near Venezuela have many on Capitol Hill fearing an illegal war. And his threats of retribution need to be taken seriously since he’s turned the Justice Department into his engine of personal retribution.\n \n\n   \n  And after all, the Democrats in the video were only restating a principle that every servicemember understands — even if the question of deciding whether an order is a legal or not can be fraught and imprecise during the fog of war.\n \n\n   \n    High-stakes White House showdown looms\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s meeting with Mamdani at the White House on Friday is high stakes for both men.\n \n\n   \n  Both are New Yorkers; both won power through populist politics. Each harnessed a political moment and won power against insider, establishment elites.\n \n\n   \n  But while presidential power dwarfs that of a mere mayor-to-be, some comparisons may also be unflattering to Trump, who at 79 is closer to the end of his political career than the 34-year-old Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made his intentions clear with Mamdani. He’s setting up the mayor-elect as a political foil and a symbol of all Democrats to try to dispute their party’s more mainstream credentials ahead of the midterm elections next year. “Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting,” Trump said on his Truth Social network on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The president threatened during the mayoral campaign to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won because “as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Mamdani is not a communist, and anyone who understands the deprivations and tyranny of communist rule in the Soviet Union and elsewhere would see the comparison as absurd. But he’s been  enthusiastic in his democratic socialism , and Trump will be hoping that his attacks can brand the incoming mayor and his followers nationwide as extreme.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting, if it takes place in the Oval Office, before the cameras, will be a huge test for Mamdani. The president has not hesitated to humiliate some past visitors on television,  most notoriously Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . But Mamdani will also know that some of the president’s ire can sometimes be defused by flattery.\n \n\n   \n  The next mayor of New York City will be keen to show he can stand up to Trump — and to maneuver politically ahead of what could be a year of confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  And any new eruptions by the president, after a week in which he’s looked like he’s racing off the rails, might only further underscore doubts over his political health.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/medicare-premiums-rise-health-care","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:45:00-05:00","title":"Senior Citizens Will Pay a Lot More for Medicare in 2026","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senior citizens will face a sharp increase in Medicare Part B premiums in 2026, rising nearly 10% to $202.90—making it the largest increase in four years and second-largest in history.

By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:45 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senior citizens are the latest group of Americans to face steep increases in their health insurance premiums for 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Part B premiums will jump nearly 10% next year, the largest increase in  four years  and second-largest hike, in dollar terms, in the program’s history. The standard monthly premium will be $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from this year, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That will eat up nearly one-third of the $56 monthly  Social Security cost-of-living adjustment  that retirees will receive in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The steep increase in premiums for Medicare Part B — which covers doctors’ visits, outpatient hospital services, medical equipment and drugs administered by physicians, among other services — comes at a time when health insurance premiums are rising sharply for those with  job-based coverage  and  Affordable Care Act policies.  This upward trend puts more pressure on Americans already struggling with affordability as the prices of  food ,  utilities  and other necessities remain stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “In a world in which people are concerned about the affordability of health care and all other needs, it’s pretty distressing that this increase is so large,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at The Century Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Increasing medical and pharmaceutical costs, as well as usage, are common drivers of the rise in health care premiums across coverage types.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare is also contending with the continuing wave of baby boomers becoming eligible to enroll, plus the ongoing shift toward surgeries and other medical services being performed at outpatient facilities, rather than in hospitals, where care is covered by Medicare Part A, said Rachel Schmidt, research professor at Georgetown University’s Medicare Policy Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  CMS noted that monthly premiums would have risen by another $11 had it not approved a change in payment for skin substitutes that the agency says will reduce spending by nearly 90% on the wound care products. Medicare shelled out more than $10 billion for these products last year, up from $256 million in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Medicare Part D prescription drug policies, which are offered by insurers, will see fewer changes for 2026 than they did for this year. The Biden administration had to rush last fall to stand up a  multibillion-dollar subsidy program  for insurers to prevent steep premium increases stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act. The law, which the Democrat-led Congress approved in 2022, required insurers to be on the hook for more of the drug costs once enrollees hit the catastrophic coverage phase above  a $2,000 cap .\n \n\n   \n  The number of plans being offered for 2026 will decrease modestly, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which noted that Elevance is exiting the market. Many insurers are hiking their premiums by as much as $50 for next year, though some are lowering them or holding them steady.\n \n\n   \n  “If seniors in the standalone PDP market are willing to shop, there is still stability,” said Brooks Conway, a principal at Oliver Wyman.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 69 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, which also covers people with disabilities. The annual open enrollment period ends December 7.\n \n\n   \n    Medicare Advantage market retrenches\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Advantage, which covers just over half of Medicare beneficiaries, is going through a second year of  major changes . The overhaul is being spurred by medical costs outpacing reimbursements from the federal government, which pays insurers to offer coverage to Medicare enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  Many enrollees will have to search for new coverage for 2026 since the number of offerings is tumbling 10% to 3,373 plans, according to Oliver Wyman. Major insurers, including CVS Aetna, Elevance, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, are reducing their plan options in at least 100 counties. The changes are expected to affect just over 2 million people.\n \n\n   \n  (These figures do not include special needs plans that cater to enrollees with chronic conditions or those who are dually eligible for Medicaid. These plans will have more offerings for 2026 than they did this year.)\n \n\n   \n  In certain counties, there will be fewer policies offered with $0 premiums and fewer PPO plans, which have wider provider networks, said Greg Berger, a partner at Oliver Wyman. Insurers are primarily seeking to exit or scale back their less profitable products and geographic areas.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of MAPD plans are trying not to grow,” Berger said, referring to Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage.\n \n\n   \n  And for the first time, some Americans will have no Medicare Advantage plans to choose from. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont and UnitedHealthcare decided to discontinue their coverage in the Green Mountain State, leaving traditional Medicare as the only option for residents in eight counties.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even with the pullbacks, most Medicare beneficiaries will have an array of options in 2026 — 39 plans, on average, down from 42 plans this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to a broad range of affordable coverage options in 2026,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, CMS’ administrator, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Also, fewer plans will offer $0 deductibles for prescription drugs, while maximum out-of-pocket limits for medical care are rising $490, or about 10%, on average. Among Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage that have a monthly premium, the average premium will increase to $66 next year, up from $60 this year.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the supplemental benefits that Medicare Advantage offers enrollees, such as funds for over-the-counter medicines, dental care and vision services, are getting skimpier.

November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescuers were still working through the rubble on Friday, uncovering more bodies after a Russian attack hit apartment buildings in western Ukraine earlier this week, killing at least 31 people including several children, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s emergency service said Thursday that people were still missing after the airstrikes on two apartment blocks in the western city of Ternopil. On Friday, three more bodies were recovered, including those of two children. Ukraine’s interior minister said the strikes may have wiped out entire families.\n \n\n   \n  The large-scale Russian attack overnight Tuesday was one of the deadliest to target western Ukraine since the start of the conflict and prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets over neighboring Poland and Romania.\n \n\n   \n  Russia “will never stop on its own,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram, urging allies to increase pressure on Moscow to halt the violence and restore peace.\n \n\n   \n  Oksana Kobel’s son was in a ninth-story apartment in the building at the time of the attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to work, heard the explosions. I called him and said, ‘Bohdan, go to the shelter, get dressed.’ He answered, ‘Mom, I am already up. Everything will be fine,’” she said   Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s attacks have mostly targeted the eastern part of the country and large cities such as Kyiv, and many Ukrainians have fled to the west.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles during the attack. The buildings in Ternopil were most likely hit by Russia’s powerful Kh-101 cruise missile, which is designed to avoid air defenses and is equipped with an advanced precision guiding system, they said.   \n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Defense Ministry said it scrambled two Eurofighters, part of NATO’s fleet, and later two Romanian F-16 fighter jets after a  Russian drone entered its airspace  during the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Polish and allied fighter jets were also launched to protect Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, the country’s  operational command  said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation were in Ukraine on Thursday for meetings with officials following reports that Russia and the US were working on peace proposals that call for Ukraine to cede land and reduce the size of its army.\n \n\n   \n  Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski told CNN that any peace plan would have to involve Europe and leave Ukraine with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Poland is a neighbor of both Russia and Ukraine, and the (European Union) is helping Ukraine more, including militarily, than the US, and also financially more than the US. So we have a much bigger stake in this than the US,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  NATO allies have  increasingly scrambled fighter jets  in recent months during Russian attacks on Ukraine, or when stray Russian munitions, drones and warplanes have either strayed too close to their borders or crossed them.\n \n\n   \n  The latest move by NATO comes during a tense week. Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Poland’s Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed regret over the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the US State Department approved a possible $105 million sale that would allow Ukraine to upgrade its Patriot air defense system – a critical shield against Russian aerial attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s ability to meet current and future threats by further equipping it to conduct self-defense and regional security missions with a more robust local sustainment capability,” said a Pentagon statement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Zelensky struck a deal during a visit to Paris to purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/style/wicked-for-good-costume-design-paul-tazewell","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:10:00-05:00","title":"A witch in trousers?

Weird \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In popular culture, the archetypal look of a witch is a female figure generally depicted wearing a black dress, robe, or cloak. Typically, she also sports a pointed hat and carries a broomstick that doubles as her mode of transport. It’s an image that was largely solidified by the 1939 film “The Wizard of Oz,” featuring the Wicked Witch of the West, despite a belief in witches and witchcraft that has long existed in many cultures worldwide for centuries.\n \n\n   \n  As “Wicked: For Good,” the sequel to the modern film adaptation directed by Jon M. Chu, releases in cinemas, eagle-eyed viewers may notice a subtle difference in the witchy protagonist, Elphaba, played by Cynthia Erivo. Devotees, fear not: She still has green skin and an all-encompassing uniform of black. However, for the first time, the character wears trousers. Slim fit and very discrete, they’re worn by Elphaba as she appears in the opening scene, swooping down from the sky to thwart the plight of animals, and throughout the film, as she’s on the run from a mob of angry townspeople on a witch hunt.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a style choice, a thematic one,” according to Paul Tazewell, the costume designer for both “Wicked” (for which he  won an Oscar this year ) and “Wicked: For Good.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from his home in Brooklyn, New York, Tazewell — who worked on the costumes for both films simultaneously — recounts Elphaba’s outfits in the first, from the black pinafore she wears as a little girl when she mourns the death of her mother, to the long, tailored coatdress with puffed sleeves seen on her arrival at Shiz University as a reserved young woman. Her whole life, “she’s othered because of the color of her skin,” said Tazewell. “She’s an oddity within the community.” That kind of prejudice is enough to make any introvert become more reticent. Yet, Elphaba doesn’t — a retaliation that is expressed through her clothes, which she “protects and armors” herself with, he added.\n \n\n   \n  As the first film ends, Elphaba is seen parting ways with Glinda, the benevolent good witch played by Ariana Grande, and the decision to introduce trousers was made as her new environment required her to be more agile. “She’s in exile in the forest, so she only has access to certain things. Her dress is in tatters at this point,” said Tazewell. “We moved away from a dress silhouette to one where she can be active and also give more presence.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, while trousers allow Elphaba to move more freely, it is also indicative of her newfound liberation. “It really is about self-expression,” Tazewell continued. “Elphaba has decided that she sees herself as the most important thing, and finding and having a connection to that self-love is her drive. It’s where her power lies.”\n \n\n   \n    A marker of independence\n \n\n   \n  Modern depictions of witches in pop culture range from Roald Dahl’s 1983 book of the same name, which portrayed witches as gruesome creatures without hair or fingernails, to more glamorous or gothic interpretations seen via Maleficent of “Sleeping Beauty” and  the witches of “Suspiria.”  Others, such as “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” Hermione Granger in “Harry Potter,” the sisters in “Charmed,” and Bonnie in “The Vampire Diaries,” appear entirely normal, taking on the guise of an ordinary girl next door.\n \n\n   \n  But Elphaba is different in that she is neither ghastly nor glam. Her impact is more figurative, as she serves as a symbol of empowerment, primarily through her unwavering moral conviction and courage to defy unjust societal expectations. For some experts, there are parallels that can be drawn between Elphaba’s liberation in the new film and the kind women experienced in the mid-19th century when they started entering traditionally male-dominated spaces like the workplace and began wearing trousers more publicly.\n \n\n   \n  One of the earliest iterations were floaty, wide-legged shorts known as “bloomers” — popularized by the early suffragist Amelia Bloomer, they were worn as undergarments and allowed for greater comfort and freedom of movement. The garment’s rise coincided with the adoption of once strictly male activities like riding a bicycle. But, despite its benefits, it “quickly drew ridicule because people thought it was so shocking and distracting from the cause,” said April C. Armstrong, who co-curated a recent exhibition at Princeton University contextualizing  women’s fashion in the 19th and 20th centuries . Bloomers have since become fashionable and are no longer treated as underwear, as seen on  the high fashion runways  and worn by celebrities like  the pop star Dua Lipa .\n \n\n   \n  However, women did not universally start wearing trousers until the 20th century, when Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel started popularizing them in her collections (the designer liked wearing pants herself and  often borrowed them from her male lovers ). Silver screen stars including Katherine Hepburn, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich, who all wore trousers, helped to create its association with a “modern, independent and spirited” woman, said Rhonda Garelick, the founding director of Hofstra’s Institute for Public Humanities and the Arts. “In trousers, women can not only ride a bicycle, but they can play sports; they can walk more quickly; they can get in and out of vehicles,” continued Garelick. “We tend to forget it was much more difficult for women, and to this day, I think a woman wearing trousers is still associated with independence.”\n \n\n   \n    More than meets the eye\n \n\n   \n  When it came to creating the looks for “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good,” Tazewell — whose historic win of the Academy Award’s best costume design made him the first Black man to take home the prize — placed great emphasis on ensuring harmony between the central characters, especially when Elphaba had a greater risk of being overshadowed by Glinda’s more colorful, frothy gowns. And while black is a color that typically struggles to jump off the screen, Elphaba never disappears into the background.\n \n\n   \n  This can be credited to Tazewell’s choice of sumptuous textures and rich fabrics. “When something is light and pink and what we call pretty, it is easier to make that look elevated and glamorous, but with black, elements can get lost,” he said. “What I was relying on is the depth that was created, whether it was in the micro-pleating that created an undulating pattern on her Emerald City dress, or her sweeping trench coat, which is made of a wax cotton that is water repellent” — a significant detail given the belief among the film’s townsfolk that water makes Elphaba melt.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematography was also an important consideration, he added, as “light reflects different textures in different ways.” He explained: “If it’s wool and felted, it will soak in. If it’s pleated, then we catch the depth of the pleats in the way it’s lit. In both films, we used an underlayer of color underneath Elphaba’s sheer black to give a more iridescent quality.”\n \n\n   \n  But, as is typical of Tazewell’s work, there’s always greater meaning beyond the aesthetic. In “Wicked: For Good,” not only has Elphaba adopted trousers as part of her silhouette, but she has “a swaggering presence because she has knee high boots with a slightly higher heel. The brim of her hat becomes a little more extreme,” said Tazewell — symbolizing a refusal to adhere to societal rules and expectations. Elphaba may be ostracized, but that won’t stop her from commanding attention and taking up space. Unlike Glinda, whose delicate dresses nipped in the waist, feel like the opposite of that, as she seeks to maintain her idealized image.\n \n\n   \n  For Tazewell, those nuances are key. “The spark point for me really was when Cynthia was cast as Elphaba,” he said. “It’s fueled by the fact that we have a Black woman playing a role about a woman who is vilified for the color of her skin, and the choices she makes to empower herself, to go towards what she feels is right and true. That speaks of humanity and how we relate to each other.” It may be why the story, which began as a book before being turned into a hit Broadway musical and film, has resonated with so many audiences, he said. “‘Wicked’ is unlike any other American tale that we have. It operates as an allegory for the modern systems that we have — around power, around self-evolution, and also around advocation for animals and the environment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/transgender-cancer-registries-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-05:00","title":"US cancer registries, constrained by Trump policies, to recognize only ‘male’ or ‘female’ patients","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. cancer registries, which collect vital data on cancer incidence and survival across the country, are being required to classify patients’ sex as only male, female, or unknown due to policies from the Trump administration.

only ‘male’ or ‘female’ patients \n       \n  By Rachana Pradhan, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.\n \n\n   \n  The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute  will categorize cancer patients  as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.\n \n\n   \n  Registries  currently specify  whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump in January issued an  executive order  stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.\n \n\n   \n  “In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.\n \n\n   \n    Missing the big picture\n \n\n   \n  Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n  For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents  97% of the U.S. population . The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering  nearly half  the U.S. population.\n \n\n   \n  The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.\n \n\n   \n  For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying  rising rates of colorectal cancer  among people  younger than 50 . As a result, U.S. guidelines  now recommend  that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.\n \n\n   \n  States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women.  The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas  initiated a statewide effort  aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”\n \n\n   \n  The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.\n \n\n   \n  For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.\n \n\n   \n  The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Backwards’ progress\n \n\n   \n  NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.\n \n\n   \n  According to an  analysis of CDC data  by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.\n \n\n   \n  “Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.\n \n\n   \n  A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were  two to three times  as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.\n \n\n   \n  A  Canadian study  concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a  2023 study  from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.\n \n\n   \n  Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.\n \n\n   \n  Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and  stopping specialized services  for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.\n \n\n   \n  Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”\n \n\n   \n   KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at  KFF  — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/eric-swalwell-california-governor-race-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:42:00-05:00","title":"Democratic Rep.

That’s ruffled feathers in India \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, Matthew Rehbein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:39 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When JD Vance told a stadium of thousands he hoped his wife would one day be moved “by the Christian gospel” the same way he was, he inadvertently stepped into a contentious dialogue in India and among the diaspora about religious freedom and, for some, evoked memories of the country’s complicated past with Christian proselytizing.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at an event last month with Turning Point USA at the University of Mississippi, Vance was asked by an audience member about Christianity and American patriotism.\n \n\n   \n  “Why are we making Christianity one of the major things that you have to have in common to be one of you guys? To show that I love America just as much as you do?” the audience member asked.\n \n\n   \n  In an assertive and lengthy response that began on immigration, Vance then discussed his interfaith marriage: “My wife did not grow up Christian. I think it’s fair to say she grew up in a Hindu family but not in a particularly religious family.”\n \n\n   \n  Raised in an evangelical family, Vance converted  to Catholicism in 2019.  His wife,  Usha Vance , who grew up in Southern California and is of Indian descent, was raised in a Hindu household.\n \n\n   \n  “Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church? I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,” Vance went on to say.\n \n\n   \n  As the debate around those comments began to swell online among some Indians and the Indian diaspora, Vance responded to a since-deleted comment  on X , writing that “like many people in an interfaith marriage,” he hopes his wife may see things as he does one day, but would continue to support her regardless.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on October 30 at the Turning Point USA event honoring his longtime friend and late conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, Vance explained that he and his wife were “agnostic or atheist” when they met.\n \n\n   \n  “We decided to raise our kids Christian,” the vice president said, adding that the couple’s 8-year-old son, Vivek, had his first communion a year ago –– a remark that drew thunderous applause.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance talked about navigating raising children in an interfaith marriage during an  interview  with Meghan McCain in June, noting she and her husband had several conversations about it during his conversion to Catholicism.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not Catholic and I’m not intending to convert or anything like that,” Usha Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that while their children attend Catholic school, “they can choose whether they want to be baptized Catholic.” They are also exposed to the Hindu faith and traditions through her family, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My grandmother is a particularly devout Hindu. She prays every day. She goes to the temple regularly. She’ll do her own pujas (prayer rituals).”\n \n\n   \n  During the event last month, the vice president said, “One of the most important Christian principles is that you respect free will … You figure this stuff out as a family, and you trust in God to have a plan, and you try to follow it as best as you can.”\n \n\n   \n  But, despite Vance’s invocation of free will, his remarks struck a nerve –– some described the vice president’s words as denigrating towards Hindus –– and broadly, South Asians –– at a time of rising hostilities towards immigrants in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ridiculous and absolutely wrong,” 25-year-old Kush Mehta of Mumbai told CNN of Vance’s comments expressing his hope his wife would convert. “I’m in favor of everyone having their own identity, their own values, and their own spiritual path. No one should be forced or pressured into any religion.”\n \n\n   \n  “Vance felt compelled to declare that his wife was indeed raised Hindu, but not that Hindu,” CNN affiliate CNN-News18 editor Shubhangi Sharma wrote in an  opinion column . “In a political climate so charged against Indian immigrants, this is not just personal. It’s political. It’s a presidential call to convert.”\n \n\n   \n  “When an elected leader treats his faith as the ultimate ideal for everyone, including his wife, it ceases to be personal,” Areena Arora, a journalist with  The Hindu , wrote in an opinion piece, noting at the time of his baptism six years ago, Vance told  The American Conservative : “My views on public policy and what the optimal state should look like are pretty aligned with Catholic social teaching.”\n \n\n   \n    A reminder of India’s colonial past\n \n\n   \n  For some, Vance’s comments were a reminder of India’s painful past, where the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century heralded Christian proselytization, prejudice and, at times, forced conversions - particularly under British colonial rule.\n \n\n   \n  “The belief that the Christian religion must shape public order is the same civilisational justification that fuelled Europe’s conquest of the world,” Arora, a journalist with The Hindu, wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the differences between how Hindus and Christians think of religion, and because of the colonial history of Christian evangelizing, many Hindus today still think of Christianity as a kind of undigestible ‘foreign faith,’” said Chad Bauman, a professor of religious studies at Butler University in Indiana whose research focuses on the interactions and conflicts between Hindus and Christians.\n \n\n   \n  “This view is particularly common among the supporters of the party currently in charge,” Bauman added, referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its brand of Hindu Nationalism.\n \n\n   \n  India has seen recurring ethnic and religious clashes for centuries – but tensions have surged in recent decades amid a rise in violence against the Christian and Muslim minorities and, most notably, since the BJP came to power in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  India’s constitution guarantees freedom of religion, although some critics argue that religious freedoms have been eroded under the BJP at the expense of non-Hindu minorities. The issue of changing religion remains deeply controversial, and multiple states have put in place laws restricting religious conversions for all faiths.\n \n\n   \n  Bauman said Vance’s remarks also confirmed a common stereotype many Hindus have of religion in Trump’s America: “America is not a nation of religious tolerance and pluralism but rather one that privileges Christianity over all other religions.”\n \n\n   \n  Several social media users described Vance’s comments as contrary to American values.\n \n\n   \n  One  X  user criticized Vance for what they viewed as him casting Usha’s Hindu faith as a “problem to be fixed,” writing: “This isn’t American values; it’s weak leadership & poor politics, bending to MAGA pressure, not defending her dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  Another user wrote on  X : “When JD Vance had hit his lowest, it was his ‘Hindu’ wife and her Hindu upbringing that had helped him navigate through the tough times. Today in a position of power, her religion has become a liability. What a fall.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘She has to stick to her roots’\n \n\n   \n  For some in India, Usha Vance’s position in the administration as a woman of Hindu faith has become a point of pride.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s amazing … to see someone with Indian roots and a Hindu background in such a visible, powerful space in the US. It shows how far the community has come and how diverse leadership is becoming,” said Mehta of Mumbai.\n \n\n   \n  If the second lady does convert, “It would create a lot of backlash from people who are very staunch in their beliefs,” said Vanessa Almeida, a business owner in Goa.\n \n\n   \n  “She has to stick to her roots as much as possible,” Almeida said. “That’s what the community has been hoping for.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the vice president and second lady’s offices.\n \n\n   \n  Vance was quick to defend himself on social media against backlash, writing in the  X post  that the criticism wreaked “of anti-Christian bigotry.”\n \n\n   \n  “She is not Christian and has no plans to convert,” Vance clarified, adding that Usha Vance encouraged him to “reengage” with his faith many years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “But like many people in an interfaith marriage –– or any interfaith relationship –– I hope she may one day see things as I do,” he goes on to say. “Regardless, I’ll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she’s my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is completely in contrast to Vance’s previous comments that his wife’s Hindu upbringing and values inspired his own return to faith,” Priyanka Deo, US correspondent of Indian network NDTV, said on  Instagram , adding that his latest remarks suggest acceptance in the United States is conditional and predicated upon becoming a Christian.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, who converted to Catholicism while already married, has said his wife encouraged him to explore his faith and that his family influenced him in the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember when I started to reengage with my own faith, Usha was very supportive,” Vance said during an interview with  Fox News  in June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  During the same interview, Usha Vance said she supported her husband’s decision for a few reasons, including seeing the power of her parents’ faith. “That was one of the things that made them such good parents. That made them, really, very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  “I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Wooing the Republican base?\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s comments come ahead of the 2028 election. Trump, in August, suggested Vance was “most likely” the heir apparent to the  Make America Great Again movement  –– the furthest he’s gone in backing Vance as a future presidential candidate.\n \n\n   \n  Vance also told Fox News recently he plans to talk to Trump about potentially running after the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Ram Puniyani, a Mumbai-based writer and critic of Hindu fundamentalism, said he thinks Vance’s comments trample on freedom of religion –– an essential tenant of any democratic society, be it the United States or India, which is still widely regarded as the world’s largest democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that America’s civic society had much more liberal attitudes earlier, but those attitudes are getting rigid, and this is not a healthy thing for the growth of democracy worldwide,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance has not spoken out about her husband’s comments, though some have jumped quickly to her defense.\n \n\n   \n  “No one has been harsher on JD Vance’s policy than I have,” wrote California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who is also Hindu,  on X.  “But his wife is an accomplished daughter of immigrants, and they have young kids. Attack on the policies. Leave his family out of it.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to others who have called Usha Vance a threat to the “MAGA base,” McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, said the second lady was a “huge asset” to the Republican party, someone who bridged party and political lines and “brought warmth” to the vice president.\n \n\n   \n  “She is among other things a modern mother and a style icon,”  McCain wrote on X . “She’s personally my favorite person in the Trump administration.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/discharge-petitions-congress-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"The success of the forced Epstein files vote is emboldening some Republicans to go it alone","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The success of a House Republican-led vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files has emboldened members like Anna Paulina Luna to challenge House leadership by using discharge petitions to push legislation independently.

files vote is emboldening some Republicans to go it alone \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson may want to put the Jeffrey Epstein saga behind him, but some Republicans saw rank-and-file members’ success in forcing Tuesday’s vote as an opportunity to push their own legislative priorities to the floor — even if it doesn’t have leadership’s blessing.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has put House Republican leaders on notice that unless they change their approach to a bipartisan bill banning lawmaker stock trading, she will circumvent them using a discharge petition and force a vote herself.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent interview in her office, the Florida Republican told CNN the overwhelming support from lawmakers to release the Jeffrey Epstein files should encourage more members to take advantage of the leadership-bucking tool that made the vote possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think more members need to use it,” Luna said. “More members need to get outside of this mentality that you have to go and ask for permission from leadership to bring legislation. That’s not why you’re here. And that defeats the purpose of why you call yourself a representative. If you want to be a follower, call yourself a follower of Congress, but not a representative of Congress if you’re not doing your job.”\n \n\n   \n  Typically, the majority party’s leadership team dictates floor activity, setting the calendar for which bills are brought and when.\n \n\n   \n  Discharge petitions face many procedural hurdles (to start, it requires 218 signatures — a majority of all 435 members, rather than a majority of members present) and rarely lead to an actual vote.\n \n\n   \n  It’s even more unusual for a member to deploy the tactic when their own party is in power. But in a fractured Washington with razor-thin margins in the House, there are signs lawmakers may consider the strategy more seriously.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Don Bacon recently signed onto a discharge petition to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers after President Donald Trump  signed  an executive order ending the practice. That petition just clinched the necessary 218 signatures needed to move forward toward a vote on the House floor. And this week, Bacon told CNN he is preparing to help launch another petition that would push for more aid to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I respect the speaker and the majority leader drive the agenda. But the discharge petition process enables us to push member-driven initiatives to the floor for a vote,” Bacon said.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who also signed onto the workers’ rights petition, said “it’s is certainly being viewed by members individuals as a tool in their disposal.” Still, he said, their use is “still very limited and it really depends on the issue.”\n \n\n   \n  This year alone, lawmakers have brought 10 discharge petitions, with the Epstein files push standing as the most notable. Last Congress, under Republican control, 20 discharge petitions were filed, after 18 the Congress before. By contrast in the 116th Congress, from 2019-2020, only 5 such attempts were made. Only a handful became law.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had long tried to block the Epstein discharge petition from coming to the floor and strongly criticized the use of the tool to force a vote, even though he ultimately supported the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Discharge petitions are never a good idea. In the House, it is a tool of the minority party, not the majority,” Johnson said in July.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Acknowledging Johnson’s argument, Luna said, “A discharge petition is simply a legislative tool where we actually can collect signatures to bring something to the floor. It’s kind of an old school way of legislating.”\n \n\n   \n  And the tool has helped her clinch legislative wins. The congresswoman’s threat of bringing a discharge petition helped her  reach an agreement  with Johnson in their standoff over proxy voting for new parents, an issue that had paralyzed the House.\n \n\n   \n  “I will protect the discharge petition with every bone in my body,” Luna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    New push to ban stock trading\n \n\n   \n  Now, Luna is prepared to use the same strategy to ensure the bipartisan push to ban stock trading of lawmakers, their spouses and their dependent children becomes law as pressure has escalated for elected officials to weed out corruption and restore public trust in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long-traded stocks and seeking a ban has been a yearslong pursuit. But Luna says that she is running into new roadblocks that are clouding the process.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of taking up the bipartisan bill that has 95 cosponsors, Luna said she has been informed that leadership wants to pursue their own bill and that members would not be allowed to add their own amendments.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just not feeling that this has been an open and honest process,” Luna said. “And so, I will make that decision collectivity with the other members who signed on.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Luna said that House Speaker Mike Johnson has been understanding throughout this process, but she is giving leadership until Friday to address the issue with her.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, I understand that he also has to manage other people and there’s a lot of personalities,” Luna said of Johnson. “This is not a popular topic on the Hill. In fact, it’s made me very unpopular within the House of Representatives but very popular among the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Even with the Friday deadline, Luna says her discharge petition is ready to go.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s filed, so it means it’s baked, so I can call it up whenever. And that’s the element of surprise that we like to keep people on our toes. So it’s ready to go,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/americas/canadian-man-loses-legal-battle-to-keep-his-secret-million-dollar-stash","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:45:00-05:00","title":"Canadian man loses legal battle to keep his secret million-dollar stash","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Canadian man, Marcel Breton, lost a 16-year legal battle to retain over 1.2 million Canadian dollars he buried in secret locations on his property in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

 \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:45 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Canadian man has lost his 16-year legal battle to get back more than 1.2 million Canadian dollars he had stored in bizarre locations around his home.\n \n\n   \n  On December 1, 2009, police visited Marcel Breton’s rural property on the outskirts of Thunder Bay, a city in northwest Ontario, looking for an illegal handgun,  according to court documents. \n \n\n   \n  There, they made an unusual discovery: 15,000 Canadian dollars’ worth of bills in the floor heating ducts of the living room, about 32,000 dollars stored in locations around the garage, and over 1.2 million worth of Canadian bills in a rubber tub buried in the ground under the garage.\n \n\n   \n  All up, the stash was worth 1.19 million US dollars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  Police also found a variety of drugs, including cocaine, marijuana and ecstasy, and told Canadian media at the time that they were “flabbergasted.”\n \n\n   \n  Breton was charged with various offences, including possession of the proceeds of crime, and was initially convicted. But in a retrial, he successfully argued the search of his property wasn’t lawful, and he was acquitted.\n \n\n   \n  But then came the matter of what to do with all of the money.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, an Ontario appeals court upheld a 2023 ruling that decided the lion’s share of the money should go to the government.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court noted the trial judge, Justice Bruce Fitzpatrick, remarked that it was “unusual for an average person to have such a large amount of money buried in tubs underneath their property.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted that the most common type of bill found in the bundles was 20 Canadian dollars, which is the most common denomination associated with the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, Breton had not reported any income to the Canada Revenue Agency between 2001 and 2008, the documents said.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also did not buy Breton’s justifications for why he had so much cash – that he had won it in a lottery or casino, or had earned it from his vehicle repair business.\n \n\n   \n  The trial judge then ordered that most of the money be handed over to the government, a decision the appeals court affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Sanaa Ahmed, assistant professor of law at the University of Calgary, said the case is an example of “legalistic hair-splitting.”\n \n\n   \n  “Confronted with facts such as these, courts will often find ways to justify confiscating monies and thus ‘punishing’ the accused, even though they may have been acquitted otherwise,” she told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, as societies, we’re growing increasingly comfortable with breaking some rules to catch the so-called ‘bad guys,’” Ahmed added. “But we forget that we made those rules precisely to avoid subjective, normative judgements by those who found themselves in judicial office.”\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Gallant, professor of law at the University of Manitoba, said in this case, the onus is on Breton to prove the money was obtained legally, noting “cash is the currency of illegal drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “What legitimate source might underlie dollars stuffed in a barrel and buried?  Why bury it?  Each day, at the very least, you would even bank interest,” Gallant said.\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t all bad news for Breton. The appeals court upheld Fitzpatrick’s prior ruling that Breton gets to keep 15,000 Canadian dollars which was found inside the vents of the home, since the judge couldn’t rule out that that cash had been obtained lawfully. In today’s money, that’s worth just over $10,600.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/alabama-public-libraries-books-transgender-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:42:00.000Z","title":"Alabama Board Votes to Remove Transgender-Related Books from Youth Library Sections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Alabama Public Library Service Board of Directors voted to remove books discussing transgender identity, gender ideology, or multiple biological genders from youth and children's sections of public libraries, relocating them to adult sections.

The books must be housed in the adult sections.\n \n\n   \n  Board Chairman John Wahl, who is also chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, called the action “a major step forward in putting parents back in control in what their children are exposed to.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to put Alabama families in charge. We want them to make the decision what is best for their families,” Wahl said.\n \n\n   \n  The state board vote came after a heated public hearing last month. Opponents on Thursday called it an attempt at censorship and the erasure of trans people.\n \n\n   \n  The decision affects more than 200 local libraries and will take effect in 2026 after a required publication period.\n \n\n   \n  The language is being added to existing rules that youth sections must be free of material that is “sexually explicit or other material deemed inappropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  The new language also includes a directive that “all material containing such content must be weeded out of the library’s collection or relocated to an adult section.”\n \n\n   \n  Mack Reynolds held a sign outside the building stating that “positive representation” is not the same as sexually explicit material. He noted that the vote was taking place on Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day that focuses on trans people who have lost their lives because of violence.\n \n\n   \n  Reynolds, who is transgender, said books are the best way for people to learn about people who are different from them.\n \n\n   \n  “What I hope is that other children can approach my daughter with curiosity and compassion. And if they don’t know, then there is so much more room for angst, fear and frustration,” Reynolds said.\n \n\n   \n  The scope of the new rule is not entirely clear. During a public hearing, some proponents had objected to books that teach children about pronouns or describe a child’s experience being transgender. It is less clear if any book with a transgender character would be removed.\n \n\n   \n  “Most of the people of Alabama have not asked for this latest library-fixated assault on the LGBTQ community because it’s their children and children of friends and relatives you’re attacking with this misguided proposal before you,” Jim Vickery told the board during a public comment period.\n \n\n   \n  Board member Amy Minton said most comments that they received during a public comment period were in favor of the change.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what the majority of people of Alabama want,” Minton said.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the proposal said parents who want their children to read the books can get them in other places, including the adult sections of libraries.\n \n\n   \n  Angie Hayden, a co-founder of Read Freely Alabama, said she is concerned the aim is to completely remove the books. She said state regulations do not allow the purchase of books aimed at children if state regulations also deem the book inappropriate for children.\n \n\n   \n  “So long term they are banning these books, slowly removing these books from your public library,” Hayden said.\n \n\n   \n  The board also tightened restrictions on youth library cards, stating that the “standard library card” for minors cannot access books in adult collections. Libraries can issue an all-access card only with the written permission of parents.\n \n\n   \n  Board members also had sharp disagreements over restoring funding to the Fairhope Public Library. The board had moved to withhold funding because of some titles in the teen section.\n \n\n   \n  Board members rejected a proposal to restore funding immediately. Wahl said he wanted to wait until they had reviewed Fairhope’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “John, are you becoming the censor-in-chief for Alabama?” board member Ronald A. Snider asked Wahl.\n \n\n   \n  Snider said the state board is acting like a “board of censorship” when they “second guess” the decisions of professional librarians and local library boards.\n \n\n   \n  “You can call it second-guessing or you can call it accountability,” Wahl replied.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/narrow-house-majority-congress-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority gets a bit more breathing room after Sherrill’s resignation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the resignation of Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill, who accepted a gubernatorial role in New Jersey, the U.S. House of Representatives’ Republican majority has slightly widened to 219 seats, down from 219 to 215 at the start of the 119th Congress.

Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority gets a bit more breathing room after Sherrill’s resignation \n       \n  By Clare Foran, Annette Choi and Ethan Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has bit more room in his narrow House majority after Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill resigned to take office as New Jersey governor.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s resignation, two weeks after her election victory and two months before she takes office, will still leave Johnson needing the near-unanimous support of his party to advance legislation.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats, with three seats vacant. Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote, but has a bit more room for absences in his party.\n \n\n   \n  The next vacant seat to be filled will be in a Republican-leaning district in Tennessee, where a special election is scheduled for early next month. Then, at the end of January, two Texas Democrats will meet in a runoff to fill another vacancy. The special election for Sherrill’s seat is expected to take place early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/ukraine-russia-trump-peace-proposal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:06:00+00:00","title":"Trump’s 28-point peace proposal for Ukraine would require land concessions and military reduction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A draft 28-point peace proposal from the Trump administration outlines a path to end the war in Ukraine, requiring significant territorial concessions including recognition of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as de facto Russian territory, a withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from parts of Donetsk, and a military size cap of 600,000.

Many of the ideas put forward in the 28-point plan have been rejected in previous negotiations by Ukraine and European officials and would be seen as concessions to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  US officials said the plan was still being worked on, and that any final agreement would require concessions from both sides, not just Ukraine. Some of the points being circulated now – including some that appear weighted toward Moscow’s demands – are not final, officials said, and will almost certainly evolve. During a Thursday afternoon briefing, the White House press secretary said the plan remained “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  After meeting a top US military official in Kyiv on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to work with the Trump administration on the new plan, saying in a social media post that he was prepared for “constructive, honest and swift work” to achieve peace.\n \n\n   \n  However, Moscow had not yet been informed that Zelensky was ready to discuss the plan,   a Russian journalist cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying, state media reported Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan, which President Donald Trump has reviewed and supports, is the White House’s latest attempt to bring  Russia’s war in Ukraine  to an end. Some of the proposal’s provisions – including territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia – have previously been nonstarters with the Ukrainians. But US officials see a new window of opportunity to restart peace discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The plan is still in the framework stage, and its many points haven’t been finalized.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the draft plan\n \n\n   \n  Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, the draft describes the plan’s implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “Sanctions will be imposed for violations,” it states.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan would have Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States.” This would mark a stunning reversal of longstanding US policy to acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity and not recognize forcible changes in territory.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan says Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact, “which will mean de facto recognition along the line of contact.”\n \n\n   \n  “Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside the five regions,” it says.\n \n\n   \n  The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan states that Russian forces will not enter the demilitarized zone. The two countries would commit not to change the agreed-upon territorial arrangements by force, or else security guarantees would not apply.\n \n\n   \n  The security guarantees, which the plan says Ukraine will receive, are not detailed in the draft. However, it notes that the US will receive compensation for its guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  If Russia invades Ukraine, “in addition to a decisive coordinated military response, all global sanctions will be reinstated, recognition of the new territory and all other benefits of this deal will be revoked,” the draft states.\n \n\n   \n  “If Ukraine launches a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause, the security guarantee will be deemed invalid,” it notes.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, and that European fighter jets be stationed in Poland.\n \n\n   \n  It limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel. It also calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the creation of a joint US-Russia “working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  It outlines a return of Russia into the global community, including the lifting of sanctions, invitation to rejoin the G8, and its reintegration into the global economy.\n \n\n   \n  The plan would see “all parties” in the war “receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court for the crime of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children. The plan calls for the return of “all civilian detainees and hostages,” including children, and the exchange of all prisoners of war and bodies.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to “be launched under the supervision of the IAEA, and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has made it very clear since day one, and even on the campaign trail, that he wants to see this war come to an end. He has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides of this war, Russia and Ukraine alike, for their refusal to commit to a peace agreement,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing. “Nevertheless, the president and his national security team are steadfast in seeing this war come to an end.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt rejected suggestions the plan was overly weighted toward Moscow, and said the administration had “talked equally with both sides” to create it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine, and we believe that it should be acceptable to both sides, and we’re working very hard to get it done,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Wednesday the document was a “list of potential ideas” rather than a completed proposal.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he wrote in  a post on X.  “And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some of the provisions being floated are likely to draw criticism from Ukraine and its backers since it would require significant land concessions. The two regions that  form the Donbas , Luhansk and Donetsk, are still partially held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal echoes a  peace proposal from talks  in Istanbul in the early weeks of the war in 2022, repeating some of Moscow’s wider geopolitical demands about Ukraine’s armed forces and allegiances.\n \n\n   \n    Talks in Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with Zelensky in Ukraine on Thursday and delivered him the Trump administration’s proposed peace plan, a US defense official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll and Zelensky discussed “a collaborative plan to achieve peace in Ukraine” and “agreed on an aggressive timeline for signature,” the defense official said. The official clarified that the US expected Zelensky to sign a framework with the US to work toward an eventual peace agreement, not sign onto a final peace deal itself.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how aggressive that timeline is, or whether Zelensky agreed to its points. European and Ukrainian officials told CNN on Wednesday that the plan appears to contain unacceptable and maximalist demands from Russia, including ceding territory in the eastern Donbas region that Russia does not even currently control.\n \n\n   \n  But the Ukrainian presidential office said Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President of Ukraine outlined the fundamental principles that matter to our people, and following today’s meeting, the parties agreed to work on the plan’s provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war,” the Ukrainian presidential office said, adding that Zelensky expects to speak with Trump in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why the Army was tasked with delivering the peace plan rather than diplomats, the defense official said the Army “comes from a trusted position” with the Ukrainians, and is also in Ukraine to hold meetings on battlefield innovation — a topic Driscoll has been deeply involved in throughout his tenure as secretary.\n \n\n   \n  “We come from a trusted position. The US Army is a proven Ukraine ally,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundhog Day’\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat echoed a Western official’s description of some of the details of the proposal. The person told CNN that the new effort, which repeats many of Moscow’s maximalist demands dating back to 2022, reminded them of “Groundhog Day,” a film in which events repeat themselves over and over.\n \n\n   \n  A European envoy based in Ukraine said the plan had caught the diplomatic community completely by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been gone through before and rejected, and now we’re back to square one,” the diplomat said. “For the Ukrainians, it is just a non-starter and with good reason. It would just be inviting the Russians to come back again at a future date. It would be political suicide for any Ukrainian leader (to accept it), and it would be military suicide to hand over that fortified area.”\n \n\n   \n  The diplomat also described foreign ministries in Europe and elsewhere calling contacts in Washington for guidance on the plan only to be told they were equally in the dark.\n \n\n   \n  “We have heard directly from people in the State Department and on Capitol Hill that nobody knew anything about this plan until it was leaked yesterday,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  “People who should have known about it, knew nothing about it … There’s a lot of annoyance and confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In her first public comments since reports of the plan emerged, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told reporters Thursday that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, meanwhile, told CNN that any plans should involve Europe and leave Kyiv with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a much bigger stake in this than the US, and therefore Ukraine, but also Europe, has to be involved,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said work on the talks was continuing “at the technical level between the teams” and that they were “carefully studying all of our partners’ proposals, expecting the same respectful attitude towards Ukraine’s position.”\n \n\n   \n  Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, told the Washington Post Live, “This is the start of a good process.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we’re finally having the leadership of the president of the United States, and this leadership is backed up by a real process, I think this is serious,” she said.   \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s special envoy,  Steve Witkoff , has been leading the effort, CNN reported on Wednesday, with a source saying the negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal. A US official said Witkoff had been quietly working on the plan for a month, with input from both the Ukrainians and the Russians on the terms they could accept.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, reiterated its denial that it was working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine, saying Thursday there were “no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have nothing new to add to what was said in Anchorage,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, referencing a meeting between Putin and Trump in Alaska in August. “We have no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Carey, Nick Paton Walsh, Brian Abel, and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/us-navy-south-china-sea-aircraft-salvage-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:31:00-05:00","title":"US Navy Trying to Pull Crashed Aircraft from Bottom of South China Sea","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Navy is attempting to recover an F/A-18 Super Hornet and an MH-60 helicopter that crashed within 30 minutes of each other off the USS Nimitz in late October 2025.

Lendon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:31 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Navy is trying to recover two aircraft from the bottom of the South China Sea that US experts say could yield sensitive information to China if Beijing were to get to them first.\n \n\n   \n  The aircraft – an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet and an MH-60 helicopter –  crashed within 30 minutes of each other  while operating off the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz during routine operations in late October.\n \n\n   \n  No official cause has been given for the crashes, but US President Donald Trump suggested to reporters shortly after the incidents that contaminated fuel may be to blame. All crew members were rescued.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy confirmed to CNN on Friday that a salvage ship was operating in the South China Sea, while not revealing the specific location where the aircraft crashed or where the salvage ship is now.\n \n\n   \n  “USNS SALVOR (T-ARS 52), a Safeguard-class salvage ship operated by Military Sealift Command, is on-scene conducting operations in support of the recovery efforts,” said Cmdr. Matthew Comer, a spokesperson for the Navy’s 7th Fleet in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  The Salvor is capable of lifting objects weighing up to 300 tons off the seafloor, according to Navy documents. The maximum takeoff weight of the newest F/A-18 models on the Nimitz is about 33 tons while the MH-60 weighs around 11 tons.\n \n\n   \n  While neither the F/A-18 nor the MH-60 are the most modern of the Navy’s aircraft, experts say the wrecks could yield useful intelligence if they fall into the hands of an adversary.\n \n\n   \n  “Acquiring an air frame and surviving systems will … provide valuable insights into its technological strengths and how to defeat it tactically,” said Carl Schuster, the former head of the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that an F/A-18 has never fallen into Chinese hands, but if one did, Beijing could gather information that could help it improve People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carrier-based J-15T jets, which are not considered as advanced as the F/A-18.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the MH-60 carries anti-submarine warfare systems that are likely more advanced than China’s, Schuster said.\n \n\n   \n  “China is now prioritizing the upgrading of its anti-submarine warfare systems. So, recovering that helicopter should enjoy a high priority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot confirm whether China is making any attempt to get to the lost US aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea, in defiance of an international court ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The current US recovery effort follows  a similar mission  in 2022, when an F-35 jet, the Navy’s most-advanced fighter,  crashed while attempting to land  on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.\n \n\n   \n  The F-35 was eventually pulled up from 12,400 feet (3,700 meters) of water by a Navy recovery team.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, China has fortified its territorial claims by constructing military installations on contested islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The US says China’s assertions and military buildup threaten freedom of navigation in the waterway, through which trade worth trillions of dollars passes every year.\n \n\n   \n  US forces maintain a steady presence in the region to push back on Chinese sovereignty claims and support Washington’s allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  But Schuster said Beijing has an edge on getting to wrecks in the South China Sea just based on proximity.\n \n\n   \n  “If China makes it a race, it enjoys homefield advantage, if you will, and can be expected to impede our recovery efforts” if possible, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said after the crashes that it could offer humanitarian assistance to the US Navy if needed.\n \n\n   \n  But a spokesperson also said that the crashes occurred during what he called “US military exercises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The US has been flexing muscles by frequently sending military vessels and aircraft to the South China Sea. This is the root cause of security issues at sea and disruption to regional peace and stability,” spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/weather/texas-flash-flood-hill-country-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:26:00-05:00","title":"Flood threat for soaked Dallas and Texas Hill Country persists overnight as storms keep firing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ongoing severe flooding persists in the Texas Hill Country due to persistent storm activity, with over 9 inches of rain causing a flash flood emergency for nearly 1,300 residents.

Waxman, Chris Dolce, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:26 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Significant flooding is underway in Texas Hill Country as storms crawl across the South. Parts of the region are still recovering from devastating flooding that  killed more than 130 people  this July.\n \n\n   \n  Over 9 inches of rain has fallen since Thursday morning in parts of western Hill Country, prompting a flash flood emergency – the highest level of flood alert   – for nearly 1,300 people in southeastern Concho, western McCulloch and central Menard counties Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The significant rainfall led authorities to issue precautionary evacuations at local RV parks and area campsites, county judge Brandon Corbin said in a statement Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The flash flood emergency has been downgraded to a regular flood warning Thursday evening, but officials are not letting down their guard. Western Hill Country could pick up another inch or less of rain before the night is through.\n \n\n   \n  Several flash flood warnings have been issued Thursday in the region, where a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place. The rest of central and northern Texas could also see localized flooding Thursday, including Dallas-Fort Worth. And a second round of downpours could pile onto the state’s flood worries beginning Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Storms were “training” over Hill Country, or lining up and moving over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track. The storms will begin to move east away from the soaked region this evening, ending the threat of additional heavy rainfall.\n \n\n   \n  The Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms.\n \n\n   \n  Farther north, storms in Dallas-Fort Worth triggered flash flood warnings Thursday morning. Several roads were closed because of flooding in the north Dallas area, according to the National Weather Service. Between 2 to 4 inches of rain had fallen. Additional rounds of rain through the early evening could bring another 1 to 4 inches.\n \n\n   \n  Flood watches extend along much of the Interstate 35 corridor from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to Austin into early Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  After drying out Friday and Saturday, a second soaking storm is expected to arrive in Texas as the weekend comes to an end. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall has been issued by the Weather Prediction Center for northern and central parts of Texas from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re in the Hill Country and other parts of Texas, keep phones charged and alerts on and avoid driving through flooded roads.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/chicago-marimar-martinez-shooting-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"09:29:00-05:00","title":"Federal Judge Dismisses Charges Against Chicago Woman Shot After Allegedly Ramming Car at Law Enforcement Vehicle","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Georgia Alexakis, dismissed federal charges against Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American woman, after she was shot by Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum in Chicago on October 4, 2025.

I’m happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been hard,” she said. “I can’t sleep, but now I’m gonna go sleep.”\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been accused of closely pursuing Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4. But Martinez’s defense attorney, Christopher Parente, alleged the opposite, saying it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Parente said, “This case was going to be a winner at trial regardless.”\n \n\n   \n  “These agents were lying about what happened,” he added following the dismissal. “Miss Martinez never rammed anybody. These agents hit Miss Martinez. These agents jumped out and shot Miss Martinez, a US citizen whose only crime was warning her fellow community members that ICE was in the neighborhood.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors had alleged Martinez and Ruiz “aggressively and erratically” followed and then rammed into Exum and other agents inside his vehicle who were on security detail in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Joseph Fitzpatrick, spokesperson and assistant US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said in a statement Thursday his office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz, the largest ever law enforcement surge in the Northern District of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “This continuous review process applies to all matters — whether charged or under investigation,” Fitzpatrick said. “It helps ensure that the interests of justice are served in each and every case, and that those cases that are charged are appropriately adjudicated through our federal court system.”\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After the collision last month, Exum stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez, according to the charging complaint. Martinez suffered five gunshot wounds, Parente previously told CNN. McLaughlin called the shots “defensive.”\n \n\n   \n    Text messages and the federal vehicle were key in the court case\n \n\n   \n  Text messages from Exum were displayed in court earlier this month as Parente sought to prove his claim  the government potentially destroyed evidence  that may have supported the defense when it released Exum’s damaged vehicle and allowed the agent to drive it more than 1,000 miles to his home state of Maine.\n \n\n   \n  Exum texted an  article from The Guardian  on October 7 to a group of other agents, which quoted Parente saying Martinez had “seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum wrote in the next text message.\n \n\n   \n  Another message to the group read, “I have a MOF amendment to add to my story. I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge an “MOF” is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one-up someone wherever possible.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what exactly Exum was responding to, because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text message, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Referencing the messages, Parente said, “He’s going to pay for those shots, and he’s not going to be as proud and as arrogant as he was when he testified in this courthouse a few weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis  said she was skeptical  about why the cars of Martinez and Ruiz were kept in Chicago as evidence, while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally.\n \n\n   \n  “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said previously.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Omar Jimenez and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/philippines-alice-guo-jailed-scams-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Philippines jails former mayor - who officials say faked her nationality to get the job – for human trafficking","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Philippine court convicted Alice Guo, a former mayor of Bamban in Tarlac province, of human trafficking, alleging she used a falsified Filipino identity to run for office and operated a sprawling illegal online scam complex where hundreds of Chinese and foreign nationals were forced to conduct financial scams.

her nationality to get the job – for human trafficking \n       \n  Story by the Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:59 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Philippine court on Thursday convicted a  former mayor , who officials say is a Chinese national, of human trafficking charges for helping establish an illegal online gaming complex in a northern province where hundreds of Chinese and other foreign nationals were forced to conduct scams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pasig city regional trial court in metropolitan Manila sentenced Alice Guo to life in prison with seven other Filipino and Chinese co-accused, and ordered them to pay a fine of 2 million pesos ($34,000) each and compensate several trafficking victims, who filed the complaints.\n \n\n   \n  Guo denied all allegations against her and says she is a Filipino citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Vast online scam centers have  flourished  in Southeast Asia in recent years, especially in the border areas of  Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar . The UN has estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped in virtual slavery by gangs who force them to financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  In the Philippines, scam operations rapidly built vast compounds with buildings or rented upscale offices in Manila’s financial districts and moved around large numbers of workers by bribing authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine authorities allege that Guo is a Chinese national named Guo Huaping, who faked Filipino citizenship to run for mayor of the town of Bamban in northern Tarlac province, where she ran a sprawling illegal scam compound near the town hall.\n \n\n   \n  “They used the parcels of land and buildings to house the trafficked workers and to force them to work as scammers,” the court said in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a ban on hundreds of mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations, which proliferated under the administration of previous President Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos accused the gaming operations of crimes including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnapping and murder.\n \n\n   \n  Many have been raided and shut down since then, with tens of thousands of trafficked workers rescued and sent back to their home countries. But more scam centers remain in operation, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “The conviction of Alice Guo, also known as Guo Hua Ping, is a victory against corruption, human trafficking, cybercrime and many other transnational crimes,” said Sen. Risa Hontiveros. “But it is far from over.”\n \n\n   \n  Hontiveros led televised Senate inquiries last year that exposed underground online scam operations in the Philippines, along with Guo’s alleged criminal involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine security officials and Hontiveros have said the scam centers operated by Guo and other Chinese nationals may have also been used for espionage by China, which has had increasingly fierce territorial conflicts with the Philippines in the South China Sea and has strongly opposed the presence of American forces in the country. The Philippines is the oldest US treaty ally in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to demand accountability from every government agency that failed in their duties, and we will continue to investigate the full extent of Chinese intelligence operations in our country,” Hontiveros said. “And to all others who enabled Alice Guo’s criminal empire: the Philippines is not a playground for exploitation, infiltration and espionage.”\n \n\n   \n  Guo has not been charged with espionage and she denies any connection to spying.\n \n\n   \n  The town of Bamban is located several kilometers (miles) from a Philippine air force base, where American forces have been allowed to maintain a rotating presence with their aircraft and weapons under a 2014 defense pact.\n \n\n   \n  Guo was dismissed from her post as mayor last year by a state Ombudsman, who cited grave misconduct. She fled the Philippines in July 2024, but was tracked down in  Indonesia , where she was arrested and deported to the Philippines. She has been in detention since last year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/style/frida-kahlo-portrait-record-woman-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:54:00Z","title":"Frida Kahlo self-portrait sells for $54.7 million, setting new record for female artists","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frida Kahlo’s self-portrait 'El sueño (La cama)' has set a new record at auction, selling for $54.7 million at Sotheby’s in New York and becoming the most valuable artwork by a female artist.

Frida Kahlo self-portrait sells for $54.7 million, setting new record for female artists \n       \n  By Lianne Kolirin, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:54 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A self-portrait by Mexican artist  Frida Kahlo  has become the most valuable work by a female artist sold at auction after selling for $54.7 million.\n \n\n   \n  “El sueño (La cama)”  –  “The Dream (The Bed)”  –  grabbed the title at Sotheby’s in New York, after it surpassed the existing record held by the late American artist Georgia O’Keeffe. Her “ Jimson Weed/White Flower No.1 ,” which had previously hung in the White House, sold for $44.4 million in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo’s surrealist self portrait, which was sold by a private collector, had been valued at between $40 million and $60 million. Another of the Mexican artist’s self portraits “Diego y yo” (Diego and I) previously held the title for second most expensive artwork sold by a female artist after also being auctioned by Sotheby’s, New York, in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  When sold, that painting became the most expensive piece of Latin American art ever. It’s now been overtaken by Kahlo’s more recent sale, and drops down to second place  –  and third for the most valuable artwork by a woman.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the auction, the painting, which had not been seen publicly for almost three decades, was shown in London, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Paris and New York.\n \n\n   \n  It sees Kahlo lying on a bed that floats against the backdrop of a pale blue sky. Curling green vines envelop her body, while a skeleton wired with dynamite and holding a bouquet of dried flowers lies above her.\n \n\n   \n  The bed was a regular motif in Kahlo’s work. She was confined to her bed for long periods of time as she endured a life of chronic pain following a near-fatal bus accident and subsequent surgeries.\n \n\n   \n  During the long recovery after the accident, Kahlo’s family set up an adapted easel and fitted a mirror to the canopy of the bed so she could continue to paint while lying flat. “I am not dead and I have a reason to live. That reason is painting,” she wrote at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo painted the piece in 1940, which was a turbulent time for the Mexican artist. It was the year that she remarried Diego Rivera after divorcing the fellow artist a year earlier, and was also the year that her former lover, the Russian revolutionary Leon Trosky, was assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  In an email to CNN prior to the auction, Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby’s head of Latin American art, said “El sueño (La cama)” had been “one of very few works of this calibre still in private hands.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frida Kahlo occupies a completely singular place in art history. There’s an almost spiritual connection people have with her paintings, which are so deeply personal yet at the same time resonate universally. We’ve seen it this season while El sueño (La cama) has been on display around the world, with lines out the door,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “This painting has all the hallmarks of a signature Frida: the self-portrait, a surrealist imagery, and most importantly, a psychological intensity and that sense of communion between artist and viewer.”\n \n\n   \n  The painting formed part of the private collection auction “Exquisite Corpus.” It featured more than 80 surrealist paintings, drawings and sculptures, including pieces by René Magritte and Salvador Dali.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/censure-process-congress-bipartisan-reform","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:04:00-05:00","title":"Bipartisan Push to Reform Censure Process Emerges in Congress After Flurry of Complaints Against Lawmakers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a surge of censure complaints against sitting members of Congress, including a vote against Chuy García for allegedly coordinating his retirement and a failed attempt to censure Stacey Plaskett for texting Jeffrey Epstein, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are pushing to reform the censure process.

Stacey Plaskett , for texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, failed on a 209-214 vote. Three Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure and three Republicans registering as “present.”\n \n\n   \n  If the vote to censure Plaskett had passed, Democrats had planned to bring up a resolution against Florida GOP  Rep. Cory Mills , who has faced a swirl of controversies in his time in Congress, including an  allegation of assault  against Mills and  accusations from  an ex-girlfriend that he threatened to release sexually explicit images and videos of her.\n \n\n   \n  But on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina brought a complaint against Mills, pointing to individuals who served with Mills in the Army disputing his version of events that led him to be recommended for the Bronze Star, which was reported on by  NOTUS . The complaint was referred to the House Ethics Committee after a vote to censure him failed despite seven Republicans joining Mace in favor of the measure.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/lawsuit-diddy-assault-jonathan-hay","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:07:00.000+00:00","title":"Jonathan Hay’s Allegations Against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs Now at Center of New LA Sheriff’s Investigation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Hay, a music producer and publicist, has come forward with allegations of sexual battery against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, claiming incidents in 2020 and 2021 during a tribute project to Notorious B.I.G.

After speaking with the attorney’s office, Hay got cold feet, fearful of standing up against a figure as powerful as Combs. He was, he said, “terrified.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reviewed email correspondence showing Hay reached out to the civil attorney’s office in March 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, I can’t do this,” Hay said of his first attempt to come forward with his claims against Combs in early 2023. “I’m just not ready.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay finally filed his claims against Combs – then as a “John Doe” – in July 2025, shortly after Combs was convicted by a New York jury on two federal prostitution-related counts that would lead to him being sentenced to more than four years.\n \n\n   \n  Once Ventura filed her lawsuit and dozens of other civil accusers came forward with lawsuits, he felt encouraged to tell his story. Hay said that he’d never considered that there could have been others who had allegedly been abused by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs denies all accusations against him.  Roughly 70 accusers  have brought civil lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  “Once Cassie’s lawsuit came out,” Hay said, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go. And then once the raids happened, I was like holy crap. That’s when I was like, ‘Okay, now is my time. Finally, I just decided that, alright, I’m going to go forward with this.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted someone to listen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Hay’s claims are at the center of a new investigation, launched this week by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Department confirmed that their Special Victims Bureau is investigating Hay’s claims after receiving a copy of his police report, first documented in September 2025 by police in Largo, Florida, where Hay resides.\n \n\n   \n  In the police report, Hay says he suffered from sexual battery by Combs in 2020, and then again in 2021, when he was working on a remix of Christopher “The Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace’s music as a tribute project, honoring one of Combs’ closest collaborators. Hay worked on the new music with the rapper’s son, CJ Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2020 incident, Hay said he was working at a photoshoot when he found himself in the same room as Combs, who began to masturbate into one of Biggie’s shirts. The police report details that Combs “removed the shirt to uncover his penis and told Hay to come finish him off.” The report states that Hay told police he was in shock and “stated that Combs then finished himself off and ejaculated on one of Notorious B.I.G. shirts” and then threw the shirt on Hay, “simultaneously saying, ‘Rest in peace BIG.’”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Hay told police that Combs forced him to perform oral sex on him, which he said made him feel suicidal.\n \n\n   \n  Hay said that a detective from the LASD’s Special Victims Bureau contacted him on Tuesday this week to notify him that she had been assigned to his case.\n \n\n   \n  Hay is cooperating with authorities, hopeful that their active investigation may lead to further criminal charges.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggie was like his supposedly his best friend,” he said. “To just do that in a shirt and to attack me like he had?” Hay said. “He doesn’t need to be out on the streets.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality’\n \n\n   \n  Hay’s allegations first became public this July when he filed his lawsuit anonymously against both Combs and Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace is named as a defendant with Hay claiming that he and others “conspired” with Combs to “allow or assist in Combs’ ability to carry out” his actions against Hay.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace has filed a defamation suit against Hay. In it, he claims that Hay falsified these accusations because he was “irate” that Biggie’s estate decided not to release the majority of the songs produced back in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “Jonathan Hay’s allegations against CJ Wallace will be shown to be a complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality,” Jeremiah Reynolds, an attorney for Wallace, told CNN. “We look forward to Hay eventually being held liable in court for defamation.”\n \n\n   \n  “CJ knows what happened,” Hay said. “He was there. He lived it.”\n \n\n   \n  Combs also denies Hay’s claims, as he has done with the dozens of accusers who have sued him.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, a lawyer for Combs issued a blanket denial statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As Mr. Combs’ legal team has repeatedly stated for over a year now, he cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a media circus. Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone,” Jonathan Davis, a civil attorney for Combs, said in a statement. “He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided – and not in the media – based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay said he is not surprised that Combs continues to deny his allegations, and he remains focused on pursuing justice through his case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that when he gets out of jail,” Hay said, “that he is taken straight to jail in California, or to go through the court proceedings in California, and that he spends the rest of his life in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  After a two-month federal trial in New York earlier this year, Combs is currently serving his four-plus year sentence at Fort Dix federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to respect the jurors and the decision that they made,” Hay said of the conviction, which Combs is currently appealing. “At least he got some time. And hopefully we can add more.”\n \n\n   \n   Jason Kravarik contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/justice-department-adam-schiff-ed-martin-bill-pulte-christine-bish","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:52:00-05:00","title":"Justice Department Investigates Alleged Impersonation in Mortgage Fraud Probes of Prominent Democrats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether individuals impersonated federal agents in mortgage fraud probes targeting prominent Democrats, including Sen.

Katelyn  Polantz, Hannah Rabinowitz, Devan Cole, Casey Gannon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:52 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether people impersonated federal agents in mortgage fraud probes of prominent Democrats, a development that could complicate efforts to prosecute political enemies of President Donald Trump, people briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The new probe led by the Maryland US Attorney’s Office and the Federal Housing Finance Agency inspector general is examining the handling of the mortgage fraud investigations into California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  One witness in the Schiff matter, a Republican from California named Christine Bish, said she traveled to Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday morning in response to a grand jury subpoena. Bish said she spoke to federal investigators inside the courthouse who asked her about people who told her they were working with Trump administration officials leading the mortgage probes.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re investigating each other,” Bish later told CNN in a telephone interview. “It’s stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  The subpoena Bish received demanded she give to the prosecutors in Maryland any communications she had with “any person or persons claiming to be” working under the Federal Housing Finance Director  Bill Pulte , the Justice Department official  Ed Martin , or others “claiming to be acting at the direction or request” of them or their offices, according to the subpoena reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte helped to prompt the Schiff and James investigations, as well as mortgage fraud-related inquiries into other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte in particular has played an extraordinary role in the probes by publicly making criminal referrals to the Justice Department, a step normally taken through mortgage investigators in his agency. And Martin has touted his pursuit of Trump’s political foes.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors are also looking into whether grand jury materials gathered in the James case were illegally shared with people who were not authorized to review it, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. James has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department declined to comment. The FHFA, its inspector general’s office and Martin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Pulte also were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  Bish, who previously ran for office in California, has publicly said she had information to share about Schiff related to his mortgages. She told CNN on Thursday that when she came to the Greenbelt courthouse, she believed she was going to provide grand jury testimony on Schiff and mortgage fraud, but that prosecutors “seemed more concerned” about looking into whether “there was conspiracy or collusion between me and Pulte or me and Ed Martin.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she passed her independent findings on Schiff to Pulte’s office earlier this year, after she said his office contacted her directly.\n \n\n   \n  Schiff is one of Trump’s longtime political foes, with the president in September pushing in a Truth Social post for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute him.\n \n\n   \n  “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action,”  Trump wrote in the post . “Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office have been hesitant to proceed with charges against Schiff, CNN previously reported. Schiff has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crime, and his attorney declined to comment for this story Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re trying to tie me into some kind of clandestine conspiracy, it’s not there, and the best way to protect myself is to be open and honest and public,” Bish said Thursday, adding later: “Something’s not adding up. And I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but I will.”\n \n\n   \n  The interview questions Bish was asked on Thursday went beyond any probe into Schiff, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “They assured me, when they interviewed me, that the focus of the investigation was Adam Schiff. And I kept pulling the testimony back to Schiff, but it seemed like they were looking for more — stuff that doesn’t exist,” Bish said at the courthouse on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators focused their questions on two people whom Bish said reached out to her for information on Schiff.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people worked in the first Trump administration and claimed to work for Pulte, and Bish said she spoke to the person several times. The other person said he was affiliated with the mortgage agency Freddie Mac, according to Bish, and she said she spoke to him once.\n \n\n   \n  “You know – had I ever talked to Director Pulte? Had I ever talked to Ed Martin? Did I have any communication with them? And that’s where the conversation kept going back,” she added. “So I don’t know if they’re on a fishing expedition or you know what’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she has never spoken with Martin.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Evan Perez and Kara Scannell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and comment. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-mack-rhoades-resigns-from-baylor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:51:00-05:00","title":"Baylor AD Mack Rhoades Resigns, a Week After Taking Leave for Personal Reasons","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Baylor University announced the resignation of Athletic Director Mack Rhoades on November 20, 2025, a week after he took a leave of absence for personal reasons.

schools had submitted the paperwork to request the recission, the source said. The magic number to stop the rule switch is 241 – or two-thirds of the 361 Division I member institutions. If that threshold isn’t met, college athletes, coaches and staff will be permitted to gamble on professional sports by Saturday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed switch comes at a time when sports gambling is under heightened scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  In the last month,  federal authorities  have arrested two  Major League Baseball  players (Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz), as well as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones – all accused of taking part in separate gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  In addition,  six college basketball players  have been deemed permanently ineligible for participating in game fixing activities, and Congress has called on sports leaders to ensure the integrity of sports.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the NCAA held steady, prohibiting its athletes, staff and coaches from betting on any sport in which it crowned a champion. Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not. But citing the growth in legal sports betting nationwide – now permissible in 38 states – and arguing that sports betting was now available to regular college students, the NCAA agreed to change its policy. Betting on college sports would still be against the rules.\n \n\n   \n  The rule change originally was meant to go into effect on November 1 – a week after the sweeping indictments involving the NBA and members of New York crime families. While the optics weren’t good, the actual implementation of the rule was delayed because of a technicality – less than 75% of the cabinet members voted in favor of the change, triggering an automatic rescission period.\n \n\n   \n  That rescission period ends Friday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/football-nfl-cowboys-ceedee-lamb-missed-curfew-explanation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:08:00Z","title":"CeeDee Lamb Says Casino Visit Led to Curfew Violation with Fellow Cowboys Receiver George Pickens","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, Dallas Cowboys wide receivers, were benched for the first series of their 33-16 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders due to a curfew violation after spending time at the Red Rock Casino the night before the game.

Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:36 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weeks into the job,  Japan ’s new leader has come face-to-face with what it means to cross  China ’s red line on Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since  Sanae Takaichi  suggested her country could respond militarily if China were to move to take control of Taiwan by force, Beijing has pulled out its economic pressure playbook: warning its citizens against travel and study there, suggesting there’ll be no market in China for Japan’s seafood exports, and unleashing a wave of wall-to-wall nationalist fervor pointed at the prime minister.\n \n\n   \n   The furor  appears carefully calibrated to send a warning to Japan – and other countries in the region – of what could happen if they even consider taking a stance at odds with China on Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that Beijing claims as its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  But the spat, which shows no sign of abating roughly two weeks on, also reveals something else: Beijing’s deep-seated concerns about the potential for changing military postures in Asia – as US allies ramp up defense spending and coordination in the face of its own  rising military might .\n \n\n   \n  No other country piques those concerns like Japan, whose Imperial Army in the 20th century invaded, occupied and waged atrocities on China and, decades earlier, colonized Taiwan – key pain points in China’s so-called “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers.\n \n\n   \n  Anti-Japanese sentiment has simmered in the country since that time – flaring up and gaining traction in recent years with nationalist hardliners’ voices becoming increasingly mainstream in China under strongman leader Xi Jinping.\n \n\n   \n  Reinforcing the ruling Communist Party’s longstanding determination to ensure history can never repeat itself, Xi has rapidly modernized China’s military and grown its global influence.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in Beijing’s eyes, Takaichi’s comments reveal that Japan does not respect the vast rebalancing of power that’s positioned China as an ascendant superpower – and that it has military ambitions that could threaten China’s rise.\n \n\n   \n  “For the first time, a Japanese leader has expressed ambitions for armed intervention in Taiwan and issued a military threat against China,” a commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily  said  earlier this week. “Behind this lies the dangerous attempt by Japan’s right-wing forces to break free from the constraints of the pacifist constitution and seek the status of a ‘military power.’”\n \n\n   \n    Japan’s ‘militarism’\n \n\n   \n  Japan has made a  sweeping shift  in its security posture in recent years, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, to boost its defense budget and acquire counterstrike capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  That’s come as Beijing has ramped up its military activities in the region, including around Taiwan – and as the US has pushed its allies for more burden-sharing on defense spending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response, but politicians – particularly among right wingers in Takaichi’s party – are increasingly wary of the implications for Tokyo if Beijing attacks Taiwan, which sits strategically to Japan’s south. This sentiment has resulted in a growing impetus to further expand Japan’s defense spending and even change the constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Now Takaichi, a hawkish figure who has previously drawn Beijing’s ire for questioning some of the narratives around imperial Japan’s culpability for its war atrocities, has taken the step of speaking plainly on the Taiwan issue. In the first days of her term, she also called for closer security ties with the US and is moving to accelerate the country’s defense build-up.\n \n\n   \n  In Beijing’s eyes,  according to  a social media account linked to the Chinese military, such efforts run the risk of seeing “the ‘ghost’ of militarism” reemerge “to wreak havoc in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  And that’s why some on the Japanese side feel that Beijing is lashing out now “to box Takaichi in and put her on the back foot early on – so she will be more reluctant to push forward on Japan’s investment in defense,” according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed civilians during its occupation, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the Nanjing Massacre, one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century. Japan has repeatedly apologized and expressed remorse for its wartime atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  That era, however, has been front and center in China this year as Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II, when Japan’s surrender to Allied Forces freed China from its occupation and saw Taiwan handed over to the Nationalist-run Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Communist Party established the People’s Republic of China in 1949 after emerging victorious from a civil war, while the defeated Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. Beijing has used the anniversary to justify its claim to the island – and broadcast concern about what it sees as Japan’s turn toward militarism.\n \n\n   \n  China sees taking control of Taiwan as a core piece of the “national rejuvenation” that it must complete by mid-century – a goal that, if Beijing decides must be achieved by force, could be heavily complicated by a stronger Japan.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, Takaichi’s comments can be summed up as “the wrong person, talking about the wrong thing” at the “wrong time,” according to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Defending its sovereignty’\n \n\n   \n  Despite Tokyo dispatching an envoy to Beijing earlier this week to calm the dispute, Beijing has showed no signs of dialing back its deluge of rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  It’s instead insisting Tokyo retracts the comment – a position that offers neither side an easy way to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, China has continued to stoke nationalist feelings, including sabre-rattling from China’s military, which on Wednesday released a video titled “Don’t be too cocky.” Without mentioning Japan by name, it includes a rap crooning: “We’ve honed our skills through rigorous training, how can we allow you to be so cocky?”\n \n\n   \n  But it may be an image of Japan’s foreign ministry envoy Masaaki Kanai and his Chinese counterpart Liu Jinsong following their meeting in Beijing earlier this week that underscores why China won’t want to ease up pressure just yet.\n \n\n   \n  That image – showing Liu standing straight with his hands in his pockets, talking to Kanai who tilts his head forward while listening – has gone viral across Chinese social media.\n \n\n   \n  Commentators have referred to the Japanese diplomat as “bowing,” while they hailed the choice of Liu’s attire – a suit whose style is associated with China’s May Fourth anti-Imperialism movement of 1919.\n \n\n   \n  The symbolism, it appears, was no coincidence: “China’s stance in defending its sovereignty remains unchanged for a century,” said a caption on a post from state broadcaster CCTV.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/fugees-pras-michel-sentenced-prison-obama","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00-05:00","title":"Fugees Rapper Pras Michel Sentenced to 14 Years in Prison for Illegal Donations to Obama Campaign","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pras Michel, a Grammy-winning rapper and founding member of the Fugees, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for illegally funneling over $120 million in foreign contributions from Malaysian billionaire Jho Low to Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign.

The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said “betrayed his country for money” and “lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.”\n \n\n   \n  “His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,”  they wrote .\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client’s 14-year sentence is “completely disproportionate to the offense.” Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence.

Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “Low’s motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,” Michel’s attorneys wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel’s request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney’s  use of a generative AI program  during his closing of the trial’s arguments.

Alvarez, Taylor Romine, Chris Boyette, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:45 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The dayslong immigration crackdown that arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week appeared to end with the same level of confusion it began with, as local officials announced the operation concluded Thursday while federal officials refuted those claims.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Thursday, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden issued a statement saying the federal immigration enforcement operation in the city had ended. But moments later, a top Department of Homeland Security official rejected that characterization.\n \n\n   \n  DHS dubbed the operation in Charlotte, which led to over 370 arrests, “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Over more than five days, enforcement actions disrupted life across the city, resulting in business closures, children kept out of school, and widespread fear in the community.\n \n\n   \n  At the helm of the operation was top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who, along with some of his federal agents, left Charlotte Thursday, according to a Homeland Security official, fueling confusion about the state of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the sheriff’s statement was released, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “Wrong. Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification on the operation’s status. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office says it stands by its statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to  what happened in Chicago  after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his agents are  expected to launch an operation in New Orleans  after the Thanksgiving holiday ,  as early as December 1, continuing the recent focus on city-specific immigration enforcement operations.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said  in a post  following McFadden’s announcement that she is “relieved for our community,” and urged the city to “come together” as they move forward.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said in a statement Thursday. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust.\n \n\n   \n    Federal agents leave behind a city rocked by fear and confusion\n \n\n   \n  In the few days that federal agents focused their immigration enforcement crackdown on North Carolina’s largest city,  fear and confusion  swept through the Charlotte community.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN’s Gustavo Valdes she had been getting questions from students such as, “What is going to happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?” and “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  She described having only nine students show up on one day this week, as parents were afraid to send their children to school or, in some cases, parents with legal status drove the children of undocumented parents to class.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students — about 20% of district enrollment — were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said, citing updated data from the beginning of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  When a CNN crew in a black SUV was parked near a school this week, an official asked them to move their vehicle because it resembled a CBP vehicle and was frightening parents picking up their children.\n \n\n   \n  One  nonprofit  estimates about half of the mom-and-pop businesses it works with have  closed at some point  during the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  A family-run Colombian bakery, which has closed only once in its 28-year history,  closed last week, with the family unsure of when it will reopen .\n \n\n   \n  While some in the community are expressing relief that the operation may be over, others remain skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that provides legal services to people in removal proceedings,  warned the community  not to “let your guard down” as ICE is still operating in the area and other parts of the state.\n \n\n   \n  “CBP might be leaving but ICE is still here!” the group said in an Instagram post.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte and Chicago could help New Orleans prepare\n \n\n   \n  While the Charlotte operation appears to have concluded, an immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans is expected as early as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Some in Charlotte’s community  adopted tactics  they saw activists use in Chicago, such as watching for raids, blowing warning whistles, and carrying signs advising people of their rights. In Charlotte,  some  also  stood outside the entrance  of a local ICE processing facility to block federal agents, a method frequently seen at the  Broadview ICE facility  near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Both cities  quickly mobilized  to train community members on how to respond if they saw an immigration raid or ICE presence.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte was a departure from what is typical in these operations, notably being much shorter — at less than a week — than the operation in Chicago, which started in early September.\n \n\n   \n  The operation also  took Charlotte by surprise , as President Donald Trump had not mentioned the city as a target. In contrast, while local and state officials in Chicago said federal officials  hadn’t shared details  about the operation or its timing, Trump  frequently named Chicago  as a  target  for a federal crime crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The focus now appears to be shifting to New Orleans, a city President Trump considered sending the National Guard to  as early as September . New Orleans would be one of the first Democratic-led cities in a Republican-led state targeted for an immigration enforcement operation. CNN has reached out to local and state officials to see how they are preparing for the potential operation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2024/11/27/health/food-safety-thanksgiving-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:35:00-05:00","title":"How long can a Thanksgiving buffet sit out?

A doctor explains \n       \n  By Katia Hetter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:35 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Nearly 82 million  Americans are expected to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday, including many of you.\n \n\n   \n  As family and friends gather together to share meals, it may be good to remember that foodborne illnesses are  on the rise . These are mostly preventable with the right precautions.\n \n\n   \n  I want to make sure that the food my family and I are preparing is safe—and so are the leftovers, so I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where her responsibilities included overseeing food safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   What causes foodborne infections? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Foodborne infections are caused by pathogens, like bacteria, viruses and parasites. In the US, the most common form of foodborne infection is  norovirus , which is a contagious virus that spreads from person to person through sharing utensils or touching objects that an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth. There are also several bacteria that cause foodborne illness, including salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter and listeria.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What symptoms do people experience? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Typical symptoms of foodborne illness include abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Many people recover within 24 hours, but some can become very ill, depending on the pathogen and their underlying medical conditions. Those at highest risk for complications are young children, pregnant women, older individuals and people with immunocompromising medical illnesses.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: I’ve seen a lot of recalls for food products.  How do I make sure that the food I’m preparing is OK before placing it out at meals? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Rhere have been  several instances of high-profile food recalls , but it’s important to remember that the majority of foodborne illnesses occur in everyday settings that don’t involve high-profile cases. Definitely be aware of food recalls (the US government maintains a  comprehensive list of recent recalls ) and make sure that you don’t have products in your fridge or pantry that are deemed unsafe. But don’t obsess over it, as chances are that the food you buy will be safe. However, there are many other things that you can and need to do make sure you abide by safe food preparing practices.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Let’s talk about some of these best practices. How do I defrost my turkey safely? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This is a great question and applies not only to turkey but also to other poultry and meat. The concern is to keep bacteria from growing when the turkey thaws.\n \n\n   \n  There are  three ways to safely thaw turkey . The easiest, though the one that takes the longest, is to thaw in the refrigerator. You put the turkey in a container to prevent it from dripping onto other food. It generally takes 24 hours for each four to five pounds of turkey, so an 8-pound turkey could take two days, and a 12-pound turkey could take three days.\n \n\n   \n  The second way is to wrap the turkey in a leak-proof bag and submerge it in cold water. This takes about 30 minutes per pound, so the 8-pound turkey will take about 4 hours to thaw. You could use tap water and change the water every 30 minutes. It’s important to cook the turkey immediately after it is thawed to prevent bacteria growth.\n \n\n   \n  The third way is to use a microwave. How long it will take depends on the specific microwave. This is the fastest method, but because some parts of the turkey will start to cook during microwaving, it’s essential to cook the turkey right after thawing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not a good idea to leave the turkey thawing on the counter in a warm room. That’s because parts of the turkey may still be frozen while some parts reach high enough temperature for the bacteria to rapidly multiply.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How long can a Thanksgiving buffet sit out? Does it vary by dish? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The rule of thumb to keep in mind is the “two-hour rule.” Once the food is cooked, it should not be left at room temperature for  more than two hours . In the summer, if this is an outdoor picnic and the temperature is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, food should be refrigerated after an hour.\n \n\n   \n  This rule applies to all perishable foods, including meat, fish and milk products. Cooked leftovers should be refrigerated. The foods that do not need to be refrigerated according to the two-hour rule are baked goods such as cookies and cakes, dried meat such as jerky, whole fruit that is not chopped, and nuts.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What if the food is on a burner or in a slow cooker to keep it warm? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The temperature at which bacteria multiples rapidly is between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. If the food is being kept warm by an appliance such that is over 140 degrees Fahrenheit — or if it’s being kept cooled at below 40 degrees Fahrenheit — this does not count toward the two-hour rule. But  within two hours  of removing from the warming or cooling apparatus, it needs to be refrigerated.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: The fridge is my friend, right? Can food go into the fridge so we can enjoy leftovers the next day? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes, if it is stored in a timely manner in the refrigerator. Leftovers can typically be kept in the fridge for  three to four days . They can also be frozen for three to four months.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other safety tips people should keep in mind before gatherings? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  We’ve talked about thawing and storage of leftovers, and we also need to discuss cooking or reheating to the right temperature. The temperature varies  depending  on the type of meat or fish. An internal meat thermometer is crucial for monitoring the temperature. Make sure that fish is cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and chicken, turkey and poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n \n\n   \n  Be aware of cross-contamination. Do not use containers or utensils you have used with raw meat or fish to touch other products, like vegetables and fruits.\n \n\n   \n  Also, remember that norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness. People who have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps or other symptoms of norovirus should not prepare food. Everyone should wash their hands often and well with soap and water.\n \n\n   \n  Event hosts should also ask that those who are experiencing signs of respiratory infection to stay home. And those who are especially vulnerable to severe illness due to underlying conditions should take additional precautions that are appropriate for their individual circumstance.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/hang-democrats-trump-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-05:00","title":"Why Democrats Are Warning About Trump Giving Illegal Orders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrats, including Representative Jason Crow, have issued a video urging military members not to obey unlawful orders from President Donald Trump, citing recent proposals and actions—such as strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific—that appear to violate international and domestic law.

And yet again, he’s basing this argument on a rather novel legal theory and a dubious interpretation of the facts.\n \n\n   \n  A half-dozen congressional Democrats cut a video this week urging members of the military  not to obey unlawful orders  that Trump might issue. Trump then responded by issuing a series of social media posts suggesting these members had committed sedition and possibly even deserved to die.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from saying they should be arrested, to re-posting someone who said George Washington would “HANG THEM,” to saying “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Thursday that Trump  does not, in fact, want members of Congress put to death .\n \n\n   \n  But she otherwise stood by the idea that these members were acting dangerously and undermining the commander in chief. She said the members were urging members of the military to “defy the chain of command.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are literally saying to 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers to defy the chain of command – not to follow lawful orders,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  But that is not what they were literally saying.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the members were not urging anyone to disobey “lawful orders.” They explicitly referred in the video only to  unlawful  orders – and repeatedly so.\n \n\n   \n  The other problem is that “defying the chain of command” isn’t just something military servicemembers are  allowed  to do in such cases; it’s something they’re often  required  to do.\n \n\n   \n  The section of Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice dealing with failing to obey orders states that members can only be sanctioned for disobeying lawful orders. And servicemembers are generally obligated to not follow orders that are “manifestly unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  If there’s a potentially more legitimate objection to Democrats’ video, it’s that they’re erecting a straw man – basically that they’re inventing out of whole cloth the prospect of Trump issuing illegal orders, in order to make military servicemembers hesitant to abide his orders.\n \n\n   \n  This is the argument that some of Trump’s allies have gone for on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t name the unlawful orders that these guys are bringing up in their video, you know, that just shows me that you don’t have the courage to even call out what you’re talking about,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum in a separate segment pressed Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, one of the lawmakers in the video, repeatedly on the same subject.\n \n\n   \n  “What specific order from the commander in chief that we are asking our military to carry out are you objecting to?” MacCallum said. “This is very, very vague.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not as if this is a prospect Democrats have invented out of whole cloth. Trump has given them plenty to work with, including some things  Crow mentioned in the interview .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly proposed doing things – with the military and otherwise – that appear to be illegal. People who served with him have said he suggested illegal action. And Trump is certainly testing the bounds of the law with his use of the military even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  The big example right now is Trump’s strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean – strikes that have  killed more than 80 people  without a legal process.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that both the United Nations and top allies like the United Kingdom regard the strikes  as illegal extrajudicial killings . Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has echoed those claims, while other GOP senators have questioned their legality as well. The administration has also declined to publicly detail its legal justification, even as the Justice Department has produced a  classified legal opinion  authorizing the strikes. It has released survivors of the strikes who, if they had been kept in US custody, could have  forced it to defend itself in court . Also, a top commander who CNN has reported  raised questions about the legality of the strikes  is now retiring early.\n \n\n   \n  There is a very real question about whether the servicemembers involved in those strikes are carrying out illegal orders.

meeting on settler violence.\n \n\n   \n  According to witnesses and WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, settlers torched a vehicle scrapyard in the town of Huwara in the northern West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military said its soldiers were dispatched to Huwara after receiving reports of Israeli civilians throwing rocks toward Palestinian vehicles, setting fire and damaging property.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows numerous cars on fire as firefighters try to extinguish the blaze. Thick, black smoke pours into the night sky from the fire that appears to spread over a sizable area.\n \n\n   \n  Mohammed Dalal, who owns the scrapyard, says more than a dozen settlers descended on the site, smashing cars and starting the fire. He says no one was in the scrapyard at the time, but he estimated that 150 cars were torched or damaged.\n \n\n   \n  “I have children in university, I have grandchildren, I have a family; we all depend on this scrapyard,” Dalal told CNN. “Like many Palestinians, I have olive trees, but I haven’t been able to harvest my olives and so this is our only source of income. All I can do is ask God to compensate us.”\n \n\n   \n  The attack happened the same evening Netanyahu convened a security meeting on settler violence in the West Bank, according to two Israeli officials, which has surged in recent weeks and months. It’s unclear if any decision was reached on how to respond to the escalating attacks. On Monday in a rare condemnation of settler violence, Netanyahu said the attacks were being carried out by “a small, extremist group.”\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Defense Minister Israel Katz declared that Israel will no longer use administrative detention against Israeli settlers, preventing the country’s security apparatus from using one of its most powerful tools to incarcerate settlers while still employing it widely against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledge that cars had been set on fire in the Palestinian town, not far from the settlement of Yitzhar, which is known for its extremist ideology. The IDF said there were no injuries following the incident and soldiers conducting searches did not find any suspects.\n \n\n   \n  This latest attack is the second major arson in a matter of days after dozens of settlers set fire to Palestinian homes and vehicles to the south of Bethlehem. Last week, settlers launched a  major arson attack  on an agricultural area in the northern West Bank, setting fire to trucks, metal sheds and more.\n \n\n   \n  Huwara has come under settler attack before. In June 2023,  settlers rampaged through the town , killing one Palestinian man and wounding hundreds of others in what the former IDF military chief later called a “pogrom.” The large-scale attack was billed as “revenge” after a Palestinian gunman killed two brothers who lived nearby.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/north-korea-operatives-fake-job-portal-ai-firms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"North Korean operatives running fake job portal targeting US AI firms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korean operatives have launched a new cyber campaign by creating a fake job portal that mimics legitimate platforms like Lever, targeting applicants of major US artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency firms.

Korean operatives created a fake job-application platform targeting applicants to major US artificial intelligence and crypto firms as part of a new effort to steal money and know-how for the Kim Jong Un regime,  researchers said  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a twist on a yearslong campaign to infiltrate Fortune 500 companies: Instead of simply impersonating employees of those companies,  North Korean  tech workers are now working to gain long-term access to the computers of applicants before they join a company, according to security firm Validin, which discovered the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  “Going after job seekers gives North Korean actors a huge advantage. Instead of trying to slip past an employer’s defenses, they take over the entire hiring process and make it feel completely legitimate to individuals,” Validin’s chief executive Kenneth Kinion told CNN. “People assume they’re doing a normal coding test or following steps for a promising job opportunity, so they’re far more likely to run whatever the interviewer sends them.”\n \n\n   \n  The fake jobs platform mimics the style and substance of Lever, a headhunting platform that boasts tens of thousands of customers. Among the fictional jobs advertised on the North Korean-built platform are a “product manager” related to Claude, the popular AI model developed by San Francisco-based firm Anthropic.\n \n\n   \n  Anthropic’s technology is in high demand. The firm committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft’s compute capacity to expand the use of Claude, Microsoft announced this week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from Lever, Anthropic and all the other companies impersonated in the scheme. The North Korean diplomatic mission in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Because many candidates don’t want their current employer to know they’re looking elsewhere, they’re less likely to report anything suspicious, making it even easier for the attackers to slip through unnoticed,” Kinion said.\n \n\n   \n  Kinion, whose team discovered the fake job portal this week, said he wasn’t aware of anyone who has fallen victim to the scheme yet, but many have fallen for past industrial espionage campaigns tied to Pyongyang.\n \n\n   \n  For years, North Korean workers have used fraudulent identities and sometimes passed interview screenings to infiltrate American companies big and small. The workers then send the money back to Pyongyang to support the regime’s rogue weapons program, according to private experts and US officials.\n \n\n   \n  A previous CNN  investigation  showed how the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korean hackers have also  stolen billions of dollars  from banks and cryptocurrency firms over the last several years, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. A White House official  estimated  in 2023 that half of  North Korea’s  missile program had been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft.\n \n\n   \n  A series of US indictments and sanctions has raised awareness of the insider IT worker threat. Pyongyang has evolved its tactics in response, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  “These operators appear to hold elevated privileges, far beyond what a standard IT worker receives, which is evident from their more malicious activities,” Michael Barnhart, a North Korea-focused researcher at insider threat firm DTEX Systems, told CNN. “This reinforces the notion that these activities are part of a broader, well-integrated ecosystem within North Korea’s cyber operations.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-democrats-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00Z","title":"Trump Accuses Democratic Lawmakers of 'Seditious Behavior, Punishable by Death' After Video Urging Military to Refuse Illegal Orders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump responded to a video from six Democratic lawmakers—Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, and Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio, and Chrissy Houlahan—who urged military and intelligence personnel to refuse illegal orders by declaring that their actions constitute 'seditious behavior' punishable by death.

by death’ \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Arlette Saenz, Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Thursday suggested that Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials  to disobey illegal orders  should be put to death, sparking an outcry among Democrats on Capitol Hill that the president was seeking to incite violence.\n \n\n   \n  “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, responding to a video from half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military and intelligence community urging people currently in those roles to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote. He also reposted several other users’ posts, including one that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”\n \n\n   \n  The comments drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who condemned Trump’s comments as an attempt to incite violence, and even drew the scrutiny of members in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally who served as a lawyer for the military reserves, said the president’s remarks were “over the top,” though he also said he considered the Democrats’ video “despicable.” And GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he didn’t think it was “really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later denied that Trump was calling for lawmakers to be executed, arguing that the members of Congress with national security backgrounds should not be encouraging anyone to defy orders from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These members knew what they were doing. They were leaning into their credentials, as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander in chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him and you can betray your oath of office,” Leavitt said. “That is a very, very dangerous message. And it perhaps is punishable by law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers in the video – Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan – vowed they “will not be intimidated.”\n \n\n   \n  “What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the lawmakers said in part.\n \n\n   \n  “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.”\n \n\n   \n  Slotkin was accompanied by USCP officers to an event in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Her team requested the additional presence from USCP for the event that took place off Capitol Hill, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n   “I think when a lion’s share of Americans understand that it is in their own power to push back on this kind of rhetoric and this kind of threat, that’s when we actually turn the tide,” she said at the event.\n \n\n   \n  Deluzio called for both parties to unite against what he called Trump’s “outrageous call for political violence.” “It’s a moment where Democrats and Republicans and everyone else in the country should condemn his calls for political violence,” he said on CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Crow, meanwhile, warned on CNN that Trump’s comments should be taken seriously. “We have to take everything that Donald Trump says seriously. He throws a lot of stuff out there, but some of the things he carries through on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the comments “an outright threat” and that Trump was “calling for the execution of elected officials.” He added from the Senate floor: “This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team said they had been in touch with law enforcement authorities to make sure lawmakers were protected.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families. Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the president’s comments, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he didn’t agree with them but dismissed the video that sparked his reaction as “unnecessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t agree with that. Obviously, everyone has their First Amendment rights. But what they did was ill-advised and provocative and unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, similarly called the video “wildly inappropriate,” as he defended Trump. Though he later conceded he wouldn’t have used the same language.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to allow others to make legal judgments about how that…the words that the President chose are not the ones that I would use, OK,” Johnson said Thursday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, I don’t think that this is…these are crimes punishable by death or any of that,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The lawmakers who posted the video that sparked Trump’s reaction did not specify which orders service members received, or might receive, that could be illegal. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said in the video, adding, “Know that we have your back. … Don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at those lawmakers’ actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat Party.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/weather/polar-vortex-cold-snowy-december-stratosphere","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:17:00Z","title":"Polar Vortex Disruption on the Way: A Rare November Event Could Bring Cold, Snowy Weather to North America and Europe","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden stratospheric warming event in the stratosphere above the North Pole is weakening the polar vortex, which is expected to disrupt weather patterns across the Northern Hemisphere starting in early November 2025. This is especially concerning because such disruptions of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November.

   6:17 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  High above the North Pole, in a slice of atmosphere  rarely noticed and even less understood , a transformation is underway. Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat, and it could begin the week of Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/nigeria-christians-trump-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Nigerian Officials Meet US Leaders Amid Trump's Threats of Military Action Over Christian Violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigerian officials, led by National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, are meeting with key US officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in Washington, D.C., amid President Donald Trump’s threats of military action against Nigeria over violence against Christians.

would be designating Nigeria as a country of particular concern over conditions for Christians, saying Christianity is “facing an existential threat” and threatening US military action as a result.\n

They’re very clear, and it’s time to move on.”\n \n\n   \n  The preponderance of scientific evidence shows that vaccines do not cause autism, Singer said.\n \n\n   \n  “ No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines . This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Paul Offit agrees. In a  post on Substack  on Thursday, Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said scientific studies can “never prove never.”\n \n\n   \n  “If RFK Jr. wanted to be honest with the American public, he would make it clear on the CDC’s website that chicken nuggets also might cause autism, which has never been and will never be disproven,” Offit wrote.\n \n\n   \n  HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC’s website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on an episode of his  “Chasing Life” podcast  that he doesn’t think vaccines cause autism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s no medicine that’s 1,000% safe,” Makary said. “And I think we have to remember that with everything. I think the absolutism around some of this stuff creates mistrust. And when we say they’re 1,000% safe and it’s impossible for there to be a single complication of a vaccine, that’s the kind of rhetoric, I think, that doesn’t resonate well. So I think we have be humble and take a very honest approach.”\n \n\n   \n    Studies find no relationship\n \n\n   \n  Other bullets on the updated CDC page say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This too is not true: Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proved to be poorly done or were fraudulent. There are, however, many well-done, credible studies that find no such relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One of the  largest studies  looking at this question was published in 2019. Researchers in Denmark enrolled more than 650,000 children born between 1999 and 2011 and followed them from the time they were 1 year of age until the end of August 2013. Roughly 6,500 children were diagnosed with autism during the study period.\n \n\n   \n  When the researchers compared those who received the MMR vaccine with those who did not, they found no significant difference in the risk of developing autism. That held true whether the kids got other vaccines, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine; whether they had siblings with autism; or a host of other factors, such as whether certain kids might be prone to developing a form of regressive autism after getting their shots.\n \n\n   \n  “This study strongly supports that MMR vaccine does not increase the risk for autism,” the authors wrote in the conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  This study is not cited on the CDC’s updated “state of the evidence” on MMR vaccines, however. Instead, it mentions older evidence reviews and raises questions about aluminum, an ingredient added to some vaccines to boost their protection.\n \n\n   \n  The new CDC updates do mention another recent Danish study, published in 2025, which found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of 50 disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. But instead of accepting the overall conclusion of the study, the new CDC page tries to cast doubt on it by homing in on details of data in a supplementary table, saying the findings and other “warrant further investigation” into aluminum exposure and chronic diseases.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC page also says the US Department of Health and Human Services has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\n \n\n   \n  Singer said this is a waste of valuable research money and a distraction from strong science showing that most cases of autism can be traced to genes that affect a baby’s brain development.\n \n\n   \n  The main heading  on the page  states that “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but it has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”\n \n\n   \n  The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana,  during his confirmation process  that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy told CNN on Thursday that he had spoken with Kennedy.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted on X on Thursday, Cassidy said, “I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Dangerous health disinformation’\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Peter Hotez, who is director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and wrote a book called “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism” about his daughter’s diagnosis, said the updated information on the CDC’s page follows a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve decided they want to prove vaccines cause autism. So they keep making a series of assertions,” Hotez said, going back to debunked research that claimed the MMR vaccines caused autism and a retracted 2005 Rolling Stone article by Kennedy that asserted the preservative thimerosal caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  There have also been claims that aluminum in vaccines was a cause of autism, and those have been disproved, Hotez said.\n \n\n   \n  Hotez says the updates to the CDC’s page are “pure garbage.”\n \n\n   \n  “I consider it a piece of dangerous health disinformation, and it needs to be removed right away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on social media late Wednesday that the changes are “a national embarrassment.”\n \n\n   \n  “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Daskalakis said the agency’s scientists were completely blindsided by the page update.\n \n\n   \n  “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than restoring trust in America’s health agencies, moves like this have undermined it, said Dr. Sean O’ Leary, a pediatrician who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear that it’s going to lead to fewer children being vaccinated, children suffering from diseases they didn’t need to suffer from,” O’Leary said.\n \n\n   \n  This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter longstanding US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has hired longtime anti-vax allies – including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was  once disciplined  by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office – to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.\n \n\n   \n  The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. In a call with state health officials Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the US status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/chadwick-boseman-hollywood-walk-of-fame","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-05:00","title":"Chadwick Boseman honored with posthumous star on Hollywood Walk of Fame: ‘He was an incredible leader’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chadwick Boseman, the late actor celebrated for his roles in 'Black Panther' and 'Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,' was honored with a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on November 20, 2025.

5:37 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the 9-year-old had been absent for a prolonged time.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focusing on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska and closely examining the actions of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard was initially charged with a felony in an incident involving an unrelated different person, but the charge has since been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest and dismissal of false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.” Buzzard faced a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit.

hundreds of migrants arrested in Illinois just a day before they could have left detention \n       \n  By Whitney Wild, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:23 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal appeals court paused the  release of hundreds of immigrants  who were arrested during the Department of Homeland Security’s aggressive immigration actions in the Chicago area earlier this year, according to a court filing Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Last Wednesday, US District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the Trump administration to release on $1,500 bond hundreds of detainees after he determined the arrests violated a local consent decree barring warrantless arrests of immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  Court records showed last Friday the Department of Justice submitted a list of more than 600 people to be assessed for release. The list showed only a fraction of those detained were considered “high risk” by federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  The list included criminal histories for just 16 defendants. Those criminal histories included convictions or arrests for aggravated assault, driving under the influence, indecent exposure, battery and enticement of a minor and kidnapping.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of the DOJ filing showed migrants arrested in the Chicago area were transferred to detention facilities as far away as Texas and Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday sided with the Trump administration to keep those on the list in custody, just one day before detainees were set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions between the Trump administration and local leaders, protesters and journalists in Chicago and Illinois have boiled over since Operation Midway Blitz got underway over the summer. The government is fighting a multi-front legal battle as groups challenge agents’  use of force  on demonstrators, treatment of media and clergy, and warrantless detentions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal immigration crackdown has drawn pushback from community members concerned about the potential for racial profiling and  constitutional rights  violations – for both documented and undocumented people – as  the mass deportation agenda  has swept up people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests at  Home Depots  and farms, outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  In its request to pause the release of migrants, the Trump administration argued Judge Cummings’ orders in the case incorrectly interpreted the law, exceeded the scope of the consent decree and the court’s “legal and equitable authority” and infringed upon the immigration officers’ ability to operate.\n \n\n   \n  Though the appeals court did not explain why it sided with the Trump administration in the detention case, its decision comes just a day after a three-judge panel with the 7th Circuit blocked  a different judge’s order  because they believed the judge had overstepped their authority by imposing strict limits on how federal agents could operate in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In that ongoing case, US District Judge Sara Ellis responded to concerns from demonstrators, clergy and media about federal agents’ escalating crowd-control methods. Ellis prohibited agents from using several types of force, issued detailed requirements for body cameras and identification, and ordered the government to produce reams of internal records.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis called the Trump administration’s claims of rampant violence and obstruction in Chicago “not credible” in a written order released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants would have people believe instead that the Chicagoland area is in a vise hold of violence, ransacked by rioters, and attacked by agitators – which justifies the unprecedented swath of indiscriminate uses of force unleashed on journalists, peaceful protestors, and religious practitioners. That narrative simply is untrue.”\n \n\n   \n  Both cases under judges Cummings and Ellis are still ongoing. The 7th Circuit will hear oral arguments in the case on migrant detentions on December 2.\n \n\n   \n  The National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead attorneys in the class-action lawsuit, said they are “deeply disappointed” by Thursday’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The Seventh Circuit stay means that Chicago-area families will face, at minimum, weeks more separation, and people will continue to languish in inhumane immigrant detention centers, at risk of deportation without due process. This is especially sad given that families already have been separated from loved ones for weeks,” the organizations said in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  Even after Judge Cummings’ order paved the way for detainees’ release, the fate of those in custody remained unclear. Several of those arrested had filed their own individual cases, and some, according to the DOJ filing, were already released.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, according to Cummings’ ruling. The judge had ordered that those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple attorneys CNN spoke with were unsure how Cummings’ ruling would impact their clients who were transferred out of Judge Cummings’ jurisdiction.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:12:00Z","title":"Child Missing, Mother Refuses to Cooperate: What Happens Next?","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after being last seen with her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, during a cross-country road trip from California to Nebraska. The mother returned home without Melodee, did not report her missing, and has declined to cooperate with investigators. Surveillance footage shows both wearing wigs during the trip, with authorities suspecting wigs were changed to avoid recognition and the rental car’s license plate being altered to avoid detection. The FBI has joined the investigation, and the case has drawn widespread public attention. Ashlee Buzzard was briefly arrested on a false imprisonment charge, but it was dismissed due to lack of probable cause. Legal experts stress that law enforcement requires substantial evidence and probable cause before charging someone, especially in missing child cases.

What may happen next? \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:12 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after she was last seen with her mother wearing wigs on a cross-country road trip.\n \n\n   \n  The mother, Ashlee Buzzard, returned to their California home without Melodee, did not report her daughter missing and has declined to cooperate with law enforcement, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI has joined in the search for Melodee, and the case has drawn  widespread attention  well outside of Southern California. In all, the set of circumstances has raised serious red flags about Melodee’s well-being and about potential criminal wrongdoing for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Still, investigators have not charged Buzzard with a crime related to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  So, what gives?\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just not, ‘A kid’s missing. They haven’t been seen. Let’s arrest the mother,’” CNN legal analyst  Joey Jackson  said of how law enforcement operates. “What are the specific factual circumstances that would make the mother responsible?”\n \n\n   \n  “In any case, you need probable cause,” he added. “Is there reason to believe that a crime was committed and the subject of the person being arrested committed it?”\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke to several legal experts and re-examined other high-profile missing children cases to better understand the potential path forward in Melodee’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office, with assistance from the FBI, has been searching for Melodee and has publicly released some information from the “critical” time period of the road trip from October 7 to 10. Still, investigators may have more evidence that has not been released to the public, making it difficult to speculate on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re waiting for is evidence if she should be charged, and if so, with what,” Los Angeles’ Loyola Law School Professor  Laurie Levenson  said. “This one is still kind of a mystery. We know something is amiss: All of the wigs, the travel, the concerns that people are showing. I think those are legitimate that something is amiss, but we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Melodee went missing last month\n \n\n   \n  The search for Melodee began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the girl had been absent for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found, officials said. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts and “has been uncooperative” with investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts has focused on her and her mother’s movements during a 1,000-mile road trip from their home in Lompoc, California, to Nebraska. On October 7, Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from a rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing wigs on October 7, the sheriff’s office said. Further, the rental car’s license plate was changed midway through the trip in what the sheriff’s office said is believed to be an attempt “to avoid detection.”\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said in a November 6 statement . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  On November 7, the sheriff’s office  announced  the mother was arrested on a felony false imprisonment charge for allegedly using a box cutter and preventing an adult man “from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  She pleaded not guilty and was released from custody with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  The charge was dismissed and her pre-trial supervision ended on Thursday after the judge did not find sufficient probable cause, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office told CNN. The hearing featured testimony from the accuser, according to  CNN affiliate KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard’s attorney, Adrian Galvan, declined to comment to CNN about the investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday night Ashlee Buzzard was “in consistent contact with investigators and they have not had any additional information that they are prepared to release.”\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when the girl was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n    The next steps in the investigation\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are likely to continue tracing the steps of the road trip as they search for physical evidence, digital communications and witnesses, legal experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is what they should be doing,” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller explained. “They are taking their time. They are being meticulous. They are building the pieces of a case that may come together if and when they do have evidence to arrest her.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Buzzard, her uncooperative stance may be frustrating for investigators, but the Fifth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to silence in an interrogation.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no legal imperative at all, under any circumstance, no matter how bad things might look for you in public opinion, for you to say anything,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Other missing children cases\n \n\n   \n  In two high-profile cases involving missing children, the parents were initially charged with lesser counts as investigators continued to search for more evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Florida mother  Casey Anthony , for one, was initially charged with child neglect, providing false statements to police and obstruction in July 2008 in the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter  Caylee Anthony . The child had last been seen a month earlier and was reported missing by her grandparents.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, in October of that year, Anthony was indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The decomposed body of her daughter was found in December 2008.\n \n\n   \n  A jury ultimately acquitted her of murder but convicted her on four counts of providing false information to police.\n \n\n   \n  Or consider the case of the Idaho mother  Lori Vallow Daybell .\n \n\n   \n  Her children, JJ and Tylee, were last seen in September 2019, and relatives raised concerns about their whereabouts two months later. In  February 2020 , Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.\n \n\n   \n  The children’s bodies were found in June 2020, and Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were then indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Both were later  convicted  of  murder  in the children’s deaths.\n \n\n   \n  How Melodee’s case will play out remains a mystery.   In the near term, investigators’ focus will remain on finding her and her well-being.\n \n\n   \n  “There are so many open questions at this point,” Levenson said. “Right now, I think the priority is probably less the charges and more finding the kid.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/travel/real-id-tsa-fee","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:56:00-05:00","title":"Travelers without a REAL ID could be charged $18 by TSA under proposed rule","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is proposing a $18 non-refundable fee for travelers without a REAL ID to pass through airport checkpoints, as part of a broader effort to modernize identity verification using biometric kiosks.

California waters up to offshore oil drilling, breaking decades of precedent \n       \n  By Ella Nilsen, Steve Contorno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:13 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration is proposing to open federal waters off the entire coastline of California to drilling, as well as an area off the coast of Florida. Neither state’s waters have been open to new drilling for decades.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s Interior Department released a five-year offshore drilling plan on Thursday that would open up vast parts of California’s coastline to drilling, which hasn’t happened in that state since the late 1960s. The Department is also proposing new oil drilling in parts of the Eastern Gulf — located approximately 100 nautical miles off Florida’s coast — a decision opposed by Florida’s Republican leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s proposal would open the Eastern Gulf to federal oil drilling auctions starting in 2029. It would open auctions for drilling in central and southern California in 2027 and northern California in 2029.\n \n\n   \n  The oil industry has been advocating for opening up parts of the Eastern Gulf that are adjacent to areas where oil production has been happening for decades in the Central Gulf, an industry source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal is sure to be met with resistance in California. The state’s coast has not seen drilling since a devastating oil spill in 1969, which drew national attention for destroying coastal wildlife and the state’s fishing industry.\n \n\n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the plan “idiotic” in a statement and vowed the state “will use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s interesting that Donald’s proposal doesn’t include the waters off Mar-a-Lago,” Newsom said in his statement.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, Florida’s congressional delegation — including Republicans — repeatedly pushed back against attempts to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico to drilling. The first Trump administration extended the offshore drilling ban for the Eastern Gulf, rather than opening it up.\n \n\n   \n  This new Gulf action has also rankled many Florida Republicans, where memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill still shape public opinion. Molly Best, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said the governor’s office still supports the ban on drilling in the area from Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The DeSantis administration “urges the Department of Interior to reconsider,” Best said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  And a letter from several Florida Republican congressmen to the president urged the administration to withdraw the Eastern Gulf parcels, saying oil exploration there was “incompatible with military operations and recreational uses.” Among the signees is Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed candidate for governor in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Leading up to the release of Thursday’s five-year plan, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said he   believed he had assurances from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that any new drilling in the Gulf would not threaten Florida economically, environmentally or militarily, a source with knowledge of their conversation told CNN. A source close to several Republicans in Florida’s delegation told CNN officials believe the proposal honors those assurances, though congressional staff were still studying the details.\n \n\n   \n  National Ocean Industries Association president Erik Milito called the inclusion of the Eastern Gulf a “forward-looking approach” and American Petroleum Institute president Mike Sommers hailed it as a “historic step.”\n \n\n   \n  The move is part of President Donald Trump’s agenda to open up more parts of the country to drilling for fossil fuels — the oft-repeated campaign promise of “drill, baby, drill.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plan also proposes holding lease sales in the western and central Gulf of Mexico, where the vast majority of offshore drilling currently takes place. It also proposes auctioning off federal waters along almost all of Alaska’s coastline at the end of the decade and into the early 2030s.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Trump administration’s new plan, California leaders vowed to push back on the federal government’s move to open waters up to drilling, including possible legal action.\n \n\n   \n  “Time and again, President Trump has shown that his interest lies with his Big Oil friends profiting at the expense of our environment and public health,” said Christine Lee, a spokesperson for California attorney general Rob Bonta. “We won’t stand for this and are exploring our legal options.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Jared Huffman, both California Democrats, said in a joint statement that Trump’s plan “targets California and the whole West Coast because they think we will roll over.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are wrong,” Padilla and Huffman said. “We’re going to fight this with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  Given Trump’s tariffs, it’s not currently boom time for oil drilling, experts told CNN. Companies instead are trying to curb their spending and hold onto their earnings, said Tom Seng, a professor of energy finance at Texas Christian University.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the industry doesn’t have a lot going on,” Seng told CNN. “We certainly have a pro-fossil fuel administration. They’re going to streamline things for us, but the marketplace will always dictate activity.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Seng said, some oil exploration companies will likely want to “take advantage of the lease offerings,” with an eye towards the long-term future.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, when will they deploy the capital to actually drill on the leases?” he said. “There won’t be a rush to do so. $60 oil won’t help.”\n \n\n   \n  Environmental groups said the plan would pose a threat to marine life and oceanside communities around the country.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft plan is an oil spill nightmare,” said Oceana campaign director Joseph Gordon. “The last thing America needs now is a massive expansion of offshore drilling that could shut down our shores with catastrophic oil spills.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken in recent days and weeks to expand oil drilling around the country. The Interior Department this week announced it was rolling back a Biden-era rule that had banned fossil fuel drilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, over 13 million acres.\n \n\n   \n  And environmental groups sounded the alarm as oil company ConocoPhillips proposed more oil drilling exploration in Alaska, including drilling four new exploratory wells in the NPRA. The company is currently developing the massive Willow project in NPRA where it expects to start producing oil by 2029. Willow was approved by former President Joe Biden in a move that roiled the Democratic president’s base.\n \n\n   \n  “The public deserves the right to have a say on what happens on these critically important public lands in the Western Arctic,” Earthjustice attorney Ian Dooley said in a recent statement. “Seismic and drilling activities can cause impacts on this sensitive ecosystem that lasts decades.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/former-congressional-staffer-charged-allegedly-staging-assault","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:45:00-05:00","title":"Former Hill staffer charged for allegedly staging her own violent assault","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Natalie Greene, a former congressional staffer who worked in the office of GOP Rep.

New study casts doubt on universe’s accelerating expansion \n       \n  By Jacopo Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:48 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The universe’s expansion might not be accelerating but slowing down, a new study suggests.\n \n\n   \n   If confirmed, the finding would upend decades of established astronomical assumptions and rewrite our understanding of dark energy, the elusive force that counters the inward pull of gravity in our universe.\n \n\n   \n  Two separate teams of astronomers, while observing bright, exploding stars called Type 1a supernovas, put forth the idea in 1998   that dark energy might enable the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists had   noted that some of the most distant supernovas were dimmer than expected and concluded that they had moved away from Earth faster than anticipated. The discovery won them a  Nobel Prize in physics in 2011 .\n \n\n   \n  However, the nature of dark energy has remained a mystery, and its role in the universe’s expansion has been called into question  before .\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a consortium of hundreds of researchers using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)   in Arizona, developed the  largest ever 3D map  of the universe. The observations hinted at the fact that dark energy may be weakening over time, indicating that the universe’s rate of expansion could eventually slow.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a study  published  November 6   in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society provides further evidence that dark energy might not be pushing on the universe with the same strength it used to.\n \n\n   \n  The DESI project’s findings last year represented “a major, major paradigm change … and our result, in some sense, agrees well with that,” said Young-Wook Lee, a professor of astrophysics at Yonsei University in South Korea and lead researcher for the new study.\n \n\n   \n  Lee and his colleagues’ work builds on the evolving understanding of dark energy, suggesting that the universe’s expansion has already started to slow down — something that could alter the fate of the universe itself. “Dark energy is there, but the present universe has already entered a decelerating phase, today,” Lee said. “So the fate of the universe could change. And if you can change the fate of the universe, that is really important progress in cosmology.”\n \n\n   \n    Aging supernovas\n \n\n   \n  To reach their conclusions, the researchers analyzed a sample of 300 galaxies containing Type 1a supernovas and posited that the dimming of distant exploding stars was not only due to their moving farther away from Earth, but also due to the progenitor star’s age.\n \n\n   \n  “Before our work, Type Ia supernovae were thought to explode with nearly identical intrinsic brightness, making them highly reliable ‘standard candles,’” said study coauthor Junhyuk Son, a doctoral candidate of astronomy   at Yonsei University. “However, we found that their luminosity actually depends on the age of the stars that produce them — younger progenitors yield slightly dimmer supernovae, while older ones are brighter.”\n \n\n   \n  Son said the team has a high statistical confidence — 99.99% — about this age-brightness relation,  allowing them to use Type 1a supernovas more accurately than before to assess the universe’s expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “If confirmed, this would represent the most significant shift in cosmology since the discovery of dark energy in 1998,” Son said. “It would suggest that the (expansion of the) universe is no longer accelerating today and that dark energy is not a constant force but something that evolves over time. This discovery would open an entirely new chapter in our understanding of the physical nature of dark energy, how it has changed throughout cosmic history, and what it ultimately means for the fate of the universe.”\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, if the expansion continues to slow down, the universe could begin to contract, ending in what astronomers imagine may be the opposite of the big bang — the  big crunch . “That is certainly a possibility,” Lee said. “Even two years ago, the Big Crunch was out of the question. But we need more work to see whether it could actually happen.”\n \n\n   \n    Extraordinary claims\n \n\n   \n  The new research proposes a radical revision of accepted knowledge, so, understandably, it is being met with skepticism.\n \n\n   \n  ”This study rests on a flawed premise,” Adam Riess, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University and one of the recipients of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics, said in an email. “It suggests supernovae have aged with the Universe, yet observations show the opposite — today’s supernovae occur where young stars form. The same idea was proposed years ago and refuted then, and there appears to be nothing new in this version.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, however, said Riess’ claim is incorrect. “Even in the present-day Universe, Type Ia supernovae are found just as frequently in old, quiescent elliptical galaxies as in young, star-forming ones — which clearly shows that this comment is mistaken. The so-called paper that ‘refuted’ our earlier result relied on deeply flawed data with enormous uncertainties,” he said, adding that the age-brightness correlation has been independently confirmed by two separate teams in the United States and China.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts in the field who were not involved with the study echoed some of Riess’ concerns. Dan Scolnic, an associate professor of physics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, noted that the study makes a leap from host galaxy age to supernova age that isn’t physically justified. “The authors are proposing ideas that the community has already tested and corrected for with much larger data sets. The universe is still accelerating just fine,” Scolnic said.\n \n\n   \n  Dillon Brout, an assistant professor in the departments of astronomy and physics of Boston University, pointed out via email that the paper raises a fair question about how the ages of supernova progenitors change over cosmic time, adding that it is always important to challenge our way of thinking in order to a better understand of the universe. “However, the way they model that evolution is not supported by observations nor by our understanding of how these systems form. Modern supernova analyses already account for the connection between brightness and the environments where these stars originate, which captures most of the effect they discuss,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Dragan Huterer, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an email, noting that he does not feel the new research “rises to the threshold to overturn the currently favored model.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee is aware that the work might be controversial. “We have a long way to go to convince everyone in the supernova cosmology community,” he said. “There are still many people who are strongly against (our results), so a lot of debate and discussions should happen in the near future.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, more clarity on the issue might be around the corner. The new  Vera C. Rubin Observatory , which started operating this year, is set to help settle the debate with the early 2026 launch of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, an ultrawide and ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the universe made by scanning the entire sky every few nights over 10 years to capture a compilation of asteroids and comets, exploding stars, and distant galaxies as they change.\n \n\n   \n  “Vera Rubin will discover more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies with very high-precision age measurement,” Lee said. “It will take three or five years, and it will allow a more direct cosmological test without worrying about this age bias effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dark energy is getting weirder and weirder,” Lee concluded. “But there is no good theory that can explain this very weird behavior. So I think we are missing something. Maybe, in five years, an even more surprising result can come up.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/uk/uk-covid-inquiry-response-thousands-of-deaths-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00Z","title":"UK’s Covid response was ‘too little, too late’ and cost thousands of lives, inquiry says","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK's response to the coronavirus pandemic was criticized as 'too little, too late' by the head of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry, Baroness Heather Hallett, with findings indicating that delayed action and poor leadership led to thousands of avoidable deaths. Despite clear global warnings in February 2020, all four UK nations failed to act with urgency, resulting in a mandatory lockdown beginning on March 23, 2020. The inquiry estimates that introducing lockdown one week earlier could have saved at least 23,000 lives and reduced deaths in England by 48% by July 2020. Poor coordination between Westminster and devolved governments, coupled with political culture issues such as the 'Partygate' scandal involving former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, eroded public trust and increased non-compliance.

But, it was through their own acts and omissions that they had no choice,” said Baroness Heather Hallett, the inquiry’s chair.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, if the lockdown – which began on March 23, 2020 – had been introduced just a week earlier, at least 23,000 people would have survived, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  “The evidence suggests that the number of deaths in England alone in the first wave up until the 1st of July 2020, would have been reduced by 48%,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report, the second of 10 areas of investigation for the inquiry, was focused on how political leaders and senior officials made decisions during the pandemic. It examined the core machinery of government, the role of scientific advice, and the relationship between Westminster and the devolved nations as the crisis unfolded.\n \n\n   \n  Calling February 2020 a “lost month,” Hallett said: “The obviously escalating crisis required leadership from the very top. All four governments knew that in the reasonable worst case scenario, up to 80% of the population would be infected, with a very significant loss of life.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, rule-breaking politicians and their advisers weakened public confidence in government decisions and increased the likelihood that people would ignore restrictions, the report said, faulting all four UK nations for poor planning and decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  It said that strained relations and low trust between former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland made coordination difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s response throughout the crisis was criticized by many who said that he wasn’t taking the pandemic seriously enough.   The so-called “ Partygate ” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday, contributed to his departure as prime minister in July 2022.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a toxic and chaotic culture at the heart of the UK government …this kind of culture is detrimental to good decision making,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, which campaigned for an independent inquiry, said in a Thursday  statement  that “while it is vindicating to see Boris Johnson blamed in black and white for the catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic, it is devastating to think of the lives that could have been saved under a different prime minister.”\n \n\n   \n  “To make mistakes is human. To refuse to listen to frontline workers, vulnerable people, the insights of devolved leaders or scientific experts is unforgivable,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The report said that children were not given sufficient priority, as ministers did not fully account for the consequences of closing school and that overall, lockdown caused lasting societal harm and heightened existing inequalities.\n \n\n   \n  It did commend ministers for a successful vaccine rollout and for managing the exit from lockdown in early 2021 in a way that protected vulnerable groups.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report follows the inquiry’s initial report, published in July 2024, which delivered a stark assessment of the country’s pandemic preparedness.\n \n\n   \n  That report concluded that the UK entered the pandemic with “fatal strategic flaws” embedded in its emergency planning systems and found that government preparedness was focused almost entirely on influenza rather than respiratory viruses like Covid-19, despite international warnings.\n \n\n   \n  This narrow scenario planning meant that essential protections, such as robust PPE stockpiles, effective surveillance, and diverse expert input were all inadequate once the pandemic began, it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ten recommendations were issued, including a statutory body for emergency preparedness, regular national pandemic exercises, simplified crisis structures, and significantly improved data systems.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/inflation-polls-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Polls show Trump’s happy talk on inflation is falling flat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Polling data released in early November 2025 shows a significant gap between President Donald Trump’s claims of declining inflation and the public’s reality-based perception.

Trump set about falsely  claiming prices were actually down , that there is “almost no inflation,” and that everything was more or less hunky dory.\n \n\n   \n  It  was bizarre , even from a president who often seems to reside in his own elaborately crafted alternate reality.\n \n\n   \n  And it appears to be falling flat.\n \n\n   \n  New polling conducted since Trump began driving this message shows Americans continue to see things very differently than Trump has cast them. And their reviews of his economic stewardship appear to actually be getting worse.\n \n\n   \n    75% plus say grocery prices are up, despite Trump’s repeat claims\n \n\n   \n  “Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down,” Trump said November 6. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” he said at another point. He added last week that grocery prices were “already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”\n \n\n   \n  But just 12% of Americans said grocery prices have gone down over the last six months, according to a new  Marquette University Law School poll  conducted November 5 through 12.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, 75% said they’ve gone up.\n \n\n   \n  (Average grocery prices were indeed  up roughly 1.4%  in September compared to when  Trump took office in January, and the 0.6% jump in one month from July to August was the largest in three years.)\n \n\n   \n  Even among Republicans, only 2 in 10 subscribed to Trump’s alternate version of reality in which prices are actually dropping. A majority said prices are up.\n \n\n   \n  The numbers were similar in a Fox News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  That poll, conducted November 14 to 17, showed 85% of registered voters  said grocery prices are higher than a year ago, with 60% saying they’ve “increased a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  Around two-thirds or more also said the prices of utilities, healthcare and housing were up.\n \n\n   \n  (“A year ago” technically includes two months in which Trump was not yet president, but it stands to reason people perceived the question as being mostly about his tenure.)\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking: The percentage who say grocery prices are up “a lot” (60%) is significantly higher than the percentage who said that about groceries and everyday items back in October 2021 (43%). This despite inflation back then having been about double what it is today.\n \n\n   \n  That suggests this problem is really ingrained – and will be difficult for Trump to defeat with happy talk.\n \n\n   \n    The chasm between Trump’s claims and Americans’ views of inflation\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed there is “virtually no inflation,” “almost no inflation” and said inflation is “almost nonexistent.” He has also said “we don’t have any inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, inflation has remained stubborn throughout Trump’s tenure and is at about 3% on an annualized basis – right where it was when he took over.\n \n\n   \n  And the perception might be even worse.\n \n\n   \n  52% of registered voters  said inflation was “not at all” under control, according to the Fox poll. That includes nearly two-thirds of independents (65%).\n \n\n   \n  Fewer than 2 in 10 overall – and only one-third of Republicans – said inflation was at least “mostly” under control.\n \n\n   \n    Trump blames Joe Biden; the public doesn’t\n \n\n   \n  To the extent Trump has allowed that there are economic pains, he’s generally cast them as remnants of the Biden era.\n \n\n   \n  “Biden was a disaster with affordability,” Trump told Fox News shortly after the election. He added: “When I took over, it was a mess.”\n \n\n   \n  But this, too, appears to be a losing argument.\n \n\n   \n  The Fox News poll asked whether Trump or Biden were more responsible for the current economy, and voters  chose Trump, 62%-32%.\n \n\n   \n  Only around half of Republicans (53%) blamed Biden.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s numbers appear to be getting worse\n \n\n   \n  The gamble for Trump in pitching this alternate reality is evident: If people don’t ultimately subscribe to it, they might come to view Trump as out of touch and  not taking the problem seriously enough.\n \n\n   \n  Already,  CBS News-YouGov polling  has shown 75% of Americans and a majority of Republicans have said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices.\n \n\n   \n  And indeed, it seems Trump is doing himself no favors right now. If anything, his political picture on the economy and affordability is worsening:\n \n\n   \n  The same poll shows Americans say by about a 2-to-1 margin that they expected Trump’s policies will continue to increase inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Trump has given people plenty of reason to attach whatever happens with the economy to him. That’s what happens when you rock the economy with a series of unilateral global tariffs that weren’t even endorsed by Republicans in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump voluntarily took ownership of the economy. Now he wants to disclaim the reality of what’s followed.\n \n\n   \n  Political analysts love to mine Trump’s actions for secret political strategy and three-dimensional chess moves. But this seems more like desperation than anything else.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/soccer-ncaa-washington-huskies-mia-hamant","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Women’s college soccer team wins conference championship just 3 days after its beloved goalie died","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The University of Washington women’s soccer team won the Big Ten tournament championship just three days after the death of their beloved goalkeeper, Mia Hamant, who had been battling stage 4 kidney cancer.

     \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:35 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The aftermath of a  penalty shootout  is always emotional.\n \n\n   \n  One team will be joyfully exuberant, celebrating a victory wrought from the most nerve-wracking tension. That ecstasy will often be peppered with relief because things rarely go perfectly in a shootout. But for the other side, there is only dejection and heartbreak; it’s cruel to come so close to winning and lose.\n \n\n   \n  On November 9 in the Big Ten tournament championship game, it would have been hard to guess the result just from looking at the University of Washington’s  women’s soccer  players. They hugged each other tight, and some were weeping on their knees as they processed both a win and a loss: Just three days before the final, beloved goalkeeper Mia Hamant had died.\n \n\n   \n  Hamant had been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive form of stage 4 kidney cancer in April, upending her soccer dream for her senior season. But as she was tossed into a desperate fight for her life, Hamant remained an integral part of the team, both in the locker room and as their biggest cheerleader on the sidelines for home games. She was also ready to contribute on FaceTime when they were on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to perfectly describe her because Mia was Mia,” the Huskies head coach Nicole Van Dyke told  CNN Sports , adding: “If I didn’t start with her being an exceptional goalkeeper, she might be upset.”\n \n\n   \n  Last season, Hamant’s save percentage ranked her as one of the top three goalkeepers in the college game, but she was valued for so much more than her ability to stop shots.\n \n\n   \n  “She was strong, resilient, an exceptional teammate,” Van Dyke continued. “She was funny, she just regularly kept us laughing, she always brought people with her. She brought us so much joy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamant documented her fight against cancer on her Instagram page,  @miakickscancer , and she maintained regular contact with the coaches while helping develop some of the players in the team, particularly this season’s sophomore goalkeeper Tanner Ijams.\n \n\n   \n  “She was probably my biggest role model and definitely my biggest inspiration going into this season,” Ijams told CNN Sports. “You could just see how incredibly strong she was throughout all of this because you could tell how much pain she was in and we all knew that she was dealing with this insane battle of her life, and yet she was still laughing with us.”\n \n\n   \n  But on November 6, the laughter stopped. The Huskies had just beaten Wisconsin in their semifinal match when they learned that they had lost their friend and teammate.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something no one’s prepared for,” explained Van Dyke, “Fortunately, we were surrounded by friends and family, and I know that’s what Mia and Mia’s family wanted for us. To be together in that moment, we’re unbelievably grateful for that.”\n \n\n   \n  They all spent the next day together, united by grief as they tried to make sense of their loss without somebody who would usually be on hand to lift their spirits.\n \n\n   \n  On a team outing to Target, they bought pajamas and candles, and at Chick-fil-A, they drank milkshakes. The next day, on the eve of the final, the senior players were asked whether they should even take the field against Michigan State. The players looked quizzically at their coach, incredulous that they were even having the conversation, but she had to be sure: Was carrying on what they all wanted to do?\n \n\n   \n  “I know she would be up there making fun of us for being so sad,” Ijams recalled. “We knew that she would want us to go out in that finals match and crush them. So, that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  The players could sense Hamant everywhere around the stadium that day, they listened to her playlist in the locker room and they couldn’t help thinking of her when a sunset, which she so admired, glowed in the exact orange hue of the ribbons they’d been wearing in her honor all season. Orange is known as the color of kidney cancer awareness.\n \n\n   \n  Nobody could have known it at the time, but in what would be one of Hamant’s final games for the Huskies, she was the hero. In a quarterfinal match of the Big Ten tournament last season, Washington beat Iowa in a penalty shootout and Hamant made three saves. It seemed tragically poetic that in the first game after her passing, the match against Michigan State would also be settled with spot kicks, during which the goalkeepers play an outsized role in the proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  “Mia loved penalties, and I definitely share that love with her,” Ijams said. “She would have been absolutely thrilled to go to penalties.

images of engine separating during deadly UPS crash in Louisville \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, Pete Muntean, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:40 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A critical mount that kept the left engine attached to the  UPS flight that crashed  in Louisville earlier this month failed only moments after the doomed flight broke ground, according to a new report from the National Transportation Safety Board\n \n\n   \n  The report includes stunning frame-by-frame photos of the left engine of three-engined McDonnell Douglas MD-11F separating from the plane and going up and over the wing and igniting a fireball seen in a sequence of six extraordinary new images obtained by investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The three pilots of UPS flight 2976 and 11 people on the ground  were killed  when the beleaguered jet sliced a half-mile long debris field across a petroleum recycling facility and UPS warehouse, setting off a massive blaze of fire and black smoke visible for miles.\n \n\n   \n  The report highlights fatigue cracks found in the hardware attaching the engine to the wing and symptoms of over-stressing, but more is still to come as the agency conducts its full investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS freighter was a 34-year-old jet and had been in the process of being phased out by the cargo carrier.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Aviation Administration ultimately  grounded  all MD-11 and MD-11F aircraft until each underwent a thorough inspection. UPS has 26 other MD-11s in their fleet, a company spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The engine and other faulty parts\n \n\n   \n  Investigators who combed the runway shortly after the crash said they recovered and cleaned hardware from the scene—a pair structural fittings which kept the engine pylon snug to the wing. The fittings—known as lugs—showed signs of fatigue cracking and over-stressing, evidenced by “their 2 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions,” investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The report also lays out a new timeline of the crash sequence along with new data which showed the plane failed to climb higher than 30 feet above Runway 17 Right at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  A witness in the control tower reported the takeoff speed appeared normal for the type of aircraft, but the climb was not. Another witness said the plane stopped climbing and began to lose altitude before rolling to the left, the preliminary report said.\n \n\n   \n  The MD-11 is equipped with three engines: one on each wing and one on the tail. The plane went through some previous maintenance in San Antonio that put it out of commission for six weeks, investigators said. All service records will be reviewed.\n \n\n   \n  The left and right engines of the plane are attached to the underside of pylons that are attached to each wing.\n \n\n   \n    Investigators are still gathering more information\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have also been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorder contained two hours and four minutes of “good quality digitally recorded audio,” Inman previously said. The flight data recorder contained 63 hours of data that spanned over 24 flights, including the accident, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  In a rare move, the NTSB drew a parallel to a previous disaster—the 1979 crash of American Airlines Flight 191, in Chicago which killed 271 on board and two on the ground. The plane involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the forerunner to the MD-11.\n \n\n   \n  During that plane’s takeoff rotation, the left engine, pylon assembly and about three feet of the leading edge of the left wing separated from the plane and fell onto the runway. The plane rolled to the left and crashed.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple specialists in varying factors were deployed to investigate including experts   in air traffic control, human performance, aircraft performance and more.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the 12-pages of new findings were published just more than two weeks since the November 4 crash, significantly faster than the NTSB’s typical 30-day timeline to put out a preliminary report.\n \n\n   \n  “We appreciate the National Transportation Safety Board’s prompt release of preliminary findings and will fully support the investigation through its conclusion,” UPS said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Boeing, which long ago merged with the planes original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, said, “We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  A final report from the NTSB is expected in 18 to 24 months detailing the probable causes of the crash. The agency does not place blame, but gives further recommendations to improve safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Lauren Mascarenhas, Chris Isidore, Alaa Elassar, Devon M.

      2:16 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance on Thursday acknowledged that the Trump administration faces growing  skepticism over its economic record , issuing a plea for patience ahead of what he predicted would be an eventual “economic boom.”\n \n\n   \n  “We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do,” Vance said during a Breitbart News event. “As much progress as we’ve made, it’s going to take a little time for Americans to feel that.”\n \n\n   \n  The conciliatory tone represented a sharply different approach from the one taken in recent weeks by President Donald Trump, who has  continued to insist  that the economy is thriving while dismissing cost-of-living concerns as little more than a Democratic talking point.\n \n\n   \n  It also underscored the White House’s ongoing efforts to calibrate its messaging on the economy ahead of next year’s midterm elections — and in the  aftermath of GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginia   earlier this month that voters indicated were driven in large part by deep disappointment with Trump’s domestic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Vance during his remarks conceded that Americans remained unhappy over the affordability issues that have weighed on those approval ratings, such as the  price of groceries . At one point, he went as far as to undercut one of Trump’s key barometers of economic success — a decline in the price of eggs since January — by admitting that the food staple is still too expensive for many people.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an American who’s just struggling to get by, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you want your kids to have good opportunities. And then the price of eggs goes from $2 a dozen to $8 a dozen under the Biden administration, and then it goes from $8 a dozen to maybe $6.50 a dozen,” Vance said. “Well, to you that is still a major problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president sought to cast much of the blame for voters’ sour mood on former President Joe Biden, complaining that the prior administration had “put us in a very tough spot.” He also blamed Democrats for any near-term economic fallout from the record-long  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  “I do think that actually pumped the brakes a little bit on all the economic news that we’re seeing,” Vance said of the shutdown. “That’s going to cause a little bit of damage.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also celebrated a  stronger-than-expected September jobs report  released earlier on Thursday, calling it evidence that Trump’s policies were working.\n \n\n   \n  Yet he allowed that the Trump administration still has plenty of work to do to convince voters that those policies stand to benefit them, departing from the president’s preferred approach of touting his agenda as an unqualified success.\n \n\n   \n  At a US-Saudi Investment Forum a day earlier, Trump dismissed the focus on affordability, calling it a “new word” that Democrats have latched on to since he took office.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that we’re going up in is our stock market, okay, we’re bringing prices down,” Trump said, despite the rise in the cost of key products like  beef and coffee  that economists have blamed at least in part on the administration’s tariffs. “But they came up with a new word that they’re using: affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  The president in speeches and social media posts since Democrats’ electoral victories earlier this month has also called affordability concerns a “con job,” urging voters to credit him for falling gasoline prices and an inflation rate that’s come down from its Biden-era peak — but begun over the last several months to slowly climb once again.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has floated a range of initiatives aimed at reining in the cost of living despite Trump’s insistence that prices are falling, including rolling back tariffs on hundreds of products and raising the prospect of sending $2,000 checks to Americans at some point next year. Trump is  also expected to step up domestic travel  in the coming months focused on promoting his economic agenda, as aides try to boost voter awareness of the administration’s accomplishments.\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides are also planning to  pitch a new health reform plan  ahead of the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies amid GOP fears that the party will pay a hefty political price if voters’ health insurance costs skyrocket.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has offered few details about what that plan will look like. Though Vance on Thursday claimed the eventual proposal would get bipartisan support, he did not provide specifics.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also offered few new strategies for ushering in the booming economy that he said “we really do believe is coming,” arguing only that the administration needed a bit more time to realize its goals.\n \n\n   \n  “The thing I’d ask from the American people is to ask for a little bit of patience,” Vance said. “We just gotta keep it going.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/dick-cheney-funeral-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:55:00-05:00","title":"Bush, Biden and former vice presidents honor Dick Cheney, while Trump, Vance snubbed for funeral invitation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At a bipartisan funeral held at Washington’s National Cathedral, former Vice President Dick Cheney was honored by a wide array of political figures, including former presidents George W.

Vance said Thursday that the former vice president was “a guy who served his country,” and wished his family “all the best in this moment of grieving.” Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney received full military honors at the invitation-only memorial service at Washington’s National Cathedral. Former Presidents Joe Biden and George W. Bush and former first ladies Jill Biden and Laura Bush attended as well as former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle.\n \n\n   \n  Bush eulogized his former vice president as a consummate public servant who could be relied on, and who “lifted the standards” of those around him.\n \n\n   \n  “His abilities were self-evident, without need of calculation or self-promotion,” Bush said. “His talent and restraint exceeded his ego.”\n \n\n   \n  The former president recalled that Cheney was initially tapped to help him find a running mate during his 2000 presidential run. But after going over the list of names, Bush said he came to realize that Cheney himself was the best man for the job.\n \n\n   \n  The former president said Cheney rattled off a list of reasons why he should not serve as his running mate when Bush approached him with the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “I told him that, at such a moment, most in his position would have jumped at the chance, but Dick stayed detached and he analyzed it before I made my decision,” Bush said. “He insisted on giving me a complete rundown of all of the reasons I should not choose him.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney would go on to serve two terms with Bush, becoming one of the most influential and powerful vice presidents in modern history.\n \n\n   \n  Also in attendance at the memorial service were a number of Supreme Court Justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. A large number of past and present Cabinet members from both Republican and Democratic administrations were also expected, as well as congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi was present along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former leader Mitch McConnell.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, who served as Bush’s vice president from 2001 to 2009, died on November 3 at the age of 84. Prior to being elected vice president, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and as a congressman representing Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n  He was further remembered for his progressive stance on several social issues, including gay marriage, but his role as the architect of the Iraq War saw him leave office  deeply unpopular  and cemented a polarizing legacy.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Williams, who worked as Pentagon press secretary during Cheney’s time as defense secretary, recalled offering to resign from his position after a magazine outed him as gay in 1991.\n \n\n   \n  “He wouldn’t hear of it, and for several days after that article appeared, he would call me on the direct line to my desk at the Pentagon to ask how I was doing and to tell me to get on with the job,” Williams said.\n \n\n   \n  While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was a lifetime hardline conservative who endorsed Trump’s 2016 campaign. But he spent the last years of his life speaking out against Trump, particularly after his daughter then-Rep. Liz Cheney drew the president’s ire for her prominent role in a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021,  insurrection at the Capitol .\n \n\n   \n  Liz Cheney made a reference to her father’s decision to support Harris over Trump last year. “For him,” she said, “a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.”\n \n\n   \n  The funeral’s guest list itself was also a nod to a time when Washington was not so polarized and politicians from both sides of the aisle paid their respects when a dignitary passed away.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Cheney  described Trump as a coward  and said no one was a “greater threat to our republic.”\n \n\n   \n  Pence, who similarly broke with Trump over the president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said that Cheney gave him two pieces of advice shortly after Pence was elected vice president in 2016. He urged Pence to spend “a lot of time on Capitol Hill” and to receive the president’s daily brief first thing in the morning, before attending any meeting with the president, in order to be better prepared for what would be discussed.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what’s coming and can run that through the filter of the president’s priorities,’” Pence told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny before the funeral.\n \n\n   \n  The White House offered a muted reaction after Cheney’s death with press secretary Karoline Leavitt telling reporters that Trump was “aware” the former vice president had died and noting that flags had been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Trump not being invited to the funeral, which  Axios  was first to report.\n \n\n   \n  Honorary pallbearers at Cheney’s funeral included members of his Secret Service detail; his former chiefs of staff, David Addington and Scooter Libby; and photographer David Hume Kennerly.\n \n\n   \n  On one of the last pages of the service leaflet was a quote from the writer and naturalist John Muir, saying: “The mountains are calling and I must go.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/tech/trump-eo-block-state-ai-regulations-safety-concerns","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump renews effort to block states from regulating AI, raising alarms about safety","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order to block state-level regulations on artificial intelligence, establishing an AI Litigation Task Force to preempt such laws.

    12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order that would block states from enforcing regulations around artificial intelligence, renewing an AI deregulation push that’s raising concerns among tech safety advocates and state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  The draft order directs the US attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws and preempt them with Trump’s more lax federal policy, according to a copy viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving technology is already subject to little oversight as it extends into more areas of life — from personal communications and relationships to health care and policing. In the absence of broad federal legislation, some states have passed laws to address potentially risky and harmful uses of AI, such as the creation of misleading deepfakes and algorithmic discrimination in hiring. Critics of the preemption push worry that if left unchecked, AI companies could evade accountability should their tools harm consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for comment about the pushback, a White House official told CNN that until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential orders is speculation.\n \n\n   \n  The language in Trump’s draft order mirrors the argument from some in the tech industry, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, that navigating a patchwork of state laws would slow down innovation and could affect America’s competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome, uniform national policy framework for AI,” the draft order states.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also suggested adding language blocking state AI regulations to the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual defense policy bill, in a Tuesday  post  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Congress killed an earlier attempt by Republicans to prevent states from regulating AI in July. The US Senate voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill before the bill passed. Weeks later, the Trump administration released a Silicon Valley-friendly  AI action plan , a package of initiatives and policy recommendations that largely centered on scaling back AI regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  While some in Silicon Valley may support easing up on AI regulation, the proposal has received broad pushback as concerns about AI safety have escalated in recent months. A growing  string of reports  have highlighted risks of the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Meta have also been scrambling to  block young people  from accessing adult content via AI systems.\n \n\n   \n  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the effort “federal government overreach” in a Tuesday  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Stripping states of jurisdiction to regulate AI is a subsidy to Big Tech and will prevent states from protecting against online censorship of political speech, predatory applications that target children, violations of intellectual property rights and data center intrusions on power/water resources,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Senator Ed Markey called out Republicans for “trying to sneak their AI regulation moratorium into the defense bill” and accused Trump of siding “with his billionaire Big Tech buddies,” in an X  post  Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The renewed preemption push comes as Trump hosted a dinner at the White House this week for business leaders, which was attended by many AI industry leaders, including Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and tech investor and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of organizations — including tech employee unions and other labor groups, tech safety and consumer protection nonprofits and educational institutions —  signed   letters to Congress  this week opposing the idea of blocking state AI regulations and raising alarms about AI safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft executive order isn’t about interstate commerce or American competitiveness,” Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, vice president of The Leadership Conference’s Center for Civil Rights and Technology, said in a statement. “It’s about giving the administration’s tech billionaire buddies and corporations a free pass rather than protecting the people it’s meant to serve.”\n \n\n   \n  J.B. Branch, big tech accountability advocate at the consumer protection nonprofit Public Citizen, noted in a statement that “AI scams are exploding, children have died by suicide linked to harmful online systems, and psychologists are warning about AI-induced breakdowns” and that blocking state regulations could “shield Silicon Valley from responsibility.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/hunger-games-sunrise-first-look","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Our first look at ‘The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping’ is already a wild ride","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The teaser trailer for 'The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping' has been released, marking the beginning of a prequel film that explores the origin story of Haymitch Abernathy, 24 years before the original events.

\nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel’s forced removal of tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the  occupied West Bank  earlier this year amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged.\n \n\n   \n  According to a 105-page report released by the non-profit organization, 32,000 Palestinians were expelled by Israeli forces from three camps in January and February, while international attention was focused on  Israel’s war in Gaza , and they have not been allowed to return.\n \n\n   \n  As part of its research, HRW said it interviewed 31 displaced Palestinian refugees from Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery and Israeli military demolition orders, as well as verified video and images of Israeli military operations.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN in a statement that the military launched what it called Operation “Iron Wall” in the three camps ten months ago “in light of the security threats posed by these camps and the growing presence of terrorist elements within them.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it destroyed “rows of buildings” to create “new access routes inside the camps.” The military said the decision to demolish the buildings “was made based on operational necessity, with careful consideration and only after alternative options to achieve the same military advantage were examined.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said the “demolitions were conducted lawfully, based on military necessity and with the required proportionality” and that “terrorism in Judea and Samaria has decreased by 70%” since the start of the operation, using the biblical term for the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The HRW report claims that Israel stormed Jenin refugee camp on January 21, with Apache helicopters, drones, bulldozers, and armored vehicles carrying ground forces, to oust the Palestinians living there.\n \n\n   \n  Similar operations were carried out at Tulkaram on January 27, and Nur Shams on February 9.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli soldiers “were yelling and throwing things everywhere…. It was like a movie scene – some had masks and they were carrying all kinds of weapons,” one 54-year-old woman told HRW.\n \n\n   \n  The displaced Palestinians have not been permitted to return home, the report found, adding that Israeli soldiers fired upon those who did attempt to re-enter. Only a few have been allowed to collect their belongings, it said, while HRW analysis of satellite imagery six months on found that more than 850 homes and other buildings had been damaged or destroyed across the camps.\n \n\n   \n  No shelter or humanitarian assistance was offered to displaced residents by the Israeli military, the report found. Instead, people were left to fend for themselves, seeking shelter wherever they could, including crowding into the homes of relatives or friends, or arriving at mosques or local charities.\n \n\n   \n  All three camps date back to the early 1950s, when they were established by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to house Palestinians who were expelled from their homes or forced to flee following Israel’s creation in 1948. Those refugees and their descendants had resided there ever since.\n \n\n   \n  “Israeli authorities in early 2025 forcibly removed 32,000 Palestinians from their homes in West Bank refugee camps without regard to international legal protections and have not permitted them to return,” Nadia Hardman, a senior migrant rights researcher at HRW, said.\n \n\n   \n  “With global attention focused on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing in the West Bank that should be investigated and prosecuted.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has intensified operations across the West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing checkpoints, and cutting communities off from the outside world.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been an escalation in Israeli settler attacks and land grabs in the territory. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law.\n \n\n   \n  HRW is now calling for senior Israeli officials to be investigated over the expulsions, including Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, the Central Command commander who oversaw West Bank military operations.\n \n\n   \n  Where found responsible, they should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the organization said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5617227","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00-05:00","title":"After Break with Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene Will Resign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and one of President Trump’s most prominent defenders, has announced her resignation from Congress, effective January 5, 2026.

       \n           Updated Friday, November 21, 2025 • 10:08 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who rose to prominence as one of President Trump's biggest defenders and recently became one of his biggest critics, is leaving Congress. In a nearly  11-minute video statement , Greene excoriated the Republican Party, House leadership and the start of campaign season \"which means all courage leaves and only safe campaign re-election mode is turned on.\" Greene's announcement late Friday that she would resign effective Jan. 5, 2026, is the  latest escalation  of months of clashes with the president over his second term agenda – including the release of the Epstein files. \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's campaign promise to release files related to the life and death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – and the numerous ways the president stonewalled the release this year before ultimately relenting this week – was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. The third-term congresswoman also said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\" \"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife,' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\" Greene is  one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators  who have indicated they do not plan to return to their seats after the 2026 election, joining a number of lawmakers who are retiring or running for a different office. Her resignation will likely set up a special election to finish the rest of her term in the spring. The  fracturing of Trump's MAGA coalition  has been developing for months, with splits over foreign policy issues like bombing Iran and the support of Israel's war in Gaza accompanying questions about domestic effects of tariffs. Greene has been a vocal opponent each time.  Greene has remained ideologically consistent throughout her time in Congress and with her criticism of Trump. Her argument is that the president and the Republican Party have changed and fallen short of the Make America Great Again and America First vision. Notably, her announcement video also blasted the \"political industrial complex of both political parties\" that focuses on which side \"can convince Americans to hate the other side more.\"  \"And the results are always the same, no matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat,\" she said. \"Nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.\" Greene's retirement announcement comes at a time when the Republican Party – and Trump – are facing a number of setbacks, including defeats up and down the ballot in this month's elections and poor economic headwinds. Now, there is a large and visible dent in the previously impenetrable armor that is Trump's control over the party and its future, accelerating the inevitable questions around what a post-Trump GOP would look like. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is leaving Congress. The Georgia Republican rose to prominence as one of President Trump's biggest defenders and more recently became one of his biggest critics. Greene announced late Friday she would resign her seat, effective January 5, 2026. It is the latest development in months of clashes with the president over his second-term agenda. NPR's Stephen Fowler had been covering that rift and is here to talk about the breaking news, Hey, Stephen. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. DETROW: There is an 11-minute video that Greene posted online tonight detailing her decision to leave Congress. What does she have to say? FOWLER: There's a lot in here. I mean, it's equal parts excoriation of how she says Trump has abandoned America First ideology, the dysfunction of the House and a pretty impassioned defense of her choices and time in office and the attacks that she's been on the receiving end of lately. She mentioned all the things she did for Trump and Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: With that has brought years of nonstop, neverending personal attacks - death threats, lawfare, ridiculous slander and lies about me that most people could never withstand, even for a single day. FOWLER: She also said, quote, \"I refuse to be a battered wife, hoping it all goes away and gets better.\" DETROW: So there's been tension with some of the policies of this term. There's been a lot of tension and frustration with Congress, and I mean, she's not alone on that front. But is this decision all about Epstein, in the end? - the files, the fight over that. FOWLER: Well, it is, but it's also worth noting that it's because this split has been a long time coming. Marjorie Taylor Greene has been at the forefront of criticisms this year of Republicans who haven't always agreed with Trump 2.0 policy planks. On the foreign policy front, that includes the bombing of Iran in support of Israel's war in Gaza. Domestically, there's been rifts over some of the tariff policies and the subsequent walk backs the administration has done. Marjorie Taylor Greene's argument has been, she has stayed true to what Make America Great Again and America First means, and that Trump, even though he started those movements, is no longer fully in touch with the movements. Then there's the Epstein files. Trump's campaign promised to release them, and subsequent stonewalling and walking back was another example of how there was this disconnect, and that turned quite nasty and personal. Here's another thing Greene said in her video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREENE: Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for. DETROW: Stephen, this is going to be about halfway through a two-year term. What is it about Congress that has Greene leaving in the middle of it? FOWLER: Well, there's also a soundbite for that, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREENE: I do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president that we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms. FOWLER: Greene was an advocate of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy when he faced a revolt from a narrow Republican majority, then helped oust him, and she also hasn't had a great relationship with current House Speaker Mike Johnson. She's also one of many Republicans who criticized the House staying out of session during the longest ever government shutdown, and she decried the, quote, \"political industrial complex\" of both major parties that, she says, focused on convincing Americans to hate the other side more. I want to put this in a greater context, too. Greene is one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators, mostly Republicans, who say they're not planning to return to their seats after the 2026 election. DETROW: That is NPR's Stephen Fowler. Stephen, thank you for covering this breaking news for us. FOWLER: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/football-nfl-week-12-five-things","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00.000-05:00","title":"Shedeur starts, the Chiefs need a win and the Bengals can’t catch a break: 5 things to know about NFL Week 12","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 12 of the NFL season brings a mix of high-stakes matchups, injury uncertainties, and defensive struggles.

Shedeur starts, the Chiefs need a win and the Bengals can’t catch a break: 5 things to know about NFL Week 12 \n       \n  By Andy Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Week 12 of the  NFL  season brings about a big game for Patrick Mahomes and Co., injury intrigue and a sneakily important  Monday Night Football  game.\n \n\n   \n  From Shedeur Sanders starting for the Cleveland Browns to the Cincinnati Bengals never seeming to catch a break, here are five things to know about Week 12.\n \n\n   \n    Rodgers’ wrist clouds Steelers’ week\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers fans can breathe – at least a little. Head coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that Aaron Rodgers will not need surgery on the fracture in his left, non-throwing wrist. Whether he actually plays Sunday in Chicago? Still a coin flip.\n \n\n   \n  The 41-year-old’s practice status on Friday will likely decide everything. Rodgers said his ability to protect himself is going to be the deciding factor, not pain management.\n \n\n   \n  And make no mistake: Rodgers would love nothing more than another crack at the Bears. During his Packers days, he saw them twice a year and went 24-5 against Chicago, famously telling fans – multiple times – that he “owns” the Bears.\n \n\n   \n  If Rodgers can’t go, Mason Rudolph is expected to step in.\n \n\n   \n    Bengals defense reaches historic lows\n \n\n   \n   Joe Burrow  could return on Thanksgiving night against the Baltimore Ravens – but the Bengals may already be out of runway.\n \n\n   \n  At 3-7, Cincinnati can’t afford another slip if it wants any shot at the postseason. The defense, in particular, has put them in a historic hole. The Bengals have allowed 27 or more points in each of the last nine games, becoming the first team in NFL history to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Now, they get a New England Patriots team that’s quietly rolling. Rookie quarterback Drake Maye leads the NFL with 2,836 passing yards, and here’s the wild part: He hasn’t had a single 300-yard game. No explosions – just relentless, efficient production every week.\n \n\n   \n  The Patriots are 9-2 and suddenly staring at a possible No. 1 seed if they keep stacking wins.\n \n\n   \n    Chiefs-Colts: A season-defining test\n \n\n   \n  The AFC’s game of the week features the 5-5 Chiefs hosting the 8-2 Indianapolis Colts, and nothing about Kansas City’s season has gone the way anyone expected.\n \n\n   \n  A year after going 11-0 in one-score games, the Chiefs are 0-5 in those same situations this season. The late-game Mahomes magic just hasn’t shown up. The three-time Super Bowl winner has bluntly put the blame on himself: “We haven’t been consistent enough to win games. It starts with me.”\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming the Chiefs’ starter, Mahomes has never failed to reach at least the AFC Championship Game. A loss on Sunday would drop Kansas City to 5-6, and the margin for error the rest of the way becomes razor-thin.\n \n\n   \n    Another week, another Browns QB\n \n\n   \n  The more things change, the more they stay the same: A new QB is going to be under center in Cleveland. The Browns are turning to rookie Shedeur Sanders on Sunday in Las Vegas, making him the 42nd starting quarterback the franchise has used since returning in 1999 – a staggering reminder of the instability that has defined the position in Cleveland for over 25 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sanders was thrown into the fire last week against the Ravens after Dillon Gabriel exited with a concussion, and the results were rough. The rookie finished just 4-of-16 for 47 yards and an interception, struggling to find any rhythm against a tough Baltimor defense.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he gets his first full start – and his first real opportunity to rewrite the narrative.\n \n\n   \n  For Sanders, it’s a chance to show the Raiders, and every team that passed on him in the draft (which is all other 31 franchises considering he was selected with the 155th pick in the 4th round), that they misjudged him. For the Browns, it’s yet another hope that maybe this time they’ve found a spark.\n \n\n   \n    Niners-Panthers take the MNF stage\n \n\n   \n  Monday Night Football brings a sneaky-important NFC matchup: the 7-4 San Francisco 49ers hosting the 6-5 Carolina Panthers.\n \n\n   \n  Brock Purdy returned from his toe injury last week and hardly missed a beat, throwing 19-of-26 for 200 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-22 win over Arizona. With the NFC wild card picture tightening, this one carries real postseason weight.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco’s path is tougher – the NFC West has been the best division in football with the Los Angeles Rams (8-2), Seattle Seahawks (7-3), and Niners (7-4) all above water.\n \n\n   \n  The Panthers are coming off a huge overtime win in Atlanta that saw Bryce Young throw for a career-high 448 yards. He could be in for another big game as the Niners’ banged up secondary gives up the  fifth-most passing yards per game  in the league.\n \n\n   \n  And here’s your weird stat of the week: the Panthers are 6-0 when winning the coin toss and 0-5 when losing it. So, we may know how this one goes before the ball ever leaves the tee.\n \n\n   \n    Full NFL Week 12 schedule\n \n\n   \n   Away @ home \n \n\n   \n   Thursday \n \n\n   \n  Buffalo Bills @ Houston Texans, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Sunday \n \n\n   \n  Indianapolis Colts @ Kansas City Chiefs, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Seattle Seahawks @ Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Jets @ Baltimore Ravens, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Giants @ Detroit Lions, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers @ Chicago Bears, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Cleveland Browns @ Las Vegas Raiders, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville Jaguras @ Arizona Cardinals, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Philadelphia Eagles @ Dallas Cowboys, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Los Angeles Rams, 8:20 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Monday \n \n\n   \n  Carolina Panthers @ San Francisco 49ers, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615169","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:38:00.000Z","title":"Trump and Mamdani Share a Cordial White House Meeting After Months of Trading Attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant shift from months of hostility, President Donald Trump and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a cordial and productive face-to-face meeting at the White House, marking a rare moment of political détente.

The White House sit-down on Friday marked a stark contrast for the two leaders. Trump has repeatedly sought to paint Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, as too extreme for the city that he long called home. In the president's announcement of the meeting on Truth Social earlier this week, Trump called Mamdani a \"communist.\" However, speaking to reporters after  the meeting in the Oval Office , that antipathy was nowhere to be found. Trump praised Mamdani's campaign and pledged to work with him on shared policy concerns centered on the cost of living and reducing crime. \"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see – really wants to see – New York be great again,\" said Trump, who was born in Queens, N.Y., the same borough that Mamdani partially represented in the State Assembly. \"I'll be cheering for him.\" Mamdani had previously called Trump a \"despot,\" but standing to his side on Friday he echoed the president's interest in cooperating around shared goals. \"I enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to working together to deliver that affordability for New Yorkers,\" he said. Over the course of just months, Mamdani's candidacy for mayor turned from a long-shot bid to a national movement, sparking interest  far beyond New York  in his progressive ideas, including freezing rent in rent-stabilized units, making city buses free and opening city-run grocery stores. It's a platform that quickly caught the ire of many conservative leaders, notably Trump, who made no secret of his opposition to Mamdani following his  upset win  in June's Democratic primary. In the lead-up to Election Day, Trump said he would arrest Mamdani if he disrupted ICE operations in the city, and falsely suggested that Mamdani — a naturalized citizen — was living in the country illegally. At one point, he threatened to pull the city's federal funding were Mamdani to win. He also endorsed Mamdani's rival in the race, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But over the course of his public appearance with Mamdani, Trump told reporters he was surprised by several broad areas of agreement.  \"He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down, all things that I agree with,\" Trump said, while acknowledging that the two leaders \"may disagree how we get there.\" While it's unclear if the meeting will lead to a lasting working relationship, Friday's meeting seemed to signal at least a temporary break from the past rhetoric that defined their relationship.  Trump rose to Mamdani's defense on multiple occasions while speaking to reporters, declining to agree with  conservative attacks  calling Mamdani a \"jihadist,\" and saying he would feel comfortable living in New York City under a Mamdani administration. \"We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,\" Trump explained. \"I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job.\" The president also made light of Mamdani's past comments, where he referred to the president as a \"fascist.\" When reporters asked Mamdani to confirm, Trump interrupted and brushed off the label, telling the incoming mayor, \"That's okay. You can just say yes.\" \"It's easier than explaining it,\" Trump added. \"I don't mind.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Just weeks after being elected the next mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani is meeting President Trump at the White House. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The 34-year-old democratic socialist quickly became a national figure after an upset primary win earlier this year. He's got a lot of fans, particularly among young voters and progressives. But he's also become a foe for many on the right, including President Trump. MARTÍNEZ: NPR political reporter Elena Moore will be covering that meeting. Elena, this is one of these meetings where I did not expect these two in the same room together. ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Yeah, I mean, it's actually a tradition for the incoming mayor-elect to sit down with the president. Also, New York is an important place. It's the biggest city in the country and President Trump's hometown. He's from Queens, the same borough that Zohran Mamdani represents in the State Assembly right now. But despite that connection, A, Trump has been a vocal critic of Mamdani. Ahead of election day, he went as far as to endorse Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York who was running against Mamdani. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, and they seem like political polar opposites. So I can kind of see why Trump would be riled up by the new mayor. MOORE: Well, yeah. Mamdani ran on the Democratic ticket, but he identifies as a democratic socialist. And he's made some ambitious campaign promises aimed at tackling the rising cost of living, like freezing the rent for rent-stabilized apartments and creating city-run grocery stores. But his ideas are also ones that conservatives have painted as radical and extreme, and Trump has really taken that up a notch. He's repeatedly called Mamdani a communist. He said he'd arrest him if he didn't cooperate with ICE raids as mayor and suggested that Mamdani isn't living in the country legally even though, A, he's a naturalized citizen. MARTÍNEZ: And what's been Mamdani's response to Trump? MOORE: He's largely stood his ground. I mean, Mamdani made a point even to address the president directly in his victory speech, looking into the camera and telling Trump to turn the volume up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZOHRAN MAMDANI: Hear me, President Trump, when I say this. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us. (CHEERING) MOORE: Part of what makes Mamdani so impactful right now is that he's built a large movement, one that a lot of longtime Democrats just don't have at the moment. In the lead-up to election day, I talked to voters around the country who said they've been feeling increasingly disappointed by the Democratic Party in recent years but see Mamdani as a welcome change. So he is popular. And that's why, you know, partly, Trump is paying attention. MARTÍNEZ: So what are they going to talk about? New York Knicks basketball? MOORE: (Laughter) I wish. I mean, speaking to reporters yesterday, Mamdani said that even though he disagrees with Trump a lot, he's willing to work with anyone who wants to make life more affordable for New Yorkers. And as a reminder, I mean, Trump vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won. So there are real stakes here. But this isn't just about the dollars. You know, this meeting is a reminder of the big shift that Mamdani has to make in these next few weeks as he takes on this job. He's got a background as an activist, but being mayor of New York City is a totally different role. So today, it may be a test for him, you know, on balancing the policy priorities that got him elected and maintaining the political diplomacy required as mayor. MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR political reporter Elena Moore. Thanks a lot. MOORE: Thank you.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for what he says are \"millions in lost revenue, luxury spending, and preferential treatment for Trump allies.\" The committee's ranking member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) sent a letter outlining the claims to Kennedy Center president, Richard Grenell. Grenell denied the allegations in a letter that was  posted  to the Kennedy Center's social media. The Kennedy Center's building is maintained by the federal government, though its programming and staff are supported by a combination of private and federal funds. Whitehouse's letter, plus documentation obtained by Democrats on the Senate committee, are  posted on its website . The documents appear to show that non-arts groups are getting significant discounts on rental fees at the Kennedy Center. There is a copy of a contract with FIFA that shows the international soccer organization will not pay the usual $5 million in rental fees when it takes over the center for three weeks in order to announce next year's World Cup draw, as first  reported  by  The Washington Post . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Senate Democrats obtained copies of contracts given to Grenell's friends and associates, worth tens of thousands of dollars. In his letter to Grenell, Whitehouse said these and other actions show a \"profound disregard\" for leadership's \"fiduciary responsibility.\" Allegations of financial mismanagement come at a time of  declining  audiences, artist  cancellations ,  layoffs  and resignations at the Kennedy Center. An  analysis  by  The Washington Post  found that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have taken a nosedive; on average, 43% of tickets have not been sold since early September. On the same day as the  Post 's reporting, Grenell  announced  the center had raised \"a record-breaking\" $58 million from donors and sponsors in 30 days \"with more on the horizon.\" In his response to Whitehouse, Grenell  wrote  that he is \"concerned about your careless attacks on me and my team\" and that the Senator's letter is \"filled with partisan attacks and false accusations.\" Grenell denied Whitehouse's claims and alleged financial mismanagement by the center's previous leadership, including \"a bloated staff\" and \"deferred maintenance\" that \"was quite literally making the building fall apart.\" President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act  includes  $257 million for repairs, maintenance and restoration of the Kennedy Center. Addressing the claim that FIFA will be using the center for free, instead of paying a $5 million rental fee to the Kennedy Center, Grenell said the international soccer organization has \"given us several million dollars, in addition to paying all of the expenses for this event in lieu of a rental fee.…A simple rental fee would not have been enough to cover the magnitude of the event.\" Grenell has slammed previous Kennedy Center leadership a number of times. In this week's letter to Whitehouse, he wrote that \"for the first time in decades, we have a balanced budget at the Kennedy Center.\" In May he  told  the Kennedy Center board the \"deferred maintenance of the Kennedy Center is criminal.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Former Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter and board chair David Rubenstein  rejected  Grenell's characterization of their work. Rutter wrote, \"Perhaps those now in charge are facing significant financial gaps and are seeking to attribute them to past management.\" In a statement to NPR from May, Rubenstein said, \"financial reports were reviewed and approved by the Kennedy Center's audit committee and full board as well as a major accounting firm.\" That audit committee included board members appointed by Trump during his first term,  including  U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was a special advisor to Trump and worked on his defense team during his Senate impeachment trial. Whitehouse is requesting the Kennedy Center supply him with \"documents and information about the Center's financial management practices, expenditures, donors, and contracts under Grenell's leadership by December 4, 2025.\" This story was edited by Jennifer Vanasco. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5613873","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-05:00","title":"Do You Want Out of The Cult of Homeownership?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article critiques the proposed 50-year mortgage plan by the FHFA, arguing it is a superficial fix that increases long-term debt and interest, undermining true affordability.

Episode Highlights Whether 50-year mortgages are a solution \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       HORSLEY: The 50-year mortgage is sort of a superficial way to try to make homeownership seem more affordable. But if you scrape just a smidge below the surface, there's not a lot of substance here. Housing affordability is a real challenge. A 50-year mortgage is not a real solution. It would have the effect, potentially, of lowering people's monthly payments a little bit… LUSE: But you have that payment way longer, right? HORSLEY: Yeah, at the cost of adding an extra 20 years. It's like saying, \"Well, your credit card payment would be a lot lower if you just make the minimum payment, but you're going to be in hock for the rest of your life.\" You'll pay a whole lot more in interest and you will take a lot longer to accumulate any equity in your home … this would really chip away at that wealth accumulation piece of home ownership. Why homeownership is still culturally important  COHEN: I think [homeownership] is offering people a sense of security, that you're not going to get kicked out of your home because you can't afford rent anymore, or that rent prices go so high that you get priced out. That makes people feel like they can stay in a place and also connects to putting down roots … I think homeownership ends up being an almost forcing mechanism to commit to where you are. For a lot of people, it's just what it means to be an adult. As there are these other kinds of markers that have become optional, like marriage, like having kids … homeownership remains, I think, pretty across the board and across the ideological spectrum, something that people really aspire to and represents that they have \"made it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A new approach to homebuying LUSE: Rhaina, you reported on friends co-buying properties together. What are some of the perks and some of the pitfalls of this pathway to homeownership? COHEN: I was really struck by data from Zillow, and there were a few other reports that were consistent on this, that about 15% of people who had bought homes in 2024, had done so with a friend or relative. The prevalence of this, and certainly the interest in this, is more common as you go to younger generations. … Everybody I talked to also had this social piece as well — they wanted the company of the person that they were living with… One of them had lived alone as a renter and had felt like she had made it, and people respected that as being independent. During the pandemic, she felt lonely … and she decided she wanted to live with others. Ultimately, that led to co-buying. Zillow did research on why people co-buy, and about a quarter of them are doing it because they don't want to live alone. That's a major reason. It's not just affordability. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98856","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Blocks Order Finding Texas Congressional Map Racially Biased","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked a federal lower court ruling that found Texas' 2026 congressional redistricting map racially biased, with Justice Samuel Alito issuing the order as part of a broader trend of conservative justices halting redistricting rulings near elections.

U.S. Supreme Court on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas' 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Trump likely discriminates on the basis of race. The order signed by Justice Samuel Alito will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map favorable to Republicans to be used in the midterm elections. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections. The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas. Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case. If that ruling eventually holds, Texas could be forced to hold elections next year using the map drawn by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 based on the 2020 census. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there. The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina. The Supreme Court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It's not entirely clear how the current round of redistricting would be affected by the outcome in the Louisiana case. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Jets, chips and a clean slate: Saudi Arabia’s crown prince got almost everything he wanted from Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a visit to the U.S. White House, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman secured significant advancements in U.S.-Saudi relations under President Donald Trump, including designation as a Major Non-NATO Ally, F-35 jet sales, a new strategic defense agreement, and a framework for AI and critical minerals cooperation.

Analysis by Abbas Al Lawati and Becky Anderson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Just three years ago, the US was openly  reconsidering its relationship  with Saudi Arabia. President Joe Biden had vowed to make Mohammed bin Salman a pariah. Even arms sales to one of America’s closest military partners were put under review.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the crown prince and de facto Saudi leader walked into the Oval Office to find a different world - one where President Donald Trump defended him so forcefully that he scolded a reporter for “ embarrassing our guest ” when she pressed him on the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the Oval Office theatrics, the substance of the administration’s announcements tells the real story of bin Salman’s remarkable rehabilitation in Washington. It also highlights Trump’s willingness to move past the Khashoggi episode and deepen relations with a kingdom that has pledged  nearly a trillion dollars  in US investments and maintains business ties with his own family.\n \n\n   \n  The visit also underscores the crown prince’s growing clout and his ability to skillfully navigate great power rivalries to his advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps his biggest win was persuading Trump to drop the one condition Washington had long insisted on before sealing major defense and trade deals with Riyadh: Full normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The shift marks another reversal from just a year ago, when the Biden administration insisted that any comprehensive US-Saudi deal could only move forward if  all three of its components  – bilateral defense and trade agreements, Saudi normalization with Israel, and an Israeli commitment to a pathway to a Palestinian state – advanced together. But with Israel rejecting the prospect of a Palestinian state and Saudi Arabia refusing to soften its position, the framework stalled.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Trump administration appears to have decoupled those components, handing Riyadh most of what it has long sought on defense, economics and regional security.\n \n\n   \n  This week it designated Saudi Arabia a Major Non-NATO Ally, moved forward with plans to  sell it F-35 jets  “pretty similar” to those flown by Israel, and signed a new Strategic Defense Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  In a nod to Riyadh’s singular focus to rewire its economy away from oil dependence, the two countries launched an  AI cooperation framework  which includes clearing of the sale of advanced chips to the kingdom, signed a critical minerals agreement, and opened the door to expand cooperation on nuclear energy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also delivered on bin Salman’s regional requests as the crown prince tries to reshape the Middle East’s security landscape, agreeing to help end the civil war in Sudan\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office, bin Salman framed the new agreements as delivering benefits for both the US and Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a very important time in our history,” bin Salman said in the Oval Office on Tuesday, seated beside Trump.\n \n\n   \n    What Saudi Arabia didn’t get\n \n\n   \n  While bin Salman received almost everything Saudi Arabia has been seeking from the US, there were two notable exceptions: a green light to domestically enrich uranium for future nuclear plants and a formal defense commitment.\n \n\n   \n  The US has long been reluctant to back a Saudi nuclear program that includes domestic uranium enrichment – a process that can produce bomb-grade material if purified to high levels – but CNN understands that Riyadh is reluctant to give up its right to do so, citing its substantial uranium deposits. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News on Wednesday that the agreement doesn’t include domestic enrichment.\n \n\n   \n  Among Washington’s Arab allies, Qatar has the strongest defense relationship with the US. It hosts the biggest US airbase in the region, was declared a Major Non-NATO ally in 2022, and this year received the strongest US security commitment for any Arab state, through an executive order declaring that any armed attack on the nation would be regarded as “a  threat to the peace and security  of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that Saudi Arabia is seeking at least as deep a security commitment from Washington. A senior Saudi source told CNN the kingdom wants a permanent agreement that would last beyond Trump’s presidency, a move that would ultimately require Congressional approval. But a White House statement made no mention of any obligation to defend the kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  “What (bin Salman) reportedly wants is a Senate-ratified defense commitment along the lines of a NATO Article 5 pledge,” wrote Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment think tank, referring to NATO’s mutual defense clause. “The last time Washington delivered that was 65 years ago, with the 1960 US-Japan treaty.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a case to be made for such a pact, he continued. “The United States went to war to protect Saudi and Gulf oil before, a defense pact might prove to be a deterrent to future predators, and it would lock Saudi Arabia into a pro-American alignment for years to come, boxing out our competitors Russia and especially China.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia has been signaling that it is willing to seek defense partners beyond the US should Washington not make a stronger commitment to its security. In late 2023, bin Salman was  explicit about the threat  in an interview with Fox News, saying the US doesn’t “want to see Saudi Arabia shifting their armament from America to another place.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Riyadh has been gradually  improving its ties with Beijing , culminating in the surprise rapprochement  between Saudi Arabia and Iran  in the Chinese capital in March 2023. The message has been that the US is Riyadh’s  first port of call , but there are others too.\n \n\n   \n  And earlier this year, bin Salman followed through on his quest to diversify security partners, securing protection from Riyadh’s closest Muslim ally, nuclear armed Pakistan. The mutual defense agreement marked a striking expansion of the kingdom’s search for non-US security guarantees.\n \n\n   \n  That hedging has not gone unnoticed in the halls of power in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s a positive move,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a top Republican foreign policy voice, said about the growing defense partnership between Riyadh and Washington. “Because to pull Saudi as an ally of the United States in this direction, rather than to China, and it will also solidify normalization in that process, in a post Gaza world.”\n \n\n   \n  The Eurasia Group think tank said in an analysis piece last week that the US-Saudi relationship is now driven more by great power competition than normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “The kingdom has become a key strategic partner in the US’s competition with China,” it said. “The strategic convergence underway between Washington and Riyadh will continue to be underpinned by the role the kingdom can play in supporting the US in sectors that are crucial for US competition with China.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that Riyadh’s calculation on normalization has shifted as Saudi public sentiment toward Israel has grown more negative and the kingdom has already secured many of the gains it expected from Washington.\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he got a “positive response” from bin Salman on normalizing with Israel but said he wouldn’t “use the word ‘commitment’.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alison Main, Manu Raju and Casey Riddle contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Invest in crypto?

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by  February 17, 2026  in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2026 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615262","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:25:00-05:00","title":"These fans have sung their way to the National Women's Soccer League finals","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the National Women's Soccer League finals begin in San Jose, fans of the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC are bringing more than jerseys—they are bringing a vibrant, culturally rich fan experience through chants and songs.

The chant nods to the long-standing push for D.C. home rule and statehood, and grew out of heightened tensions earlier this year, when the Trump administration took control of the district's police force and deployed National Guard troops to the city. Borrowing from the global soccer canon Spirit supporters also borrow from the global soccer canon. When the energy in the stadium dips, they'll sometimes launch into a playful chant appropriated from English Premier League crowds. \"Let's pretend we scored a goal,\" they repeat. New York and New Jersey-based  Gotham FC  supporters — who will be cheering on the Spirit's opponents in the championship match — have similarly embraced U.K. soccer songs. One in particular has become an anthem. John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads,\" famously sung by Manchester United fans at their stadium, Old Trafford, has taken on a new life in the tri-state area. In 2023, Gotham FC fans reworked the song into \"Gotham Roads,\" a tribute to the team and the region. \"To use 'Country Roads' was actually my idea,\" said Marge Liguori, who leads  Cloud 9 , a big Gotham FC supporters group. \"I do also happen to be a Manchester United fan. So I kind of borrowed that, but worked with other fans to adapt the lyrics.\" All in it together For Liguori, the song resonates because it evokes a sense of home. \"I think that's what we find in our arena and in our community with our team,\" she said. This feeling of belonging is paramount to understanding why singing and chanting are such an integral part of sports events. \"Really, the team is more of just a metaphor for the community,\" said Max Jack, an ethnomusicologist and anthropologist at Indiana University who has studied the intersection of sports and music. He said singing and chanting allow fans to go through the emotional journey that is a soccer game together. \"It creates a sense of stranger intimacy that is incredibly deep and fulfilling,\" Jack said. \"It offers something that most people won't access in their day-to-day life.\" That intimacy extends beyond fan-to-fan relationships. Chants also help build bonds between supporters and the players they root for. After Gotham FC's 2023 NWSL championship, fans  serenaded  defender Mandy Freeman as she approached the stands. Freeman wiped away tears as she hugged fans across the railings. Those interactions — along with the fans' overall enthusiasm — matter to the team, Jeff Greer, Gotham FC's vice president of communications, told NPR. \"When we hear them chanting, we know that they are at our backs pushing us to victory,\" he said. The Spirit feel the same way. Their home matches at Audi Field in Washington D.C. are known for their high-octane atmosphere. \"Our players regularly credit 'Rowdy Audi' for being the 12th player on the field,\" said Spirit director of communications Ben Kessler. \"And a lot of that is because of how creative their chants and cheers are.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   The finals of the National Women's Soccer League are happening this weekend in San Jose, California.

SUMMERS: NPR's Chloe Veltman reports how fans' songs and chants bring everyone together on game day. CHLOE VELTMAN, BYLINE: The members of the Spirit Squadron - a major supporters group for the Washington Spirit soccer team - have been preparing all season to cheer on their players this Saturday. Meredith Bartley is the squadron's leader. MEREDITH BARTLEY: We have a chant just for when we score. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #3: (Chanting) Now the ball's in the back of the net. We'll do it again. BARTLEY: We have a chant for having a blast. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #4: (Chanting) You're my favorite soccer team. You're my favorite soccer team ever. BARTLEY: This season, we've started, in the 51st minute, a Free D.C. chant. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #5: (Chanting) Free D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEATING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #5: (Chanting) Free D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEATING) VELTMAN: This is a nod to the push for D.C. home rule and statehood. It began when the Trump administration sent National Guard troops into D.C. earlier this year. BARTLEY: And we have a chant for when it's been a little bit, and it's kind of a little boring, and we want to pretend like we just scored a goal to get everybody hyped back up again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #6: (Singing) Let's pretend, let's pretend we scored a goal. (CHEERING) VELTMAN: That one is inspired by this staple of British football matches - I mean soccer games - belted out here in a YouTube clip featuring Tottenham Hotspur fans. Supporters of Washington Spirit's opponent at this weekend's finals - Gotham FC - have also adopted songs that are popular in U.K. soccer stadiums. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #7: (Singing) Take me home, country roads. VELTMAN: This John Denver hit from YouTube has been a staple at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium for years. In 2023, Gotham FC followers decided to put their own spin on it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #8: (Singing) Gotham roads, take me home to the place I belong. MARGE LIGUORI: To use \"Country Roads\" was actually my idea. VELTMAN: This is Marge Liguori. She heads up the big Gotham FC fan group Cloud 9. LIGUORI: I do also happen to be a Manchester United fan, so I kind of borrowed that but worked with supporters to adapt the lyrics. VELTMAN: Liguori says the song is special because it evokes a sense of home. LIGUORI: And I think that's what we find in our arena and in our community, with our team. MAX JACK: Really, the team is more of just a metaphor for the community. VELTMAN: This is Max Jack, an ethnomusicologist at Indiana University who focuses on sports music. He says chanting and singing allow fans to go through the emotional journey that is a soccer game together. JACK: It creates a sense of stranger intimacy that is incredibly deep and fulfilling. It offers something that most people won't access in their day-to-day life. VELTMAN: And singing and chanting also enable moments of interaction between players and fans. Gotham FC supporters serenade defender Mandy Freeman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #9: (Chanting) Mandy Freeman. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEATING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #9: (Chanting) Mandy Freeman. VELTMAN: In this YouTube clip, Freeman looks visibly moved. The soccer star sheds tears and shares hugs across the spectator railings. Gotham FC's vice president of communications, Jeff Greer, says the team gets a big kick out of the fans' vocal support. JEFF GREER: When we hear them chanting, we know that they are at our backs, pushing us to victory. VELTMAN: That's a sentiment shared by the opposition. The Washington Spirit play at Audi Field in D.C. They call it Rowdy Audi because of the stadium's raucous atmosphere, and credit the fans for being the 12th player on the field.

If you grew tired of waiting, there are more options: a Brendan Fraser-led dramedy, a stirring Marathi-language love story and a documentary  about  a documentary. Wicked: For Good  In theaters Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The yellow brick road is under construction as we rejoin our favorite green and pink Ozian witches. Elphaba, exiled after defying both gravity and the fraud who calls himself a Wizard, is creating as much havoc as she can with just a broom. Glinda, meanwhile, is spreading Wizardly propaganda and \"obsessulating\" over the motorized pink bubble she's been given to make her appear magical. They both have issues with the blowhard Wizard, who is pushing fake news, and is also, let's say, dictatorious, or maybe, fascistified. Things are darker in Oz this time. If you've somehow missed the backstory to this backstory,  Wicked  — first a novel, then a Broadway musical — was conceived as a prequel for adults to the events depicted in  The Wizard of Oz. It was nothing if not complicated, both morally and plot-wise — origin stories for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow were mostly brushed in after the central witch frenemies were well established. But that meant filmmaker Jon M. Chu had a problem when the Broadway hit became  two  movies. The story's early part about growing up has songs that are popular, gravity-defying. The later part, though, is about wising up — about consequences, the politics of oppression. It kinda doesn't sing. So for this movie, Stephen Schwartz wrote a new tune for Ariana Grande about Glinda's life in a bubble — and for Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba, he penned a musical nod to the original Wizard of Oz called \"No Place Like Home.\" And they're fine — fabulously sung, even if they seem just as aimed at original-song Oscar nominations as at filling plot holes. They just can't make this prequel-sequel feel any less dutiful or by the numbers — rehashing bits of the 1939 movie classic, shoehorning in animals who no longer talk, when all you really want is that song that gives  Wicked: For Good  its title. After way too long, the song arrives — powerhouse voices singing about friendship and doing good when good is hard. And for fans, that might make the long, five-hour,  two -movie trek feel worth it. Not for me. I was hoping for at least entrancillating. Rental Family In theaters Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       In director Hikari's sentimental dramedy, Brendan Fraser plays Phillip, an American actor in Tokyo who lands an unusual gig with a Japanese \"rental family\" agency — playing stand-in roles in the lives of strangers. His disorienting first assignment is \"sad white guy\" at a funeral, where he's startled to see the \"corpse\" sit up in his coffin to watch himself being mourned. Phillip's better prepared when he's hired to play the groom in a sham marriage that will free a young woman from her restrictive family. After initial trepidation, he celebrates the success of the ruse by spending the night with a sex worker (presumably for the benefit of audience members unaware that transactional relationships are time-honored). In longer-term engagements — playing an inquisitive journalist so a movie star with dementia will feel he's still remembered, and playing dad to a vulnerable 11-year-old girl — he gets emotionally involved with the folks he's deceiving, and they with him. Phillip's eyes well with tears as the manipulative nature of his relationships become problematic, but the filmmaker isn't nearly as interested in exploring the ramifications as he is in manipulating us. Cactus Pears (Sabar Bonda) In limited theaters starting Friday \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Anand is a 30-something gay city dweller who's been caring for his dying father in Delhi, and who dreads traveling with his mother to their ancestral home in the countryside for ten days of ritual mourning. But once there, Anand reconnects with a childhood friend, also gay, and the two bond over their shared difficulties with families who want to know why they've not taken brides and settled down. Loosely based on filmmaker Rohan Parashuram Kanawade's own experience when his father died, the Marathi-language film offers a laconic but decently stirring portrait of men who struggle with lower-caste social restraints and familial obligations, and who ultimately find solace in each other. Zodiac Killer Project In limited theaters starting Friday  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       With financing and contract negotiations underway, Charlie Shackleton was already scouting locations and storyboarding a documentary when he learned he was being denied the rights to retired California patrolman Lyndon Lafferty's book  The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up . Having gone that far, he couldn't bear to let it go, so he made a film about the film he  would have made , and ends up sending up the whole true crime documentary genre in the process. Wry, precise, earnest, bemused, the filmmaker is forthright about the evocative but manipulative clichés he's employing — cigarette butt-filled ashtrays, reenactments filmed in soft focus from behind, the swinging interrogation light (\"why is it always swinging\"). He also points out the shortcuts he's taking (\"this is actually a library, not a police station\"). The resulting film is amusing, pointed, and gets to the very heart of what makes these documentaries so compelling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98589","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00Z","title":"What former ally did Trump call a 'ranting lunatic' this week?

It started before the competition officially began, in an early November sash ceremony that was  livestreamed on Facebook . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In it, Nawat Itsaragrisil — a Thai media personality and businessman who at that point was the pageant's director — stood in front of a room of begowned contestants, microphone in hand, and berated Bosch for not participating in some of its promotional activities. When Bosch stood up and tried to respond, Itsaragrisil called security to escort her out. She walked out of the room, followed by several other contestants including then-reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. Bosch  told Thai media afterward  that the director \"called me dumb because he has problems with the organization,\" which she said was unfair \"because I'm here and I do everything … and I'm just trying to [give] my best.\" \"And I think that the world needs to see this, because we are empowered women and this is a platform for our voice,\" she added. \"And no one can shut our voice, and no one will do that to me.\" At a press conference, a  tearful Itsaragrisil  said he had not called Bosch a \"dumbhead,\" as was widely reported, but was rather speaking about \"damage\" her behavior caused. He also apologized — to Bosch, whom he did not name, and fans —  onstage at a preliminary event  the next day, saying the \"pressure is a lot and I am … human.\" But the fallout continued. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Miss Universe Organization (MUO) President Raúl Rocha criticized him in a  six-minute video , in which he said Itsaragrisil, who is also the director of Miss Universe Thailand, \"has forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\" by showing the women a lack of respect \"in addition to the serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenseless woman, trying to silence and exclude her.\" \"Nawat, you need to stop,\" Rocha declared, adding there would be legal and corporate consequences from the organization. Rocha also said he would restrict Itsaragrisil's participation in the pageant, \"limiting it as much as possible or eliminating it entirely,\" though the two were  photographed together  at pageant events as recently as Thursday. In the final round of the pageant on Friday,  Bosch was asked  how she would use the title of Miss Universe to \"create a safe space for women around the world.\" \"As a woman and as Miss Universe, I would put my voice in the power and the service of others,\" she replied. \"We are here to speak up, to make change … because we are women, and the brave ones that stand up are the ones that will make history.\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum — the first woman to hold that position — applauded Bosch's win at her daily press briefing on Friday. \"I like that she spoke up when she felt that was an injustice and that is an example,\" Sheinbaum said, according to the  Associated Press . \"That thing they said about being prettier when you're quiet has been left behind. Women are prettier when we speak and we participate.\" Quitting judges, rigging allegations and a contestant's hospitalization The confrontation between Itsaragrisil and Bosch put Miss Universe in the spotlight weeks before the pageant kicked off. But recent days have brought even more scrutiny. This week, just before the pageant began, two out of the eight judges abruptly quit on Tuesday, just hours apart. One, French soccer player-turned-coach  Claude Makélélé , said he would not be able to attend the event \"due to unforeseen personal reasons.\" The other, Lebanese-French composer Omar Harfouch, has been much more vocal about his departure, alleging that the competition was rigged. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Harfouch alleged in a number of videos and  Instagram posts   that two days before the final, a \"secret vote was held to pre-select 30 contestants out of the 136,\" carried out by individuals who were not official jury members. \"I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,\" he wrote. The Miss Universe Organization responded with a  lengthy statement  denying Harfouch's accusations and suggesting he may have been referring to the selection committee of its \"Beyond the Crown Program,\" a separate social impact initiative with its own judging panel. \"The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,\" it wrote. When the  preliminary events  finally got underway on Wednesday, they were not without incident either. During the evening gown round, Miss Jamaica Gabrielle Henry  fell off the stage  toward the end of her walk. Social media  videos showed her  being taken away on a stretcher. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Henry did not compete in the finals. On Friday, Rocha, the organization president, said in an  Instagram update  that he had just visited her and her family in a Bangkok hospital, where she is under observation but has no broken bones. Since 2024, the Miss Universe Organization has been jointly owned by the Thai media company JKN and Legacy Holding Group USA Inc., a division of a Mexican company owned by Rocha. It has changed ownership multiple times since its creation in 1952, including a nearly two-decade stretch under now-President Trump that ended in 2015. The organization has struggled with  declining viewership  and  financial instability  in recent years, as well as broader questions around relevance, objectification and inclusivity in the modern age. Its host country changes frequently, and Puerto Rico's Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón  announced Friday  that the island will host the competition next year. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615204","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:48:00-20:00","title":"'I'm not going to be intimidated': Rep.

Treye Green edited the digital copy for this story.   \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Now we turn to Representative Jason Crow of Colorado. He's one of the Democratic lawmakers that was in that video message to U.S. service members. He's also a former paratrooper and Army Ranger. Congressman, good morning and thank you for joining me. JASON CROW: Good morning. FADEL: So what was it like to see the president call you and your colleagues traitors who should face execution? CROW: Well, it wasn't a great day. I can tell you that. It's not the first time I've received death threats doing this job, unfortunately, and I'm sure it won't be the last. But I'm not going to be intimidated. I'm not going to allow... FADEL: Do you consider what he said, the president, a death threat? CROW: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's no other way to take it. FADEL: I understand you've also gotten other death threats since these comments. CROW: Yeah. FADEL: Walk me through what you've been dealing with. CROW: Well, that's right. I mean, you can't have something like that come from the president of the United States and him tweet and retweet death threats from the Oval Office and not have people take that seriously. I mean, that is the environment that we're in right now. When somebody like Donald Trump says something, there are unfortunately people who will act on it. And I know this well 'cause I also lived through the insurrection on January 6. I was trapped at the House gallery while I saw Trump supporters brutally beat and try to derail our democracy. So I've seen this happen before. This is, unfortunately, the environment that Donald Trump has created for us. FADEL: Now, the White House later said the president doesn't actually want to execute members of Congress. He simply wants to hold them accountable. I want to play you a bit of what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had to say yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: To suggest and encourage that active-duty service members defy the chain of command is a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do. And they should be held accountable. And that's what the president wants to see. FADEL: Is that what you were doing in that video, asking the military to defy the chain of command? CROW: Oh, absolutely not. And they actually outright lied. Karoline Leavitt lied about what we said. What we said was U.S. law and the Constitution requires that service members only obey lawful orders, which is actually something that we are trained on from the very first days of our military career. The White House, the president, Stephen Miller and others then said the opposite of what we said and claimed that we were saying that they should disobey lawful orders, which, of course, is not at all what we did say or would ever say. So that is what they do, though. You know, they twist and contort and just lie about what people say and then weaponize it against them. And we're just never going to stop telling the truth, and we're not going to bow down from our duty. FADEL: Now, every one of you in the video have a background in military service, intelligence service. Why did you feel it was important to make this video reminding service members that they can defy illegal orders? CROW: Well, the president has made a number of very disturbing comments related to the use of the military, everything from saying he's going to go to war with Chicago to asking whether or not he could use the military to shoot peaceful protesters to suggesting that he's going to use the military at polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law. So given his statements and his lawlessness in the last 11 months, we are in an environment where things like this are very possible. They're even plausible. And then you add on top of that the fact that you have to train people before an incident, right? When I deployed my troops to Iraq in 2003, I didn't wait until they had to make a split-second decision on a mission to train them about what they had to do and what their obligation is. You train them before. I spent months training my platoon on marksmanship and small unit tactics but also the law - the law of warfare, the Geneva Convention. You cannot wait until they're in that moment. And that's what we're trying to do, is start a conversation with our troops, start a conversation with America about what could happen and what people will do and what their obligation is in that moment. FADEL: So it isn't that you are seeing illegal orders being ordered right now. It's that you're anticipating that things that are out there might come to be true? CROW: Well, I personally, and as a member of Congress, have deep concerns about a lot of the activity that the administration is undertaking. But what I'm talking about here and we were aiming at the video is... FADEL: Yeah. CROW: ...You know, what our troops, you know, our lower listed in ranking, our operational commanders might be facing in the months and years ahead if Trump indeed carries through on some of his threats. FADEL: The White House press secretary suggested your message could be punishable by law. Are you anticipating prosecution? CROW: I don't know. I mean, I'm not going to be intimidated or be made afraid. I mean, that's what they want to do. They want to silence dissent. They want the opposition to be afraid and to be intimidated. I took an oath to this country. This is a lifetime oath to do the right thing and to obey the Constitution and to enforce the Constitution. And no threats and intimidation by the president are ever going to stop me from carrying out that oath. FADEL: Democratic Congressman and former Army Ranger Jason Crow. Thank you for your time. CROW: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97414","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Robert Plant: Tiny Desk Concert","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert Plant performs a solo Tiny Desk Concert featuring songs from his new album *Saving Grace*, which includes covers of traditional folk songs, psychedelic rock tracks by Moby Grape, and a reimagined version of 'Gallows Pole'.

His latest solo album,  Saving Grace , is a collection of covers that range from the traditional spiritual \"Gospel Plough\" to \"It's A Beautiful Day Today\" by  Moby Grape , a psychedelic rock band that, Plant says, still makes him \"weepy.\" Plant and his band perform both songs for this set, along with a version of \"Higher Rock\" by the singer-songwriter  Martha Scanlan  and  Low 's \"Everybody's Song.\" They close with a new arrangement of \"Gallows Pole,\" another traditional Plant first reinterpreted for the Led Zeppelin  III  album in 1969.

isn't here yet \n         By Camila Domonoske \n        \n           Updated Friday, November 21, 2025 • 5:16 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         When the Trump administration announced it was  giving the green light  to the design for a female crash test dummy, it was welcome news to the advocates who have long fought for better female representation in vehicle safety. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This dummy has been on a long journey. And she's not at the end of the road yet. Vehicle safety tests in the U.S. use crash test dummies based on a male body. Advocates say it's no coincidence that women are more likely to suffer injuries in car crashes than men, even if you control for the severity of the crash and the size of the vehicle. Calls for an accurate female crash test dummy date back decades.  Consumer Reports  has  traced them back to 1980 . In the early 2000s, regulators added a small \"female\" dummy to tests — but it was just a scaled-down version of the male dummy, with breasts attached. That doesn't reflect the real anatomical differences between male and female bodies. Around the same time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) started thinking about creating a more accurate female dummy. For more than a decade, NHTSA has worked with Humanetics, the leading manufacturer of crash test dummies, to develop, build and test the dummy that the Trump administration unveiled this week. The new dummy is called the THOR-05F, or Test device for Human Occupant Restraint, 5th-percentile Female. (That is to say, a very small woman.) It's actually based on the female body. \"The pelvis for a female is more rounded and does not hold the seatbelt the same way,\" says Chris O'Connor, the CEO of manufacturing company Humanetics. He also pointed to anatomical differences in the neck, and significant differences in the lower leg that are correlated with much higher rates of leg injuries in women. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The dummy's design had previously been embraced by some regulators overseas, with European officials indicating plans to add it to tests within a few years. But it had been stuck in limbo in the U.S., where for several years NHTSA said that more testing and consideration was required before formally adopting the dummy. Adding a new dummy to the crash testing process will be costly — aside from the costs of development, individual dummies can each cost more than $1 million. The new design also won't necessarily represent all women; it has been criticized for being extremely small, rather than reflecting an average body size. Some safety groups  have argued  that using computer simulations, which can model bodies of various sizes, is a good way to diversify testing, although others say that having better real-life crash test data to feed  into  those models is essential. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So the road to this week's announcement from the Department of Transportation has been winding. \"This is a long overdue step toward the full adoption of this new dummy for use in our safety ratings and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards,\" wrote NHTSA administrator Jonathan Morrison. And the publication of technical documents and specifications is, indeed, just one step. A final rule still has to be published, and then the new dummy \"will be considered\" for inclusion in actual safety tests, the Department of Transportation writes in its  press release . Those tests have not yet been rewritten to include the new design. In a statement emailed to NPR, NHTSA says that the agency is using the female dummy in its own research, and that the new release \"provides the information the auto industry needs\" to start using it as well. But as for the federal New Car Assessment Program, which assigns safety ratings to new vehicles, the process of incorporating the new dummy will start in 2027-2028. Women Drive Too, an advocacy group that has long pushed for the use of female crash test dummies, welcomed this week's news in measured tones. \"We applaud this action, but by itself, it won't be enough,\" the coalition  wrote in a statement . They're still pushing for Congress to pass a law that requires the dummies actually get used in real-life crash tests. After decades of planning, the use of the new dummies in actual federal safety tests is still a few years away. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   This week, the Trump administration gave the green light to a crash test dummy based on a female body. In the U.S. right now, when carmakers test their vehicles, they are only required to use dummies based on male bodies. Efforts to add a female dummy have been underway for years. NPR's Camila Domonoske has been following the issue and joins us now. Hey there. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi. DETROW: So I can picture a crash test dummy in my head. I feel like I see the slow-motion video of the car crashing. And at that point, I don't actually know what car companies are doing with these dummies and the information they gather. DOMONOSKE: Yeah. The most important thing to understand is that the dummy that you see is packed with sensors, and it is designed to measure, to quantify how much force a body part is experiencing in a crash. So the dummies are not just shaped like people on the outside, they are designed to move like a real body would. So, Scott, if you think about your head and the weight of your head on your neck right now, a dummy needs to have a head that weighs as much as a human head, thereabouts - a neck that is as bendy as a human neck is. That's called biofidelity. It's basically the whole logic behind a crash test dummy. I was actually in the factory where a company called Humanetics makes crash test dummies a couple months ago. Engineering manager Jonathan Keck pointed out to me a shiny, metal part. JONATHAN KECK: This is a pelvis, yeah. This is a male pelvis. This is a Hybrid III 50th. DOMONOSKE: The Hybrid III being the current dummy design. So dummies also have ribs. They have spines. And all of those parts are packed with those sensors. DETROW: I was moving my head and neck around as you explained that. But if all these dummies have heads and pelvises and spines, why is it so important to have a female version? DOMONOSKE: Data shows that compared to men, women are more likely to be injured in the exact same crash. And meanwhile, cars have all of these safety features designed based on tests that use a male dummy based on a male body. Even when regulations did start calling for a female dummy, it has historically been a small male dummy with some rubber breasts slapped on it. Chris O'Connor is the president and CEO of Humanetics, and he says that just doesn't reflect real anatomy. CHRIS O'CONNOR: Pelvis for a female is more rounded and does not hold a seat belt the same way. We're seeing differences in the neck. And then the most significant is in the lower legs. DOMONOSKE: That one sort of surprised me, but the lower legs - anatomically quite different. Women are more flexible, for one thing. Women get way more injuries there. So the new body is based on the female body, and it's designed differently and, you know, has a lot more sensors in the calf area, for instance. DETROW: I'm curious, are there any arguments against requiring female dummies? DOMONOSKE: There has been some pushback. You know, one argument is that adding a single female dummy just doesn't reflect the wide range of real bodies, especially a very small female dummy, which this one is. It's not close to the average woman. So you would still be really relying on computer models to extrapolate, anyway. It would also be very expensive for carmakers to adopt this new dummy. Dummies last for a long time, and a new one can cost a million dollars or more. So, you know, obviously Humanetics wants to sell more dummies, and car companies might prefer not to buy them, so there has been a bit of a debate. But the Federal government has very clearly signaled for years that it wants to have this female dummy, and regulators worked with Humanetics to design it. It's just taken a very long time to get across the finish line. DETROW: When would companies actually start using them? DOMONOSKE: You know, the Department of Transportation just told me in a statement the auto industry could use the dummy immediately, but it will take time for it to be worked into mandatory federal tests. They're going to actually change the testing requirements to include this dummy in 2027 or 2028. An advocacy group that has called for these dummies to be used welcomed this design step forward but is still calling for a law to require the dummy be used. DETROW: NPR's Camila Domonoske, thank you so much. DOMONOSKE: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98694","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:57:00-05:00","title":"Transportation Department Endorses Crash Test Dummy That More Closely Resembles Women","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Transportation has endorsed a new crash test dummy designed to better represent women’s anatomy and crash risks, addressing significant disparities in injury and fatality rates—women are 73% more likely to be injured and 17% more likely to be killed in head-on crashes than men.

test dummy design that advocates believe will help make cars safer for women. The Department of Transportation will consider using the dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five star-ratings once a final rule is adopted, the agency said in a news release. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men. The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man. The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women. The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said. Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags. Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements but developments have been slow. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement. \"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said. Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor. \"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said. The department said the new specifications will be available for manufacturers to build models and for the automotive industry to begin testing them in vehicles. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599934","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"How could Trump interfere in the midterms?

Here's what voting officials are watching \n         By Miles Parks \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Less than a year from the midterm elections, state and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of interference by a federal government helmed by President Trump. The problem is, no one knows what might be coming. Steve Simon, the Democratic secretary of state of Minnesota, likened it to planning for natural disasters. \"You have to use your imagination to consider and plan for the most extreme scenario,\" Simon said. Carly Koppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County in Colorado, said officials in her state are shoring up their relationships with local law enforcement and county and state attorney's offices, to make sure any effort to interfere with voting is \"met with a pretty good force of resistance.\" \"We have to plan for the worst and hope we get the best,\" Koppes said. \"I think we're all kind of conditioned at this point to expect anything and everything, and our bingo cards keep getting bigger and bigger with things that we would have never have had on them.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump, who continues to spread false claims about voting in America, issued an executive order in the spring that sought to mandate  major changes  to the elections system. That order has so far  mostly been blocked  by the courts, but he's teased other executive action as well. And his administration is still  investigating  his loss five years ago, while  pardoning  people associated with his efforts to try to overturn that defeat. All of that has made it clear to those in the elections community that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a few things voting officials are watching for. More executive action to take control of voting The Constitution is  clear : States control their own election processes, with Congress able to set guidelines for federal races. The president has virtually no authority when it comes to voting. But Trump is testing that, and those in his circle have pushed fringe theories for how he can change how ballots are cast and counted. Earlier this month , press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House is working on a new executive order that will seemingly target mail voting. Trump also said earlier this year that he wanted to  ban some voting machines , though it's unclear exactly what he was referring to. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Election officials agree he does not have the legal authority to do either of those things. But recently, Trump ally and attorney Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump in 2020, broached a bolder strategy to enact election changes: declaring a national emergency. \"The president's authority is limited in his role with regard to elections except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States — as I think that we can establish with the porous system that we have,\" Mitchell said on a  podcast appearance  in September. It would be keeping with one of Trump's broader policy strategies: This year he's invoked presidential emergency powers  more frequently  than any other modern president. Election  experts  say there's no legal basis for Mitchell's theory, but numerous voting officials told NPR it's something that's come up in conversations about next year. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who previously oversaw voting in California as secretary of state, also brought up the scenario recently on the Senate floor. \"If the Trump White House tried to declare some fake national emergency to create a pretense for federal intervention, I will force a vote here in the Senate to stop it,\" Padilla said. Troops on the ground Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, says six months ago he wouldn't have taken the premise of federal troops at polling places seriously. But seeing how the National Guard was deployed — and justified — this summer changed his thinking. \"You have National Guard deploying to cities to supposedly quell these 'demonstrations' — basically  people in frog suits  and riding their  bikes naked  is the biggest threat,\" Hobbs said. \"And yeah, I start thinking that maybe it could be possible.\" Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump  spoke of  a desire to have federal law enforcement patrol voting locations, and this year, his former adviser Steve Bannon said on his  War Room podcast  that he hopes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are patrolling polling places in the midterms. Legal  experts  say such intervention is clearly illegal, but until the federal government disavows such actions clearly, Simon said voting officials have to game out how to respond. \"One thing that would help is if someone at the federal government would come out and categorically say, 'No, no, no, stop the presses, stop everything. You'll never have to worry about that. That's not something we would ever consider doing,'\" Simon said. \"That would go a long way.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to questions about forces outside polling places, and other scenarios mentioned in this story, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson characterized them as \"baseless conspiracy theories and Democrat talking points\" but did not directly answer whether the White House would commit not to send agents to voting locations. She reiterated that the president is permitted to send federal personnel to localities to help quell violent crime. Who is a trusted source? For the last decade, as voting officials have fought to dam up a tsunami of false information about their work, they've begged people in their communities to go to \"trusted sources\" for election information. In 2026, figuring out who is a trusted source may be more difficult than ever. Along with Trump himself, his administration has elevated to prominent government roles  numerous people  who have a history of spreading false information about elections, and local officials worry their message may be drowned out by those with much bigger megaphones. One of the hires alarming voting officials interviewed by NPR works at the Department of Homeland Security. Heather Honey, who's now deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity, worked alongside Mitchell for the past few years to help  spread election conspiracy theories , including one about votes in Pennsylvania that  Trump mentioned  in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a mob stormed the Capitol. \"I equate this to having a moon landing conspiracy theorist and flat earther being offered a job at NASA,\" Hobbs said. DHS did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Numerous   officials  at the Department of Justice also have a history of election denial. Unprecedented demands The insistence to  relitigate  2020 also has voting officials worried about what sort of actions administration officials plan to take. Already this year, DOJ has made unprecedented requests to investigate  voting machines ,  access  old ballots, and  accumulate  mass amounts of voter data. This summer, a  consultant  in Colorado contacted Koppes and other clerks in that state, in some cases saying he was associated with the White House and asking about accessing their voting machines. The White House denied to  CNN  and  other outlets  authorizing the requests, but separately,  in Missouri , a Department of Justice official reached out to clerks there asking basically the same thing. In each instance, they were told no. \"Since 2020, people in the elections world have become even more knowledgeable of the responsibilities of the different levels of government [when it comes to voting equipment],\" Koppes said. A similar push and pull is playing out with elections data. The Trump administration has quickly built what is essentially a  searchable national citizenship database , and is trying to entice states to run their voting records through it to root out noncitizens on voter rolls. While many Republican election officials have eagerly embraced the system, other GOP officials and their Democratic counterparts have been  hesitant to engage with the tool , as there are questions about how well it works, what happens to the voting data once it's been run through the system and, in many states, whether even using the tool is legal under state law. Still, the administration is intent to investigate voter rolls as it continues to push  false narratives  about widespread noncitizen voting. The DOJ recently  sued  eight states (all states Trump lost in 2020) in an effort to compel them to turn over their rolls. \"It's really not a red state or blue state thing,\" said Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of state of Pennsylvania, in an  interview with PBS News Hour  about the data demands. \"It is a — in my view, a concerning attempt, a concerning effort to consolidate and overreach at the federal level. In the United States of America, it's the states who run elections, not the federal government.\" Vulnerable targets Since Trump took office, the federal government has pulled back on virtually all of its work related to cybersecurity and elections. The Department of Homeland Security  laid off  employees focused on election security, and stopped  funding  a partnership that helped local elections offices share threat information. Wesley Wilcox, a Republican election supervisor in Marion County, Fla., said smaller counties especially will be more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the cuts, and Russia, China or any other U.S. adversary may see an opportunity. \"That's what I would do,\" Wilcox said. \"I mean, if I were on that side of the fence, I'm like, 'OK, they're cutting this stuff out. Let's go get them.' You know, 'cause the defenses are down.\" Secretary Hobbs, of Washington, told NPR that two years ago he was notified by DHS about a hack in one of his counties. The state responded immediately to make sure the breach wouldn't impact the voter registration database. Now, Hobbs said, \"I don't even know if I would have gotten that phone call, to tell you the truth.\" In Arizona, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat,  said  he didn't even contact DHS' cyber agency after an online candidate portal was hacked this summer because he didn't have confidence in the agency's \"capacity to collaborate in good faith or to prioritize national security over political theater.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615174","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:48:00-05:00","title":"South Africa hosts G20 as tensions with U.S. flare amid boycott","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa in November 2025 is marred by a U.S. boycott led by President Donald Trump, who criticizes the host nation's DEI policies and claims false racial persecution of white Afrikaners.

The Trump administration is snubbing the event over false race-based claims and what it considers the summit's DEI – diversity, equity and inclusion -- agenda. Since returning to office Trump has accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners. \"You know we have a G20 meeting in South Africa, South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore, because what happened there is bad,\" Trump said earlier this month. The government here has repeatedly tried to correct the U.S. administration, to no avail. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ramaphosa has kept his cool and was taciturn this week, saying: \"Their absence is their loss.\" Still, it's a huge blow to South Africa on the global stage. President Javier Milei of Argentina announced he isn't coming in solidarity with Trump. The leader of the world's second biggest economy, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is also not attending – though not as a slight – he isn't travelling internationally much these days. Then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin who can't come as he'd face arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine. William Gumede, an associate professor at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, says the summit controversy is a sign of the times. \"It is symbolic of the fractured global moment that we are in… it's almost an alternative summit without China and without America,\" Gumede told NPR. The summit's themes of \"solidarity, equality, sustainability\" are anathema to the U.S. administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying South Africa is pushing a quote \"DEI and climate change\" agenda. However other countries whose leaders  are  attending, like Germany, have praised the theme. U.S. Spat deepens As foreign leaders like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer started to arrive in South Africa on Friday, the  U.S.-South Africa spat deepened after Ramaphosa said the U.S. had made an eleventh-hour request to send a delegation after all. \"We have received notice from the United States…about a change of mind about participating in one shape, form or another in the Summit,\" he said. \"We still need to engage with them fully on what their participation at the 11th hour means.\" However, the South African leader said \"the United States being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be there, so it is pleasing there is a change of approach.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back angrily. \"The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa, I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States and that language is not appreciated,\" she said. She said because the U.S. is taking over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa, the embassy's chargé d'affaires—seen as a junior official -- would be there for the symbolic hand over. However Ramaphosa's spokesman said on X, quote \"The president won't hand over to a chargé.\" One of the big questions is whether the end of the summit on Sunday will result in a joint declaration by the countries in attendance – which the  U.S. is unlikely to sign. Tensions at home Aside from the geopolitical wrangling over the event, there has been discontent surrounding the summit from many in South Africa. Johannesburg residents have complained the city is only getting a cleanup for foreign guests despite having had crumbling infrastructure and chronic electricity and water shortages for years. \"Oh they are fixing, the traffic lights are up…the grass has been cut, all for? G20... You're showing off for visitors but you have no regard for the people that live in that city,\" journalist Redi Tlhabi said in her popular podcast. Ahead of the summit, on Friday, thousands of women dressed in black marked a day of action against gender-based violence, staying home from work and peacefully protesting by laying flat in parks and at university campuses. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group organizing the event, Women for Change, say they wanted to call attention to the high rates of femicide and violence in South Africa as the G20 convenes. Then there's been the war of the billboards. Trump's reason for snubbing South Africa has put race relations here in the spotlight and Afrikaners have differed in their responses. One right-wing Afrikaans rights group, which agrees with Trump that whites are being persecuted, has put up large billboards welcoming G20 delegates to \"the most race-regulated country in the world\" – a reference to affirmative action laws. In response, a progressive Afrikaner association has mounted their own campaign, with billboards showing the country's beloved rugby team, the Springboks. In the photo, two smiling white Afrikaner players carry their Black captain Siya Kolisi on their shoulders. \"Terrible things are happening in South Africa,\" reads the tongue-in-cheek tagline on the billboard. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   The world's biggest economy will be conspicuously absent from a meeting of the globe's 20 richest nations this weekend, as the US boycotts the G20 leader summit hosted by South Africa.

Our national nightmare — the year-long wait between Jon M. Chu's   Wicked: Part I   and  Wicked: For Good  — has finally come to an end.  When we last left  Chu's splashy, long-awaited adaptation of the Broadway musical juggernaut, green emo outcast Elphaba, soon to be known as the Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo), had been radicalized by the discovery that the revered Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) is a magicless fraud and oppressor of animals; she thus committed to  defying gravity  and becoming a broomstick-riding outlaw. Her polar-opposite enemy-turned-bestie Glinda (Ariana Grande) declined to take up the cause but wished Elphaba well. Songs were belted, hearts were broken, blonde hair was tossed, and since then, the real world we're all existing in only grew more chaotic and distressingly parallel to that of the one depicted in Oz. Wicked: For Good  is based on the show's second act, and ever since it was announced that the two hour and 45-minute production (including intermission) would be sprawled across two separate films totaling an approximate five-hour runtime, people like me have wondered,  What's the (non-capitalistic) point of that?  Having now seen  For Good , I can attest there isn't a point, or at least not a wholly convincing one. This installment is far from a total misfire — thank goodness Erivo and Grande are such captivating performers perfectly-suited to these roles — but the over-padding and stuffing meant to justify this bifurcated packaging soon becomes readily apparent. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       First, however, it starts off with a bang: The exciting opening sequence touches down upon the vast open landscape outside the metropolis of Oz, as the Wizard's human lackeys are forcing animals to do the brutal labor of building his precious yellow brick road; suddenly, Elphaba appears out of the sky like a superhero and wields her mighty powers to disrupt the abuse and send a message. The Wizard's press secretary Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh, tasked again with trying to sing, to limited results) has pulled out all the stops to spread hateful propaganda about Elphaba to the people of Oz, and the people are buying it wholesale. A willfully ignorant Glinda is now the bubbly spokesperson for the Wizard's regime, keeping the lie about his wizarding credentials alive. And the formerly apathetic Fiyero ( Sexiest Man Alive  Jonathan Bailey) is now a reluctant guardsman arranged to marry Glinda, even though his heart and political sympathies remain with Elphaba. A lot happens over the next two-plus hours, including the story coinciding with the arrival of that girl from Kansas (glimpsed a few times here, but as far as I can remember, not heard), and it's entertaining enough. The highest notes carry over from  Part 1 , as Erivo and Grande are electric every time they share screentime — their big comical fight, which takes place immediately after a devastating cyclone of events, elicited rapturous engagement from the audience at my screening. And their duet \"For Good\" remains the Act II apex, a stirring meeting of the minds and declaration of friendship, even if lyricist Stephen Schwartz's prose leans toward clunk. (Two decades later, I'm still scratching my head at \" Like a seed dropped by a skybird  /  In a distant wood .\" Huh???) If  For Good  doesn't soar quite as consistently as  Part 1 , this is at least partially by design. A song from the original show like the Wizard's vaudevillian ditty \"Wonderful\" — a more sinister retread of Glinda's far superior ode to the benefits of self-mythologizing, \"Popular\" — can't come close to matching Act I's abundance of bangers. (And unfortunately, the two new songs added here, Elphaba's \"No Place Like Home\" and Glinda's \"The Girl in the Bubble,\" add little beyond runtime.) Act II is also where the show's politics become indecipherable, or — to put it less generously — noncommittal. The story aims to challenge perceptions of what makes someone \"good\" or \"bad,\" but unlike its source material, Gregory Maguire's revisionist novel  Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West , the new movie sands down those provocations to make certain characters more sympathetic than they are. But within the landscape of movie musicals, especially more recent examples, both  Wicked  movies serve as a triumph and tribute to creative fortitude. We've all laughed (and cringed) a lot about Erivo and Grande's peculiar antics throughout this never-ending publicity cycle, but there's something heartwarming about their deep commitment to the spirit of the material. Whatever your feelings about it, this is clearly a spectacle that's been made with love, and that's all for the better. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97678","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:33:00-05:00","title":"Are there lessons for the U.S. in this European country's struggle with measles?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Romania, a wealthy European nation, is experiencing a resurgence of measles due to a sharp decline in vaccination rates, which began after its 1989 democratic transition.

Despite public health efforts, including motivational interviewing and outreach, vaccine coverage remains at only two-thirds, leading to outbreaks and serious health risks, including deaths and long-term complications.

for the U.S. in this European country's struggle with measles? \n         By Michal Ruprecht \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 7:33 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         As the U.S. continues to face its  worst  measles outbreak in three decades, another country that has struggled with measles offers a telling case study: the eastern European nation of Romania. While most countries hardest hit by measles are lower-income countries in the Global South, wealthier countries have also seen significant outbreaks. Romania is one of them. The country ranked  fifth  on the measles outbreak list last year, reporting 30,692 cases and  23 deaths . According to Dr. Aurora Stanescu, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Public Health in Romania, five of those deaths were children under age 1. Nina Schwalbe, a senior scholar at the Georgetown Center for Health Policy and Politics, calls those figures a \"wake-up call.\" \"That's a lot of cases of measles, and that's a lot of deaths from a disease that really shouldn't be killing anybody at this point,\" Schwalbe says. Unlike many lower-resource countries where measles  takes a toll  — such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen — Romania is an upper-middle-income country and part of the European Union. Even now, the consequences of low vaccine rates linger. The country  continues  to report measles cases in 2025. However, initial tallies are significantly lower than those of last year. According to public health specialists in Romania, the current numbers reflect how measles  tends  to come in waves. Amid a  growing trend  of vaccine hesitancy around the world, Romania's experience paints a cautionary tale. An authoritarian past \"The outbreaks aren't only a matter of poverty and not understanding the importance of immunization,\" says Dr. Mihai Craiu, a pediatrician at Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania. \"It's multifactorial.\" One of the forces driving the measles surge is Romania's political transition. Under the repressive Communist government that  ruled  for more than four decades, vaccines for childhood diseases were required. Immunizations were  given  to kids at school without parental consent, Craiu says. \"Virtually all children were immunized,\" he recalls. \"Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination were ideal terrains in which the Communist state could demonstrate its power and legitimate its authority,\" historian Dora Vargha  wrote  in a book about vaccines. \"If vaccination worked, the result would be immediate and visible.\" The measles vaccine was  introduced  in 1979. The result: a 90% reduction in cases,  according  to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And an immunization rate above 95%. That's the magic number for measles. \"If 95% of people are vaccinated, the measles virus can't find a home for itself in those people, and eventually it gives up,\" Schwalbe says. Then came political — and vaccine — upheaval. When Romania  adopted  a democratic form of government in 1989, citizens gained more freedom — including the ability to decline the recommended but no longer mandatory vaccine.   Like others in post-Communist countries, Romanians  grew  more distrustful of their government — and the immunizations it was recommending. This laid the foundation for anti-vaccine groups to step in and take advantage of the public mindset. \"Part of the perception of democracy in Romania was the liberty of not obeying the rules,\" Craiu says, noting that some Romanians view immunization as a form of Communist-era state control. When Romanians refuse vaccines, he says it's their way of asserting independence after decades of authoritarian leadership. The impact of an HPV vaccine campaign But vaccine refusal wasn't just about asserting personal freedom. People began doubting the benefits of vaccines. \"This decline [in vaccination] is partly due to decreased public confidence in vaccination benefits, reflected in parental refusal to vaccinate their children,\"  read  a report published in October by Romania's National Institute for Public Health — their equivalent of the CDC. This trend was exacerbated by growing skepticism about vaccines, exacerbated by the  2008 campaign  to vaccinate girls against HPV, the virus that can  cause  cervical cancer. That campaign deepened public skepticism about all vaccines, as  headlines  from various Romanian media outlets demonstrate. At the time of the HPV vaccine rollout, measles vaccine coverage stood at the recommended 95% rate. In subsequent years, it declined steadily,  dropping  by 20 percentage points by 2017 and further declining to just 62% in 2023. A study conducted by Stanescu and her colleagues last year  found  that only one of Romania's more than 40 regions had measles vaccine coverage above 95%. The pandemic exacerbated that sharp nosedive in vaccine coverage, the National Institute for Public Health report observes, noting disruptions in routine vaccination. As the share of those protected against measles decreased,  outbreaks  pummeled the country. \"Some saw the outbreaks in the 2010s as a wake-up call, but others didn't,\" says Dr. Gindrovel Dumitra, the vice president of the Romanian National Society of Family Medicine. \"Some people simply refuse vaccines — and even an outbreak won't convince them.\" A health system struggles to keep up Along with Romania's growing anti-vaccine movement, the country faces systemic barriers that contribute to its low vaccination rates. Dumitra points to three main factors: a  fragile health system  that remains one of the most  underfunded  in Europe, a  shrinking  number of primary care providers — driven by burnout and low compensation —   and the  absence  of mandatory immunization policies. Lack of funding for health care  disproportionately affects  minority groups like the country's  nearly  2 million Roma people. Minorities are often blamed for low vaccination rates, but Craiu says a deeper look reveals that the problem stems from inadequate outreach and lack of access to care. \"If you don't have a family doctor in your village, then first of all, it's difficult to get information and then it's also difficult to access vaccines,\" says Dr. Silvia Gatscher, the health operations manager at the World Health Organization Country Office in Romania. As the years passed, the clergy  became   influential  in  advocating  against vaccines — some say as a reaction to the government  limiting  church services during the early years of the pandemic. Simultaneously, far-right politicians  capitalized  on growing mistrust toward vaccines. One of those anti-vaccine lawmakers is Diana Sosoaca. She said, \"God is not vaccinated\" during a  brief speech  on the floor of the European Parliament last year. A free fall in immunization coverage Currently, only two-thirds of Romanians are fully vaccinated against measles. That's the  lowest  measles vaccination rate in the European Union. The shortfall has serious consequences. Researchers  estimate  that one person who contracts the virus can infect up to 18 unvaccinated people nearby. The risk is especially dire for children too young to have completed the two-dose vaccination protocol, which is  administered  first at 12 months and then again at age 5. That includes babies like Ionela Radulescu's son. Last year, the 7-month-old was hospitalized for pneumonia and came into contact with a child infected with measles. \"He had a rash on his face. It was pinkish and very small,\" the 31-year-old mother says through an interpreter. \"Then it started going down onto his chest and palms. It even went down to the soles of his feet. He had it everywhere.\" Radulescu lives in Suceava, in northern Romania. Last year, the area  recorded  the sixth-highest rate of measles cases among more than 40 regions. The frequency of cases in Suceava  mirrored  levels seen in countries before the measles vaccine became widely available. Although her son was too young to be vaccinated, the mother says: \"I felt bad. It was very hard. I started questioning myself and asking questions like, Was I too negligent? Was I not careful enough? You start to blame yourself. It's a really ugly feeling.\" And measles can be far more than an uncomfortable rash. The virus can  lead to  pneumonia, eye inflammation, diarrhea and ear infections, which can result in deafness in approximately 5 to 10% of cases. Even after recovering from the illness, children remain at risk for a rare and fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It typically  appears  about seven to 10 years after the initial infection. Stanescu estimates there have been about a dozen cases in Romania in recent years. \"Just because you're OK from that infection at the time doesn't mean that that infection doesn't have very serious consequences for you later in life,\" Schwalbe explains. A different way to talk to parents While Craiu and Dumitra admit it's an uphill battle, they've taken an evidence-based approach to combating misinformation and encouraging vaccination. \"It's a huge difference in what we learned in medical school and what I'm doing now,\" Craiu explains. When speaking with parents, Dumitra  uses motivational interviewing , a technique that helps patients adopt changes when they decide the change matters to them — not because a doctor said so. It also encourages physicians to listen without judgment, exploring a patient's ambivalence. The  American Academy of Pediatrics praises the method  as an effective way to improve communication about vaccines. \"Yesterday, when I recommended a woman to be vaccinated against the flu, she told me, 'I'm scared of the vaccine.' I asked her, 'Why?'\" Dumitra recalls. The woman explained she was worried the vaccine would worsen a chronic illness. \"After acknowledging her concerns, I offered her information and then verified if she understood it. She eventually got vaccinated.\" Lessons from Romania's outbreaks Gatscher is optimistic that evidence-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy will chip away at the mistrust and misinformation surrounding vaccines in her country. Yet the global measles count this year indicates that other relatively well-off countries aren't drawing any lessons from Romania. This month, Canada  lost  its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission,  with  5,000 cases so far this year. The U.S. has confirmed  1,723 cases  in 2025 so far, according to the CDC — the highest annual number  in more than three decades . While the U.S. has much to learn from what has happened in Romania, Schwalbe says America exists in its \"own bubble\" and often looks away from examples like Romania. \"I think we are incredibly good in America at thinking, 'That's what's happening over there, and it has nothing to do with us,'\" Schwalbe says. \"I don't think that Romania will teach us any lessons, unfortunately, even though it's such a clear lesson. The lesson to everybody — all over the world — is that when you lose high coverage of [vaccination against] measles, the disease comes back.\" Michal Ruprecht is a Stanford Global Health Media Fellow. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/coast-guard-swastikas-nooses-hate-symbols-policy-43b1ff282da18694184ff20ff8ce7c4a","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"23:16:43+00:00","title":"U.S. Coast Guard Reinforces Ban on Hate Symbols Amid Policy Shift and Public Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Coast Guard has issued a new, firm policy that explicitly prohibits the display of hate symbols such as swastikas and nooses, reversing a previous policy that had only classified them as 'potentially divisive.'

Guard has released a new, firmer policy addressing the display of hate symbols like swastikas and nooses just hours after it was publicly revealed that it made plans to describe them as “potentially divisive” — a term that prompted outcry from lawmakers and advocates. “Divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited,” the latest Coast Guard policy, released late Thursday, declared before adding that this category included “a noose, a swastika, and any symbols or flags co-opted or adopted by hate-based groups.” “This is not an updated policy but a new policy to combat any misinformation and double down that the U.S. Coast Guard forbids these symbols,” an accompanying Coast Guard press release said. The late-night change came on the same day that media outlets, led by The Washington Post, discovered that the Coast Guard had written a policy earlier this month that called those same symbols “potentially divisive.” The term was a shift from a years-long policy, first rolled out in 2019 , that said symbols like swastikas and nooses were “widely identified with oppression or hatred” and called their display “a potential hate incident.” The latest policy that was rolled out Thursday night also unequivocally banned the display of any divisive or hate symbols from all Coast Guard locations. The earlier version stopped short of banning the symbols, instead saying that commanders could take steps to remove them from public view and that the rule did not apply to private spaces outside of public view, such as family housing.

The latest Coast Guard policy appears to take effect immediately. After the initial policy change became public, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said the change “rolls back important protections against bigotry and could allow for horrifically hateful symbols like swastikas and nooses to be inexplicably permitted to be displayed.” “At a time when antisemitism is rising in the United States and around the world, relaxing policies aimed at fighting hate crimes not only sends the wrong message to the men and women of our Coast Guard, but it puts their safety at risk,” she added. Admiral Kevin Lunday, acting commandant of the Coast Guard, said the policy did not roll back any prohibitions, calling it “categorically false” to claim otherwise in a statement released earlier Thursday. “These symbols have been and remain prohibited in the Coast Guard per policy,” Lunday said in a statement, adding that “any display, use or promotion of such symbols, as always, will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.” Lunday’s predecessor, Admiral Linda Fagan, was fired on President Donald Trump’s first day in office . Trump officials later said she fired in part for putting an “excessive focus” on diversity and inclusion efforts that diverted “resources and attention from operational imperatives.” The older policy that was rolled out earlier in November also explicitly said that “the terminology ‘hate incident’ is no longer present in policy” and conduct that would have previously been handled as a potential hate incident will now be treated as “a report of harassment in cases with an identified aggrieved individual.” Commanders, in consultation with lawyers, may order or direct the removal of “potentially divisive” symbols or flags if they are found to be affecting the unit’s morale or discipline, according to the policy. The newest policy is silent on whether Coast Guard personnel will be able to claim they were victims of hate incidents. The Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security, but it is still considered a part of America’s armed forces and the new policy was updated in part to be consistent with similar Pentagon directives, according to a Coast Guard message announcing the changes. It also has historically modeled many of its human resources policies on other military services. The policy change comes less than two months after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of all the hazing, bullying and harassment definitions across the military, arguing that the policies were “overly broad” and they were “jeopardizing combat readiness, mission accomplishment, and trust in the organization.” The Pentagon could not offer any details about what the review was specifically looking at, if it could lead to similar changes as seen in the Coast Guard policy or when the review would be complete. Menachem Rosensaft, a law professor at Cornell University and a Jewish community leader, said in a statement that “the swastika is the ultimate symbol of virulent hate and bigotry, and even a consideration by the Coast Guard to no longer classify it as such would be equivalent to dismissing the Ku Klux Klan’s burning crosses and hoods as merely ‘potentially divisive.’” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the move “disgusting, and it’s more encouragement from the Republicans of extremism.” ___ Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615225","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-05:00","title":"The best new albums out Nov. 21","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a diverse array of new music releases on November 21, 2025, featuring De La Soul's long-awaited album 'Cabin In The Sky' following the death of founding member Trugoy the Dove, Tobias Jesso Jr.'s debut solo album after a decade, and multiple releases from jazz, funk, protest, and electronic genres.

The movement responds to widespread anxiety among artists and cultural institutions, fueled by recent political actions such as grant cuts from the National Endowment for the Arts, staff firings at the Kennedy Center, and executive orders requiring audits of Smithsonian museums. Inspired by visual artist Dread Scott and playwright Lynn Nottage, the initiative offers artists a collective framework to resist suppression, drawing historical parallels to movements like the civil rights era and resistance to fascism through art. Artists like John Legend, Ava DuVernay, Bill T. Jones, and Ann Patchett are participating, while local communities in places like Homer, Alaska, and Moscow, Idaho, engage in zine-making, performances, and open mic events.

   \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         On Friday and Saturday, artists across the country are participating in  Fall of Freedom  — an undertaking which they say represents creative resistance to authoritarianism. More than 600 events of all sizes have been announced across more than 40 states, from Alaska to Florida. \"I think the reality is that both artists and institutions right now are feeling this fear, and we're feeling unmoored about what we are supposed to do. And the fear, I think, of being silenced starts right here, starts in our heads,\" said Eric Gottesman, a visual artist based in Washington, D.C. He is also co-executive director of  For Freedoms , an arts organization that promotes civic engagement. Gottesman and other artists around the nation say that many of their peers at cultural institutions are feeling scared and isolated, following  sweeping grant cuts  at the National Endowment for the Arts, the  firings of programming staff  at the Kennedy Center and an executive order from President Trump requiring an  audit of Smithsonian museums . In August, Trump posted on social media that museums all over the country are \"the last remaining segment of  WOKE .\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gottesman added that many large cultural institutions seem to be stuck. \"I think in this moment, when arts institutions are paralyzed by the real fear of suppression and retribution for ideas that seem critical to the kind of freedom that democracy promises, they're not able to support artists in the way that artists usually expect arts institutions to provide support . . .and so this creates a gap.\" That's where Fall of Freedom is stepping in. Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright  Lynn Nottage , one of the organizers, said she is already seeing cultural institutions decline to program work that may be targeted as controversial or politically out of step. \"What we've encountered with regard to large museums is that they feel very fearful of retribution from the government,\" she said. \"There are more nos than yeses because of anticipatory obedience. Artists aren't afraid, but the institutions are afraid, and they are beginning to make decisions based on their fear of losing grants and losing their major donors. And that trickles down to the artists who are beginning to lose opportunities. As a result, exhibitions are being canceled. Plays are not being programmed.\" The idea for Fall of Freedom originated with visual artist Dread Scott, who approached her with an idea for \"an artistic action.\" Nottage said it was a lifeline. She said she had been feeling \"very paralyzed by how quickly things were shifting in this country. I knew I wanted to respond to the rising tide of fascism, but wasn't sure how. And then when he asked me to be part of Fall of Freedom, I thought, 'Yes, this is a beautiful organizing principle.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Scott's idea was to give artists an open-ended framework in which to use their creativity to speak to this moment. \"Part of what we're doing is trying to change the dynamic where these individual institutions are trying to make decisions for their own individual survival and trying to figure out how to sort of continue to make work under fascism,\" Scott said. \"And we're trying to say, 'No, actually, let's all stand up. They might be able to pick one or two of us off, but they can't get us all if we all collectively stand together.'\" Scott observed that art has always been a catalyst in social movements and political protests. \"I tell people that, you know, what would the civil rights movement have looked like without Billie Holiday doing ' Strange Fruit' ? Or what would the resistance to fascism have looked like without Picasso painting  Guernica ?\" He added, \" The Clash  and  Public Enemy  were deeply meaningful to me as a young art student trying to make my way in a world that I could see that was really terrible. …. Those musicians gave me license to say, 'No, the world is what's crazy, not you.'\" Fall of Freedom came about quickly, which Chicago-based artist and activist  Jenny Kendler  says she appreciated. \"You see how long it can take to develop cultural programs,\" she said. \"If I'm doing a museum show, we're planning it two years out. But we don't have that amount of time right now. We need to be responsive to this moment.\" Along with Scott and Nottage, other marquee names participating include musician John Legend, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, choreographer Bill T. Jones, and author Ann Patchett. Communities can also participate in zine making in Homer, Alaska, see a performance of the musical  Les Miserables  in Portland, Maine, and go to a dance party in Cheyenne, Wyo. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Moscow Contemporary , an arts organization in Moscow, Idaho – a city of about 27,000 people — is planning two days of events, including a roundtable discussion on civil disobedience and an open mic night. Roger Rowley, Moscow Contemporary's executive director, said he's thinking of this as just the start of a creative movement. He said you can think of the \"fall\" in the name Fall of Freedom as a decline – or as part of a cycle, or season. \"This is the  fall  of freedom,\" he said. \"And it's quite likely a winter of freedom that we're going to have to continue to struggle through. But we'll get to a spring of freedom and a summer of freedom on the other side.

More than 600 Fall of Freedom events have been announced. NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas spoke with some of the artists. ERIC GOTTESMAN: I think the reality is that both artists and institutions right now are feeling this fear. And we're feeling unmoored about what we are supposed to do. ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: That's Eric Gottesman. He's a visual artist based in Washington, D.C. He's also co-executive director of For Freedoms, an arts organization that promotes civic engagement. He says artists and arts presenters are feeling scared and isolated after incidents like the firings of programming staff at the Kennedy Center and an executive order requiring an audit of Smithsonian museums. In August, President Trump posted on social media that museums all over the country are, quote, \"the last remaining segment of woke.\" That's where Fall of Freedom is stepping in. Two of the organizers are visual artist Dread Scott and playwright Lynn Nottage. LYNN NOTTAGE: Dread approached me with an idea for an artistic action. And I was myself feeling very paralyzed by how quickly things were shifting in this country and knew I wanted to respond to the rising tide of fascism but wasn't sure how. And then, when he asked me to be part of Fall of Freedom, I thought, yes, this is a beautiful organizing principle. TSIOULCAS: Dread Scott's idea was to give artists an open-ended framework in which to use their creativity to speak to this moment. He says it's happening at a time when many cultural institutions, like museums and live event presenters, seem to be cowed by current politics. DREAD SCOTT: These individual institutions are trying to make decisions for their own individual survival and trying to figure out how to sort of continue to make work under fascism. And we're trying to say, no, actually, let's all stand up. They might be able to pick one or two of us off, but they can't get us all if we all collectively stand together. TSIOULCAS: Dread Scott says art has always been a catalyst in social movements and political protests. SCOTT: What would the Civil Rights Movement have looked like without Billie Holiday doing \"Strange Fruit\"? Or what would the resistance to fascism have looked like without Picasso painting Guernica? TSIOULCAS: Other marquee names who are participating in the Fall of Freedom include musician John Legend, filmmaker Ava DuVernay and author Ann Patchett. But it's also zine-making in Homer, Alaska, a performance of the musical \"Les Miserables\" in Portland, Maine, and a dance party in Cheyenne, Wyoming. An arts organization in Moscow, Idaho - a city of about 27,000 people - is planning two days of events, including a round table discussion on civil disobedience and an open mic night. Roger Rowley is Moscow Contemporary's executive director. He's thinking of this as just the start of a creative movement. It's right there in the name, he says. You can think of the fall in Fall of Freedom as a decline or as part of a cycle, a season. ROGER ROWLEY: This is the fall of freedom, and there's quite likely a winter of freedom that we're going to have to continue to struggle through. But we'll get to a spring of freedom and a summer of freedom on the other side. You put in the energy now and you reap the rewards later.

(AP) — Abortion is again illegal in North Dakota after the state’s Supreme Court on Friday couldn’t muster the required majority to uphold a judge’s ruling that struck down the state’s ban last year. The law makes it a felony crime for anyone to perform an abortion, though it specifically protects patients from prosecution. Doctors could be prosecuted and penalized by as much as five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Three justices agreed that the ban is unconstitutionally vague under the state constitution. The other two justices said the law is not unconstitutional. The state constitution requires at least four of the five justices to agree for a law to be found unconstitutional, a high bar. Not enough members of the court joined together to affirm the lower court ruling. In his opinion, Justice Jerod Tufte said the natural rights guaranteed by the state constitution in 1889 do not extend to abortion rights. He also said the law “provides adequate and fair warning to those attempting to comply.” North Dakota Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley welcomed the ruling, saying, “The Supreme Court has upheld this important pro-life legislation, enacted by the people’s Legislature. The Attorney General’s office has the solemn responsibility of defending the laws of North Dakota, and today those laws have been upheld.” Related Stories Origin stories behind the trophies heighten college football rivalry games on the smaller stage 2 MIN READ Tribal leaders say Trump administration failed to consult with them on Education Department changes 3 MIN READ Senate reversal of Biden policy that blocked Wyoming coal mining heads to Trump 2 MIN READ Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 legislation that became the law banning abortion, said she is “thrilled and grateful that two justices that are highly respected saw the truth of the matter, that this is fully constitutional for the mother and for the unborn child and thereafter for that sake.” Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on The challengers called the decision “a devastating loss for pregnant North Dakotans.” “As a majority of the Court found, this cruel and confusing ban is incomprehensible to physicians. The ban forces doctors to choose between providing care and going to prison,” Center for Reproductive Rights senior staff attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh said. “Abortion is health care, and North Dakotans deserve to be able to access this care without delay caused by confusion about what the law allows.” The ruling means access to abortion in North Dakota will be outlawed. Even after a judge had earlier struck down the ban last year, the only scenarios for a patient to obtain an abortion in North Dakota had been for life- or health-preserving reasons in a hospital. The only abortion provider relocated in 2022 from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota. Justice Daniel Crothers, one of the three judges to vote against the ban, wrote that the district court decision wasn’t wrong. “The vagueness in the law relates to when an abortion can be performed to preserve the life and health of the mother,” Crothers wrote. “After striking this invalid provision, the remaining portions of the law would be inoperable.” North Dakota’s newly confirmed ban prohibits the performance of an abortion as a felony crime. The only exceptions are for rape or incest in the first six weeks — before many women know they are pregnant — and to prevent the mother’s death or a “serious health risk” to her. North Dakota joins 12 other states enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Another four bar it at or around six weeks gestational age. Judge Bruce Romanick had struck down the ban the GOP-led Legislature passed in 2023, less than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to the state-level bans, largely turning the abortion battle to state courts and legislatures. The Red River Women’s Clinic — the formerly sole abortion clinic in North Dakota — and several physicians challenged the law. The state appealed the 2024 ruling that overturned the ban. The judge and the Supreme Court each denied requests by the state to keep the abortion ban in effect during the appeal. Those decisions allowed patients with pregnancy complications to seek care without fear of delay because of the law, Mehdizadeh previously said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/new-female-crash-test-dummy-design-228864ac691793f70372b103e305dc1d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:57:31+00:00","title":"U.S. to Introduce More Lifelike Female Crash Test Dummy to Improve Safety for Women Drivers","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Transportation is proposing a major update to its vehicle crash test dummy system by introducing a more accurate female model that reflects physiological differences between men and women, such as pelvic shape, neck structure, and leg proportions.

Department of Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government’s vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday night in a news release. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men. The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man. The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It’s routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver’s seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women. But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.

Follow on Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy’s support but said she won’t celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing — a step that has been delayed numerous times. “I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we’ve won,” Kuhn said Friday. “But we are far from crossing the finish line.” Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags. Despite Duffy’s announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said. “Certainly we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,” Young said. “But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we’re using are doing a good job.” Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow. U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement. “Any progress here is good because there’s simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,” Duckworth said. Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor. “It’s far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America’s roads safer for all drivers,” Fischer said.

diplomatic position — caught between placating its most important ally, the United States, and not capitulating to Russia, its much larger neighbor that launched a full-scale invasion nearly four years ago . The 28-point peace plan was crafted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and the Kremlin, without Ukraine’s involvement. It acquiesces to many Russian demands that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the proposal late Friday, saying it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement” if the U.S. can get Ukraine and its European allies to agree. Striking a diplomatic tone Thursday in his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy said his country needs a peace that ensures Russia does not invade again. He said he would work with the European Union and the Americans. Here’s a look at key elements of the proposal and the context surrounding them. Related Stories Khashoggi’s widow and Democrats demand release of call transcript with Trump and Saudi crown prince 3 MIN READ Zelenskyy says Ukraine faces a stark choice and risks losing American support over US peace plan 6 MIN READ Ukraine’s president is under growing pressure. Here are 5 things to know 5 MIN READ Territorial concessions THE PROPOSAL: The plan says it will confirm Ukrainian sovereignty while also stating that Crimea and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions will be recognized as de facto Russian land, including by the United States. According to the proposal, the borders of the other two regions Russia has partially occupied and claimed as its own — Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — will be frozen along the front line. Because Russia does not control all of Luhansk and Donetsk, the plan would, in effect, see Ukraine withdraw from areas Russia has not been able to claim in the fighting. This withdrawal zone would be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as belonging to Russia. The proposal also says Russia would relinquish other territories it controls outside the five regions, which could include the northeast Sumy region , where Russian forces have crossed the border, and areas around the eastern Kharkiv region that border Russia, although the details are unclear. THE CONTEXT: Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine will never recognize the occupied territories as part of Russia. For Ukrainians, the main issue with the plan lies in its contradictions, said Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukraine’s foreign affairs parliamentary committee. It starts by guaranteeing Ukraine’s sovereignty but then lists several points that would inhibit or violate that sovereignty, he said. The plan “is definitely a nonstarter, but I don’t rule out that it might be part of Trump’s game,” Merezhko said. “He starts with something absolutely absurd, ludicrous, which causes shock, and then he becomes more reasonable.” Security guarantees THE PROPOSAL: The plan says Ukraine must enshrine in its constitution a commitment not to join NATO and that NATO must adopt a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future. The size of the Ukrainian army would be limited to 600,000 soldiers, and NATO forces would be prohibited from being stationed in Ukraine, a measure that would curtail Kyiv’s right to choose who it cooperates with militarily. The plan addresses Ukraine’s hopes for membership in the European Union by saying Kyiv should receive short-term preferential access to the European market while it seeks to implement reforms to reach the standards needed for EU membership, including dealing with corruption . The plan also alludes to security guarantees from Ukraine’s Western allies but without going into detail. It is unclear how the U.S. would ensure Russia does not invade again. THE CONTEXT: Zelenskyy has continually made the case that NATO membership would be the cheapest way to guarantee Ukraine’s future security. Since he took office, Trump has made it clear that NATO membership is now off the table. NATO’s 32 member countries said last year that Ukraine is on an “irreversible” path to membership. But some NATO members, led by the U.S., have balked at moving forward with Ukraine while the war rages and before the country’s borders are clearly demarcated. NATO expansion THE PROPOSAL: The plan states that Russia will not invade neighboring countries, and that NATO, the world’s biggest military alliance, will not expand further. THE CONTEXT: NATO’s decisions are made by consensus, and there is no majority voting. The United States is by far NATO’s biggest and most influential member. Washington has traditionally driven the agenda but has stepped back under Trump. The alliance is the one international forum where the U.S. agrees to put its military might up for negotiation and can be persuaded to act differently by its allies. Accountability for Russian actions THE PROPOSAL: The plan asks Ukraine to relinquish any claims to hold Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine. THE CONTEXT: This would deny thousands of Ukrainians any chance to seek reparations or legal vindication of their suffering. U.N.-backed human rights experts have said Russia’s torture of Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war is a crime against humanity. Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said signing the plan would be “catastrophic” for Zelenskyy. “But the problem is, we can’t say no to Trump because there will fierce pressure from the White House,” he said. He also said some parts of the plan, such as Ukraine declaring itself a neutral country or giving the Russian language an official status, would require changes to Ukraine’s constitution. Those steps could only be taken through parliament and not by Zelenskyy. “Ukraine could offer to hold a referendum on these issues — that’s a compromise,” Fesenko said. Russia’s frozen assets THE PROPOSAL: The plan calls for Moscow to agree that $100 billion of its frozen assets would be invested in rebuilding Ukraine.

a crowd of spectators at the Dubai Air Show, killing its sole pilot. The Indian HAL Tejas smashed into the ground at the vast Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central, sending a vast fireball into the air and thick black smoke into the sky. Police vehicles, ambulances and a helicopter rushed to the site of the crash, spraying firefighting foam to extinguish the blaze. Onlookers, including families who gathered in a grand stand for the end of the air show Friday, gasped in horror and disbelief at the crash in this city-state in the United Arab Emirates. The airplane appeared to have lost control and dove directly toward the ground. The Indian Air Force confirmed the crash and said “the pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.” “IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief,” it said in a statement. It said “a court of inquiry is being constituted, to ascertain the cause of the accident.” Emirati crash investigators also will investigate the crash.

An SUV bearing diplomatic plates flying the Indian flag was seen at the site, along with police and emergency personnel. The air show resumed flight demonstrations about an half and a hour afterward, with the Russian Knights flying overhead as emergency crews still worked the crash site. Tejas is India’s indigenous fighter aircraft, built by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. The lightweight, single-engine jet is expected to bolster India’s depleted fighter fleet as China expands its military presence in South Asia, including by strengthening defense ties with India’s rival Pakistan. In September, India’s Defense Ministry signed a contract with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, or HAL, to procure 97 Tejas jets for the air force. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2027. The Indian government also signed a deal with HAL in 2021 for 83 Tejas aircraft. Deliveries, expected last year, have been delayed largely because of shortages of engines that must be imported from the United States. On Thursday, India’s Press Information Bureau rejected some social media claims alleging that a Tejas aircraft had experienced an oil leak while on display at the air show. In a statement on X, it called the posts “false” and said they were attempts to undermine the “fighter’s proven technical reliability with baseless propaganda.” It was unclear whether the aircraft in question was the one that crashed on Friday. Social media footage showed some kind of liquid dripping from the aircraft into gathered bags beneath it. “The videos show routine, intentional draining of condensed water,” the military said. “This is a standard procedure for aircraft operating in humid conditions, like those in Dubai.” Dubai has seen high humidity and fog over the last two days as the seasons change in this nation on the Arabian Peninsula. A Tejas fighter jet crashed in the western Indian state of Rajasthan last year, but the pilot ejected safely in that incident. ___ Saaliq reported from New Delhi."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-cop30-c2c66ea017db8984102702320142ce76","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"11:57:08+00:00","title":"COP30 Climate Talks Collapse Over Fossil Fuel Phase-Out Proposal","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the final day of the COP30 U.N. climate summit in Belem, Brazil, negotiations collapsed over a lack of explicit language on fossil fuel combustion and a transition roadmap.

because they failed to explicitly cite the burning of fuels such as oil, gas and coal as causes of global warming, and the talks appeared certain to sprawl past a midnight deadline. Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a top negotiator for Panama, said the decades-long United Nations process risks “becoming a clown show” for the omission. His nation was among 36 to object to a proposal from the conference president, André Corrêa do Lago of host Brazil, because it doesn’t provide an explicit guide map for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, nor to strengthen climate-fighting plans submitted earlier this year. Before nations moved into high-level negotiations behind closed doors, Monterrey Gomez warned that talks were on “the verge of collapse.” A few hours later, he said nothing much had changed. Do Lago started the day telling diplomats he thought they “are very close” to doing what they set out to do when they started meeting a week ago. When the all-country talks fizzled, do Lago pivoted to bringing in smaller pairings of negotiating teams for meeting in his office.

EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra reminded negotiators that countries had gathered at the edge of the Amazon to bring down emissions and transition away from fossil fuels. “Look at the text. Look at it. None of it is in there. No science. No global stocktake. No transitioning away. But instead, weakness,” Hoekstra said in a closed-door meeting of negotiators, according to a transcript provided by the EU . “Under no circumstances are we going to accept this. And nothing that is even remotely close, and I say it with pain in my heart, nothing that is remotely close to what is now on the table.” “After 10 years, this process is still failing,” Maina Vakafua Talia, minister of environment for the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said in a speech earlier in the day. “The Pacific came to COP30 demanding a survival road map away from fossil fuels. Yet the current draft texts that came out (do) not even name the main threat for our very survival and existence.” A key text among host Brazil’s proposals deals with four difficult issues. They include financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change and getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions. Then there’s the dispute over creating a detailed road map for the world to phase out the fossil fuels that are largely driving Earth’s increasing extreme weather. Any such plan would expand on a single sentence — to “transition away” from fossil fuels — agreed upon two years ago at the climate talks in Dubai. But no timetable or process was spelled out and powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia oppose it. More than 80 nations have called for stronger direction and Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also pushed for it earlier this month. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore urged nations to stand firm in opposition and hailed Lula’s involvement. “Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump and Russia under Vladimir Putin have bullied countries to support an absurd proposal,” Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said the latest document “even deletes the proposal to phase out the ridiculous and self-destructive subsidies for fossil fuels. This is an OPEC text,” he said, for the organization that represents oil-producing countries. Activists hang banners while participating in a demonstration at the COP30 U.N.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Tackling fossil fuels On phasing out fossil fuels, the proposal “acknowledges that the global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.” The text “also acknowledges that the Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster,” referring to the 2015 climate talks that established the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the mid-1800s. A key issue is that the 119 national emissions-curbing plans submitted this year don’t come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Though the text didn’t address a fossil fuel transition road map, it could eventually end in a vaguely worded section about a plan for the next couple years in a separate road map. The 36 nations who thought the text didn’t go far enough included wealthy ones such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany along with smaller climate-vulnerable islands Palau, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu. They said the proposal doesn’t meet “the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.” Colombian Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres said the presidency’s proposal is unacceptable to “those of us who are committed to life on this planet, to climate justice.” Irene Velez Torres, minister of environment and sustainable development of Colombia, front center, speaks during a session surrounded by other representatives from several countries as they discuss transitioning away from fossil fuels at the COP30 U.N.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a loyal supporter-turned-critic of President Donald Trump who faced his political retribution if she sought reelection, said Friday she is resigning from Congress in January. Greene, in a more than 10-minute video posted online, explained her decision and said she didn’t want her congressional district “to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for,” she said. Greene’s resignation followed a public falling-out with Trump in recent months, as the congresswoman criticized him for his stance on files related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with foreign policy and health care. Trump branded her a “traitor” and “wacky” and said he would endorse a challenger against her when she ran for reelection next year. She said her last day would be Jan. 5, 2026. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday night. In a brief phone call Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene’s resignation is “great news for the country.” He said had no plans to speak with Greene but wishes her well.

Here’s what to know about her five years in Congress 4 MIN READ Vance says Americans need patience on prices but says ‘We hear you’ on affordability concerns 2 MIN READ What’s next now that Trump has signed bill releasing the Epstein files 5 MIN READ Greene was one of the most vocal and visible supporters of Trump’s Make America Great Again politics, and she embraced some of his unapologetic political style. Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over conservatives, particularly his most ardent base. But her decision to step down in the face of his opposition put her on the same track as many of the more moderate establishment Republicans before her who went crosswise with Trump. The congresswoman, who recorded the video announcing her resignation while sitting in her living room wearing a cross necklace and with a Christmas tree and a peace lily plant behind her, said, “My life is filled with happiness, and my true convictions remain unchanged, because my self-worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.” A crack in the MAGA movement Greene had been closely tied to the Republican president since she launched her political career five years ago. In her video Friday, she underscored her longtime loyalty to Trump except on a few issues, and said it was “unfair and wrong” that he attacked her for disagreeing. “Loyalty should be a two-way street and we should be able to vote our conscience and represent our district’s interest, because our job title is literally ‘representative,’” she said. Greene swept to office at the forefront of Trump’s MAGA movement and quickly became a lightning rod on Capitol Hill for her often beyond-mainstream views. In her video Friday, Greene said she had “always been despised in Washington, D.C., and just never fit in.” As she embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory and appeared with white supremacists, Greene was initially opposed by party leaders but welcomed by Trump.

She was a trusted voice on the right flank, until McCarthy was ousted in 2023. While there has been an onslaught of lawmakers from both parties heading for the exits ahead of next fall’s midterm elections, as the House struggles through an often chaotic session, Greene’s announced retirement will ripple throughout the ranks — and raise questions about her next moves. Greene was first elected to the House in 2020 . She initially planned to run in a competitive district in northern Atlanta’s suburbs, but relocated to the much more conservative 14th District in Georgia’s northwest corner. The opening in her district means Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will have to set a special election date within 10 days of Greene’s resignation. Such a special election would fill out the remainder of Greene’s term through January 2027. Those elections could take place before the party primaries in May for the next two-year term. Conspiracy-minded Even before her election, Greene showed a penchant for harsh rhetoric and conspiracy theories, suggesting a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a coordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mused that a “so-called” plane had hit the Pentagon. Greene argued in 2019 that Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both Muslim women, weren’t “official” members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies. She was once a sympathizer with QAnon , an online network that believes a global cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got “sucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.” Rep.

She also drew ridicule and condemnation after a conspiracy she speculated about on Facebook in 2018, in which she suggested a California wildfire may have been caused by “lasers or blue beams of light” controlled by a left-wing cabal tied to a prominent Jewish family. When Trump was out of power between his first and second terms, Greene was often a surrogate for his views and brash style in Washington. While then-President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address in 2022, Greene stood up and began chanting “Build the wall,” referring to the U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump began in his first term. Last year, when Biden gave his last State of the Union address, Greene again drew attention as she confronted him over border security and the killing of a nursing student from Georgia, Laken Riley, by an immigrant in the country illegally. Greene, wearing a red MAGA hat and a T-shirt about Riley, handed the president a button that said “Say Her Name.” The congresswoman then shouted that at the president midway through his speech. Frustration with the GOP But this year, her first serving with Trump in the White House, cracks began to appear slowly in her steadfast support — before it broke wide open. Greene’s discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn’t run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn’t win. Greene’s restlessness only intensified in July, when she announced she wouldn’t run for Georgia governor, either. She was also frustrated with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, which worked in lockstep with the president. Greene said in her video that “the legislature has been mostly sidelined” since Republicans took unified control of Washington in January and her bills “just sit collecting dust.” Rep.

Republicans will likely lose the midterms elections next year, Greene said, and then she’d “be expected to defend the president against impeachment after he hatefully dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me.” “It’s all so absurd and completely unserious,” she said. “I refuse to be a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better.” ___ Amy reported from Atlanta.

summit , where the absence of the United States has underscored the need for greater cooperation to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nLula and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with key figures at the  climate summit  in Belem, Brazil, on Wednesday, seeking a deal that would bridge contentious issues.\n\n“We need to show society that we want this without imposing anything on anyone, without setting deadlines for each country to decide what it can do within its own time, within its own possibilities,”  Lula  told reporters, saying countries must find a shared “roadmap” on climate action.\n\nBut the Brazilian leader, who has positioned himself as a chief advocate of both climate action and greater collaboration between non-Western countries, has struggled to bridge divides on issues such as fossil fuel use and climate finance.\n\nScientists have warned that a failure to quickly transition away from the use of fossil fuels could bring disastrous changes to the planet’s ecosystem and result in dangerous increases in extreme weather across the globe with poor countries  more vulnerable  to severe impacts.\n\n“A road map is not a workshop or a ministerial meeting. A road map is a real workplan that needs to show us the way from where we are to where we need to be, and how to get there,” a letter from seven prominent scientists, including some who are advising the COP30 presidency, stated.\n\nWhile the US decision not to attend the climate summit has loomed large, other influential countries have also been hesitant to commit to ambitious goals.\n\nSome countries, such as  India , have criticised the lack of action by rich countries, which are responsible for a large majority of cumulative emissions and have been the subject of calls by poor countries to lower barriers to advancements in renewable technology.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a distant manifestation but is real and imminent,” Indian Environmental Minister Bhupender Yadav said in remarks to the conference on Monday.

Court on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas’ 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump likely discriminates on the basis of race. The order signed by Justice Samuel Alito will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map favorable to Republicans to be used in the midterm elections. The court’s conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections. The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections. The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas. Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump’s efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year’s elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case.

After bobbing up and down through the morning, the S&P 500 took off and rallied nearly 2% before finishing with a gain of 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 493 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%. It was a fitting finish for a week that left the S&P 500 just 4.2% below its record but also forced investors to stomach the sharpest hour-to-hour swings since a sell-off in April . The jarring moves are testing investors following a monthslong and remarkably smooth surge for stocks, and they come down to two basic questions, neither of which has been answered yet. Have prices for Nvidia , bitcoin and other stars of Wall Street shot too high? And is the Federal Reserve done with its cuts to interest rates , which would boost the economy and prices for investments? On the second question, financial markets found some assurance from a speech by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Markets perked up immediately after John Williams told a conference in Chile that he sees “room for a further adjustment” to interest rates. Related Stories OpenAI and Taiwan’s Foxconn to partner in AI hardware design and manufacturing in the US 2 MIN READ Bubble fears ease but investors still waiting for AI to live up to its promise 4 MIN READ Big swings keep rocking Wall Street as US stocks drop sharply after erasing a morning surge 4 MIN READ That could signal he’ll vote for another cut to rates in December. What the Fed does is critical for Wall Street because stock prices ran to records through last month in part because of expectations for a series of reductions. Other Fed officials, though, have argued against a December cut given how high inflation remains. The uncertainty created by such sharp disagreement has triggered dramatic moves back and forth for markets. The swings hit a crescendo on Thursday, when U.S. stocks initially surged after Nvidia seemed to tamp down worries about a potential bubble in artificial-intelligence technology. But the market quickly dropped to a sharp loss in its biggest one-day reversal since April , when President Donald Trump shocked markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs . Despite the strong profit report from Nvidia, whose chips are powering the move into AI, worries are still hanging around about the longer term. Will all those AI chips that Amazon, Meta Platforms and other companies are gobbling up actually yield profits and productivity as big as proponents are envisioning? If not, some investors fear, all the investment won’t be worth it. AI-linked stocks continued to swing on Friday, helping to drag the rest of the market behind them. Nvidia went from an initial gain to a drop of 4.3% and then swung back and forth before finishing with a loss of 1%, for example. Amazon went from an early loss to a gain of 1.6%. Bitcoin, meanwhile, briefly plunged below $81,000 before pulling back toward $85,000. That’s down from nearly $125,000 last month and brought it back to where it was in April, when markets were shaking because of Trump’s tariffs. The vast majority of stocks on Wall Street rose despite such swings, with nearly 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 climbing. Their movements often get drowned out by Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks, whose movements have much more effect on the S&P 500 because of their immense sizes. “When the largest companies drive most of the losses, the market can look weaker than it really is,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Several retailers led the way. Gap jumped 8.2% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Richard Dickson said it saw strong sales trends at each of its Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic brands. Ross Stores rallied 8.4% after it likewise delivered a better profit than expected. CEO Jim Conroy said it saw broad-based growth during the quarter and raised the company’s forecast for an important measure of sales during the holiday season. Homebuilders were also strong on hopes that lower interest rates could make mortgages cheaper and give a kick to the housing market. D.R. Horton jumped 6.8%, Lennar rose 5.9% and PulteGroup gained 5.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 64.23 points to 6,602.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 493.15 to 46,245.41, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 195.03 to 22,273.08. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased on hopes for cuts from the Fed. Traders are now betting on a nearly 72% probability of a December cut, up sharply from 39% a day before, according to data from CME Group. That helped send the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 4.06% from 4.10% late Thursday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after tumbling in Asia following Wall Street’s stunning reversal on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.4%, and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 3.8% for two of the larger losses. ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2211-02-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a range of global political, humanitarian, and economic developments.

Taken by Associated Press photographer Sal Veder, it won a Pulitzer Prize and has continued to resonate through the years, a symbol of the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. On Veterans Day, retired Col. Robert Stirm, seen in the photo in uniform with his back to the camera, died at an assisted living facility in Fairfield, California, his daughter, Lorrie Stirm Kitching, confirmed Thursday. He was 92. “It’s right in my front foyer,” Kitching, 68, of Mountain View, said of the photo. She was 15 when that moment of her running to hug her father was forever preserved. “Just the feelings of that and the intensity of the feeling will never leave me,” Kitching told the AP in an interview. “It is so deep in my heart, and the joy and the relief that we had our dad back again. It was just truly a very moving reunion for our family, and that feeling has never left me. It’s the same feeling every time I see that picture. “And every day, how grateful I am that my father was one of the lucky ones and returned home,” she added. “That was really a gift.” Stirm was shot down over North Vietnam Stirm, a decorated pilot, was serving with the 333rd Tactical Fighter Squadron based in Thailand in 1967. During a bombing mission over North Vietnam that Oct. 27, his F-105 Thunderchief was hit and he was shot three times while parachuting. He was captured immediately upon landing. He was held captive for 1,966 days in five different POW camps in Hanoi and North Vietnam, including the notorious “Hanoi Hilton,” known for torturing and starving its captives, primarily American pilots shot down during bombing raids. Its most famous prisoner was the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, who also was shot down in 1967. McCain and Stirm had known each other. They shared a wall in solitary confinement and communicated through a tapping code. “John McCain tapped in this joke. First time Dad laughed in jail,” Kitching said. “I just wish I knew what that joke was,” she said. “I’m sure it was something very ribald.” Photo represented heartbreak for Stirm Stirm, who was 39 when the photo was taken, told the AP 20 years later that he had several copies of it, but didn’t display it in his house. He had been handed a “Dear John” letter from his wife, Loretta, by a chaplain upon his release. “I have changed drastically — forced into a situation where I finally had to grow up,” the letter read in part. “Bob, I feel sure that in your heart you know we can’t make it together — and it doesn’t make sense to be unhappy when you can do something about it. Life is too short.” Stirm said the photo “brought a lot of notoriety and publicity to me and, unfortunately, the legal situation that I was going to be faced with, and it was kind of unwelcomed.” The couple divorced a year after Stirm returned from Vietnam and both remarried within six months. They came together for weddings and other family events. Loretta Adams died in 2010, of cancer. She was 74. “It hurt really deeply,” Kitching said. “She told him she wanted to make the marriage work. But she was being up front and honest. So every story has two sides, and I know very well just how difficult it is to understand the two sides.” Stirm retired from the Air Force in 1977 after 25 years of service. He joined Ferry Steel Products, a business his grandfather started in San Francisco. He also had worked as a corporate pilot. —- This story has been corrected; Stirm was flying in a F-105 Thunderchief, not Thunderbird, when shot down."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe geomagnetic storm, classified as G4 on the NOAA scale, is affecting Earth due to multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, which are causing vivid auroral displays across the northern United States, Canada, and Europe.

triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/at-least-41-dead-as-heavy-rain-flooding-and-landslides-hit-central-vietnam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:43:11+00:00","title":"At least 41 dead as heavy rain, flooding and landslides hit central Vietnam","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In central Vietnam, heavy rainfall exceeding 150cm over three days triggered deadly flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage, resulting in at least 41 deaths and affecting over 62,000 residents.

Antalya, ending a long standoff with Australia over the location of the top United Nations climate meeting.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Thursday morning that Australia had reached an arrangement with Turkiye to host negotiations in the lead-up to the 2026 UN climate meeting along with Pacific nations while Turkiye will assume the presidency of the official meeting.\n\n“What we’ve come up with is a big win for both Australia and [Turkiye],” Albanese told the Australian public broadcaster ABC Radio Perth.\n\nThe announcement comes as  this year’s COP30 climate summit  in the Brazilian city of Belem is due to close on Friday.\n\nAustralia had been pushing to host COP31 next year as a “Pacific COP” alongside low-lying South Pacific nations, which are increasingly threatened by rising seas and climate-fuelled disasters.\n\nDespite Australia’s efforts, Turkiye refused to back down in its bid to host the summit.\n\nTurkiye had said that as an emerging economy, it would promote solidarity between rich and poor countries at its summit, which would have a more global rather than regional focus.\n\nTurkiye will now have just 12 months to plan the meeting at the Antalya Expo Center due to the unusually long process to secure hosting duties and the lack of procedures in place to handle a situation in which two countries wanted to host at the same time.\n\nThe presidency of the  Conference of the Parties (COP)  to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change traditionally rotates among five regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, and Western Europe and others.\n\nAustralia and Turkiye both fit within the latter category of Western Europe and others, meaning that Australia will now have to wait another five years until it can bid to host the meeting again.\n\nEthiopian Minister for Planning and Development Fitsum Assefa Adela announced last week that her country had already secured the support of African negotiators to host COP32 in 2027.\n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) quickly voiced frustration with Australia for dropping its bid to cohost the COP with its Pacific island neighbours.\n\n“We are all not happy and disappointed it’s ended up like this,” PNG Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency.\n\n“What has COP achieved over the years? Nothing,” Tkatchenko said. “It’s just a talk fest and doesn’t hold the big polluters accountable.”\n\nAustralian Senator Steph Hodgins-May from the Australian Greens party said Australia’s withdrawal from hosting the meeting reflected the current Labor government’s “continued coal and gas approvals” as Australia continues to increase its exports of  fossil fuels .\n\n“This is extremely disappointing, but it shows that the world recognises Australia’s significant role in making dangerous climate change worse,” May said.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, both Australia and Turkiye are heavily dependent on coal, oil and gas for energy, but both countries have also been making progress in renewable energy.\n\nAustralia’s federal Labor government had hoped to showcase renewable energy progress in the state of South Australia by hosting the conference in the state’s capital, Adelaide.\n\nHowever, the proposal was complicated by the city’s struggle to cope with a significant toxic algal bloom that has been taking place offshore for eight months.\n\nAlgal blooms are one of many complications caused by warming oceans, an aspect of climate change that climate scientists and other experts said can be improved only by rapidly reducing dependence on fossil fuels."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/at-least-67-palestinian-children-killed-in-gaza-since-ceasefire-began-un","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:17:07Z","title":"At least 67 Palestinian children killed in Gaza since ‘ceasefire’ began: UN","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire began on October 11, 2023, at least 67 Palestinian children have been killed in the Gaza Strip, including a baby girl in an Israeli air strike in Khan Younis and seven others in a prior attack.

killed in the Gaza Strip  since a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last month, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says.\n\nSpeaking during a news conference in Geneva on Friday, UNICEF spokesperson Ricardo Pires said the death toll includes a baby girl who was killed in an Israeli air strike on a home in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday.\n\nIt also includes seven other children killed a day earlier, as Israel carried out  a wave of attacks  across the enclave.\n\n“This is during an agreed ceasefire. The pattern is staggering,” Pires told reporters of the death toll since October 11, the first full day of the truce between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“As we have repeated many times, these are not statistics: Each was a child with a family, a dream, a life – suddenly cut short by continued violence.”\n\nPalestinian children have borne the brunt of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, with UNICEF estimating last month that  64,000 children  have been killed and injured in Israeli attacks since the war began in October 2023.\n\nSave the Children  reported  this week that, in 2024, an average of 475 Palestinian children “suffered lifelong disabilities” each month as a result of the war, including traumatic brain injuries and burns.\n\nGaza has also become “home to the largest cohort of child amputees in modern history”, the humanitarian group said.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has been accused of using  starvation as a weapon of war , plunging the territory into a humanitarian crisis that led to several hunger-related deaths among children, who are especially vulnerable when food supplies run out.\n\nThis week, the Israeli military carried out a series of air strikes across Gaza in response to what it said was an incident that saw its troops fired upon in Khan Younis in the south of the Strip.\n\nHamas  rejected Israel’s claim , saying the latest strikes – which killed at least 32 Palestinians – were “a dangerous escalation” that demonstrates that the Israeli government wants “to resume the genocide” in Gaza.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF,  said on Friday  that its teams in Gaza had treated several Palestinian women and children “with open fractures and gunshot wounds to their limbs and head” amid the wave of Israeli attacks.\n\nZaher, an MSF nurse working at a mobile clinic in Gaza City, said they treated a woman with a leg injury and a nine-year-old girl with a facial wound caused by Israeli quadcopter gunfire.\n\nMohammed Malaka, a patient at al-Shifa Hospital, also in Gaza City, said he heard the sounds of two incoming missiles before he lost consciousness.\n\n“I opened my eyes and saw my father on the ground, and I saw my three brothers on the ground, covered in blood and dust was everywhere,” he told MSF.\n\n“I could hear people screaming everywhere … the tents had become ashes, and people were lying on the ground everywhere.”\n\nIn addition to the Israeli attacks, Palestinians across Gaza continue to struggle amid Israel’s continued restrictions on deliveries of humanitarian aid, including tents needed to shield  displaced families  during the colder winter months.\n\nUNICEF’s Pires said many children are “sleeping in the open” and “trembling in fear while living in flooded, makeshift shelters”.\n\n“The reality imposed on Gaza’s children remains brutally simple: There is no safe place for them and the world cannot continue to normalise their suffering,” he said, urging more assistance to be allowed into the territory.\n\n“For hundreds of thousands of children  living in tents  over the rubble of their former homes, the new [winter] season is a threat multiplier.

and Mamdani hope for positive relationship after ‘productive’ meeting\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have held talks in the  White House , expressing their hope for a productive and cordial relationship despite their history of mutual criticism.\n\nSpeaking to the press after their discussion on Friday, Trump praised  Mamdani  – the Muslim politician whom he once tarred as a “jihadist” and threatened to  strip him of his US citizenship  – for his successful campaign and emphasis on cost-of-living issues.\n\n“We’ve just had a great meeting, a really productive meeting. We have one thing in common: we want this city of ours that we love to do very well,” said  Trump , who grew up in New York, adding that Mamdani had run an “incredible race” and beat his rivals “easily”.\n\n“I appreciated the meeting with the president, and as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City,” responded Mamdani, saying he discussed issues in areas such as rent, utilities and groceries.\n\nMamdani, a democratic socialist who embraced New York’s status as a community made up of people from around the world and offered a firm defence of Palestinian rights, is politically at odds with Trump, whose nativist politics have depicted immigrants as a dangerous internal threat and previously pushed for a  ban on Muslims  entering the US.\n\nAsked about areas of disagreement with Trump, such as immigration enforcement, Mamdani said he hoped to work together towards shared goals despite their differences.\n\nHe referred to a video he shared in November 2024, in which he discussed issues such as affordability and US involvement in conflicts abroad with Trump voters after the 2024 presidential election. Mamdani said he now hopes to find common ground on ending US “forever wars” and bringing down the  cost of living .\n\n“I think both President Trump and I are very clear about our positions and our views. And what I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, of which there are many, and focused on the shared purpose that we have of serving New Yorkers,” said Mamdani.\n\n“That’s something that could transform the lives of 8.5 million people who are currently under a cost-of-living crisis, with one in four people living in poverty,” he said.\n\nWith polls showing growing concerns over the state of the US economy, Trump has recently spoken positively about Mamdani’s focus on cost-of-living issues, despite previous acrimony.\n\n“He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him,” Trump told reporters. “And I’m ok with that.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41Z","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/red-cross-to-cut-2900-jobs-slash-budget-as-donors-reduce-support","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:19:20Z","title":"Red Cross to cut 2,900 jobs, slash budget as donors reduce support","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is implementing major cuts in 2026, including a 15% reduction in its workforce of 18,500 staff and a budget cut to $2.2 billion, due to declining support from major donors such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.

significant cuts to aid funding and a systemic tolerance for grave breaches of international humanitarian law,” ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe organisation

ICRC’s largest donor but has reduced its contributions this year, mirroring funding  drops  from other traditional backers, including the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\n“The ICRC remains committed to working on the front lines of conflict, where few others can operate,” Spoljaric insisted, but warned that “the financial reality is forcing us to make difficult decisions to ensure we can continue to deliver critical humanitarian assistance to those who need it most.”\n\nGovernments are diverting budgets towards defence and security, leaving humanitarian agencies scrambling to sustain programmes while conflict, displacement and need continue to escalate.\n\nThe shift comes as Washington overhauls  foreign assistance  under President Donald Trump, whose “America First” agenda has reshaped

Zohran’s mayoral run\n\nIn early November, democratic socialist  Zohran Mamdani  won the New York City mayoral election in a landslide, a victory that sent shockwaves across United States politics and galvanised the country’s political left.\n\nIt was a dramatic turnaround for a campaign that – less than a year earlier – had been polling at 1 percent support.\n\nAmong those who were most surprised was Zohran’s own father, Mahmood Mamdani.\n\n“He surprised me and his mother,” Mahmood told Al Jazeera Mushaber reporter Allaa Azzam in an interview this week. “We wouldn’t expect him to become mayor of New York City. We never thought about it.”\n\nBut Mahmood, an anthropology professor and postcolonial scholar at Columbia University, framed his son’s electoral success as evidence of a shifting political landscape.\n\nZohran, for instance, campaigned heavily on questions of affordability and refused to back away from his criticisms of  Israel’s abuses against Palestinians , long considered a taboo subject in US politics.\n\nHe is the first Muslim person to become mayor of the country’s largest city by population, as well as its first mayor of South Asian descent.\n\n“There were certain things that were near and dear to him,” Mahmood explained. “Social justice was one of them. The rights of Palestinians was another.”\n\n“These two issues he has stuck by. He’s not been willing to trade them, to compromise them, to minimise them.”\n\nThe son of Mahmood and Indian American director Mira Nair, Zohran first emerged as the frontrunner in the mayoral race in June, when his dark-horse campaign dominated the Democratic Party primary.\n\nHe earned 56 percent of the final tally, besting former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nWhen Cuomo ran as an independent in the November 4 election, Zohran once again beat him by a wide margin, with more than 50 percent of the vote to Cuomo’s 41 percent.\n\nMahmood told Al Jazeera that, while his son’s sudden political ascent came as a surprise, his resilience did not.\n\n“It didn’t surprise us, with his grit and determination,” he said of the election. “I don’t think he joined the race thinking that he was going to win it. I think he joined the race wanting to make a point.”\n\nHe traced back some of Zohran’s electoral finesse to his upbringing. Zohran, Mahmood explained, was not raised in a typical US nuclear family but instead shared his home with three generations of family members.\n\nLiving with a diverse age range allowed Zohran to expand his understanding and build his people skills, according to Mahmood.\n\n“He grew up with love and patience. He learned to be very patient with people who are slower, people who were not necessarily what his generation was,” Mahmood said.\n\n“He was very different from the American kids around here who hardly ever see their grandparents.”\n\nMahmood also credited his son’s victory to a shifting political landscape, one where voters are fed up with the status quo.\n\n“There’s a mood of change. The young voted like they never voted before,” Mahmood said.\n\n“Sections of the population which had been completely thrown into the sidelines – Muslims, recent immigrants whether Muslim or not – he gave them enormous confidence. They came out and they voted. They mobilised.”\n\nLocal media outlets in New York reported that turnout for November’s mayoral race was the highest in more than 50 years. More than two million voters cast a ballot in the closely watched race.\n\nMahmood cast his son’s upcoming tenure as mayor as a test of whether that voter faith would be rewarded.\n\n“America is marked by low levels of electoral participation, and they’ve always claimed that this is because most people are satisfied with the system,” Mahmood said.\n\n“But now the levels of political participation are increasing. And most people, it’s not just that they are not satisfied, but they no longer believe – or they begin to believe that maybe the electoral system is a way to change things. Zohran’s mayoral term will tell us whether it is or it is not.”\n\nMahmood was frank that his son faces an uphill battle as mayor. He described politics as a sphere dominated by the influence of moneyed powers.\n\n“ I am not sure he knows that world well,” Mahmood said of his son. “He’s a fast learner, and he will learn it.”\n\nHe noted that significant resources were mobilised during the mayoral election to blunt  Zohran’s campaign .\n\n“ He’s taking on powerful forces. He’s being opposed by powerful forces. They failed during the campaign,” Mahmood said. That defeat, he added, “exposed the failure of money” as a defining force in the race.\n\nMahmood also addressed the role of Zohran’s advocacy on the campaign trail.\n\nThough faced with criticism from his mayoral rivals, Mamdani has refused to retreat from his stance that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.\n\nThat position, though widely affirmed by  rights groups  and  experts , including at  the United Nations , is relatively rare in mainstream US politics, where opposition to Israel is a political third rail.\n\nStill, voters appear to be shifting on the question of US support for Israel.\n\nA March poll from the Pew Research Center found that the percentage of US respondents with an unfavourable view of Israel has increased from 42 percent in 2022 to 53 percent in 2025.\n\nWhile  unfavourable views  were most pronounced among Democratic voters, they have also increased among conservatives, especially those under the age of 50.\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza has killed at least 69,500 Palestinians since its start in October 2023, and there has been continued outrage over  widespread Israeli violence  in the occupied West Bank as well.\n\nMahmood said the undeniable human rights abuses are causing a shift in public perception – and not just in the US.\n\n“The real consequence of Gaza is not limited to Gaza. It is global,” said Mahmood. “Gaza has brought us a new phase in world history.”\n\n“There will never be a return to a period when the world believes that what Israel is doing is defending itself.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/qatari-emir-arrives-in-dr-congo-after-rwanda-visit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:49:48+00:00","title":"Qatari emir arrives in DR Congo after Rwanda visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani arrives in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) following a visit to Rwanda, where he met President Paul Kagame.

east.\n\nOn his first trip to the African country, the Qatari leader was welcomed in the capital Kinshasa on Friday by DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and other officials.\n\nThe frameworkd agreement  was the latest in a series of documents signed in recent months as part of efforts, backed by the United States and Qatar, to end decades of fighting in eastern DRC that has been an enduring threat to regional stability.\n\nThe framework was described by the US and Qatari officials as an important step towards peace, but one of many that lie ahead.\n\nSheikh Tamim arrived in the DRC a day after visiting Rwanda, where he met President Paul Kagame.\n\nRwanda has long denied allegations that it has helped M23, which has seized more territory in the DRC than it has ever previously held.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall, reporting from Kinshasa, said the emir wrapped his brief state visit to the country after meeting the Congolese president at the airport and then at the presidential

that Qatar’s mediation efforts aimed at stabilising eastern DRC played a key role in strengthening dialogue between the two governments.\n\nIn eastern DRC, violence has continued despite the various

negotiations do not address the threat from a multitude of other armed groups operating in the volatile east.\n\nM23 seized Goma, eastern DRC’s largest city, in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, triggering a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\nQatar has hosted multiple rounds of direct talks between the DRC government and M23 going back to April, but they have dealt largely with preconditions and confidence-building measures.\n\nThe two sides  agreed  in July to a declaration of principles that left many key issues at the root of the conflict unresolved, and in October they reached a deal on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.\n\nThe July deal signed in Doha followed an earlier, separate peace agreement between the Congolese and

evening at  the COP30 summit  in the Brazilian city of Belem as they sought to bridge differences and deliver an agreement that includes concrete action to stem the climate crisis.\n\nA draft proposal

roadmap to phasing out fossil fuels, Yanakiew noted.\n\n“So this is a big divisive point,” she said, adding that another major issue at the climate conference has been  financing the transition  away from fossil fuels.\n\nDeveloping countries – many of which are more susceptible to the effects of climate change, including more extreme weather events – have said they want richer nations to shoulder more of the financial burden of tackling the crisis.\n\n“So there is a lot being discussed … and negotiators say that this might likely continue throughout the weekend,” Yanakiew said.\n\nThe deadlock comes as the UN Environment Programme  warned ahead of COP30  that the world would “very likely” exceed the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7-degree Fahrenheit) warming limit – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – within the next decade.\n\nAmnesty International also  said in a recent report  that the expansion of fossil fuel projects threatens at least two billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Nafkote Dabi, the climate policy lead at Oxfam International, said it was “unacceptable” for any final agreement to exclude a plan to phase out fossil fuels.\n\n“A roadmap is essential, and it must be just, equitable, and backed by real support for the Global South,” Dabi said.\n\n“Developed countries who grew wealthy on their fossil fuel-based economies must phase out first and fastest, while financing low‑carbon pathways for the Global South.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1367","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"01:24:51+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine

2, Shabir Ahmad’s home was swallowed by mud and swept into the river after relentless rains triggered a landslide in Sarh village in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Reasi district.\n\n“I had been building my house brick by brick since 2016. It was my life’s work. Only less than a year ago, I had finished constructing the second floor, and now there is nothing,” the 36-year-old father of three children told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmad’s was among nearly 20 houses in Sarh lost to the Chenab River that night, including one belonging to his brother, as dozens of families helplessly watched their farmlands, shops and other properties worth millions of rupees vanish without a trace.\n\n“We don’t even have one inch of land left to stand on,” said Ahmad from a government school in Sarh, where his family and other villagers were sheltering after the deluge.\n\nThe tragedy at Sarh was among the latest of increasingly frequent climate disasters across India that destroy lives and livelihoods, and displace millions of people to an uncertain future.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), climate-related disasters forced more than 32 million people from their homes in India between 2015 and 2024, with 5.4 million displacements recorded in 2024 alone – the highest in 12 years. This makes India one of the three nations most affected by  internal displacements  due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.\n\nMoreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.\n\nTo help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.\n\nManaged by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of  vulnerable households .\n\nDuring a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.\n\n“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.\n\nIn another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.\n\n“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.\n\nBut the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.\n\nGovernment records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.\n\nSince the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.\n\nAs a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.\n\n“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.\n\nAn official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.\n\n“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.\n\nIn the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.\n\n“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.\n\nThis year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.\n\nIn Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBehera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIn West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.\n\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.\n\n“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.\n\nIn the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.\n\nThakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.\n\nYet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.\n\nA government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.\n\n“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”\n\nActivist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.\n\n“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.\n\n“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”\n\nClimate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.\n\n“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.\n\nBhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.\n\n“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.\n\n“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”\n\nBhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.\n\n“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.\n\nBack at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.\n\n“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.\n\n“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/us-government-to-nix-october-inflation-report-after-history-making-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:50:51+00:00","title":"US government to nix October inflation report after history-making shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has canceled the release of the October 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Real Earnings summary due to a 43-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.

2025-11-21T19:50:51+00:00\n\nTitle: US government to nix October inflation report after history-making shutdown\n\nThe United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has announced it will not release inflation information for the month of October, citing the consequences of the recent government shutdown.\n\nOn Friday, the bureau updated its website to say that certain October data would not be available, even now that government funding has been restored and normal operations have resumed.\n\n“BLS could not collect October 2025 reference period survey data due to a lapse in appropriations,” it wrote in a statement. “BLS is unable to retroactively collect these data.”\n\nThe cancelled data includes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — a report that is commonly used to calculate inflation by measuring the changing costs of retail items — and the Real Earnings summary, which tracks wages among US workers.\n\nFor some of the reports, including the Consumer Price Index, the bureau said it would use “nonsurvey data sources” to make calculations that would be included in a future report for the month of November.\n\nThe November Consumer Price Index will also be published later than anticipated, on December 18.\n\nThe most recent government shutdown was the longest in US history, spanning nearly 43 days.\n\nIt began on October 1, after the US Congress missed a September 30 deadline to pass legislation to keep the government funded.\n\nRepublicans had hoped to push through a continuing resolution that made no changes to current spending levels. But Democrats had baulked at the prospect, arguing that recent restrictions to government programmes had put healthcare out of reach for some US citizens.\n\nThey also warned that insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire by the end of the year. Without an extension to those subsidies, they said that insurance premiums for many Americans will spike.\n\nRepublicans rejected the prospect of negotiating the issue until after their continuing resolution was passed. Democrats, meanwhile, feared that, if they passed the continuing resolution without changes, there would be no further opportunity to address healthcare spending before the end of the year.\n\nThe two parties hit an impasse as a result. Non-essential government functions were halted during the shutdown, and many federal employees were furloughed.\n\nOnly on November 10 did a breakthrough begin to emerge. Late that night, seven Democrats and one independent broke from their caucus to side with Republicans and pass a budget bill to fund the government through January 30.\n\nThe bill was then approved by the House of Representatives on November 12, by a vote of 222 to 209. President Donald Trump signed the legislation into law that very same day.\n\nTrump had openly sought to leverage the shutdown to eliminate federal programmes he saw as benefitting Democratic strongholds.\n\nHe also attempted to blame the political left for the lapse in government services, though he acknowledged public frustration with Republicans after Democrats won key elections in November.\n\n“If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” he told a breakfast for Republican senators on November 5. “That was a big factor.”\n\nThe Trump administration had warned as early as October that the month’s consumer price data would be negatively affected as a result of the shutdown.\n\nIn a White House  statement , Trump officials touted Trump’s economic record while slamming a potential lapse in the government’s collection of data. Once again, they angled the blame for any slowed economic growth at the Democrats.\n\n“Unfortunately, the Democrat Shutdown risks grinding that progress to a halt,” the statement said.\n\n“Because surveyors cannot deploy to the field, the White House has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for the first time in history — depriving policymakers and markets of critical data and risking economic calamity.”\n\nSeptember’s Consumer Price Index, the most recent available, showed that inflation across all retail items rose about 3 percent over the previous 12-month period.\n\nFor food alone, inflation for that period was estimated at 3.1 percent."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure, has died at the age of 97.

the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic

Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/can-pakistan-join-the-gaza-stabilisation-force-without-facing-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"04:44:05+00:00","title":"Can Pakistan join the Gaza stabilisation force without facing backlash?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan is being considered for participation in the United Nations’ proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, following the Security Council’s adoption of a US-authored resolution that supports a transitional administration.

backlash?\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan –  When the United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a  United States-authored resolution  that paves the way for a transitional administration and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, Pakistan – which was presiding over the council – had a seemingly contradictory response.\n\nAsim Iftikhar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN,  thanked the US  for tabling the resolution and voted in its favour. But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.\n\nThough the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the  mandate of the ISF .\n\n“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.\n\nBut the country had already endorsed US President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza ceasefire plan in September  – the basis for the UN resolution. And while several other Arab and Muslim countries have also cautiously supported the resolution, Pakistan, with the largest army among them, is widely expected to play a key role in the ISF.\n\nThe vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.\n\n“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.\n\nLast weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.\n\nPakistan has traditionally had close relations with Gulf states, and those ties have tightened amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Pakistan has long called for “Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital”.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.\n\nIn September,  Pakistan signed  a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the  Gaza ceasefire agreement . Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.\n\nBy then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it  shot down Indian jets , Munir  met Trump  in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.\n\nIn late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s  rare earth minerals .\n\nNow, Pakistan’s government is mulling its participation in the ISF. Though the government has not made any decision, senior officials have publicly commented favourably about the idea. “If Pakistan has to participate in it, then I think it will be a matter of pride for us,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on October 28. “We will be proud to do it.”\n\nThat’s easier said than done, cautioned some analysts.\n\nPalestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.\n\nThat makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.\n\nOfficially, the government has been opaque about its position on joining the ISF.\n\nEven while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.\n\n“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.\n\nIn a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.\n\n“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.\n\nSome retired senior officers say Pakistan will not decide the matter behind closed doors.\n\nMuhammad Saeed, a three-star general who served as Chief of General Staff until his 2023 retirement, said he expects the terms of reference and rules of engagement for any ISF deployment to be debated in public forums, including Pakistan’s National Security Council and parliament.\n\n“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nKamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.\n\nStill, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.\n\nSeveral countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.\n\nThe resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.\n\nHamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.\n\nSo far, the US has sent nearly 200 personnel, including a general, to establish a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) near Gaza on Israeli territory. The centre will monitor humanitarian aid and act as a base from which the ISF is expected to operate.\n\nUS-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Abraham Accords in 2020 and recognised Israel in Trump’s first tenure, has said it will not participate until there is clarity on the legal framework.\n\nKing Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.\n\nBokhari argued Pakistan has limited options, adding that many of its close allies are “deeply committed” to the initiative and have sought Islamabad’s participation.\n\n“Pakistan’s economic and financial problems mean it will need to reciprocate militarily in order to secure” the goodwill of the US and Islamabad’s Gulf allies, he said. “We have to assume that the current civilian-military leadership is aware of the domestic political risks.”\n\nOthers point to Pakistan’s long experience with UN peacekeeping. As of September 2025, UN figures show Pakistan has contributed more than 2,600 personnel to UN missions, just below Indonesia’s 2,700, ranking Pakistan sixth overall.\n\nQamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.\n\nPakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.\n\nSaeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.\n\n“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.\n\n“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.\n\nDespite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.\n\nBashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.\n\nStill, he said, “realism demands that we go along with a less than perfect solution”.\n\nBokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.\n\n“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.\n\nSaeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.\n\n“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.\n\nBut Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.\n\nHayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.\n\n“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with cases reported in all provinces and territories.

status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of AI-generated music and fictional artists is transforming the entertainment industry, while major tech companies like OpenAI and Nvidia face both innovation and geopolitical challenges.

trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/countries-sharply-split-on-fossil-fuels-on-cop30-climate-summit-final-day","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:21:45+00:00","title":"Countries sharply split on fossil fuels on COP30 climate summit final day","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the final day of the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, global delegates remain sharply divided over the future of fossil fuels.

northern city of Belem, potentially in a haze of recriminations.\n\nDelegates at the two-week conference have failed to reach a deal as Brazil circulated a new draft proposal on Thursday that did not include a roadmap to transitioning away from fossil fuels – nor mention the term “fossil fuels” at all.\n\nMore than 30 other countries from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Pacific co-signed a letter in response, slamming the draft and saying they “cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly and equitable transition” from nonrenewable energy sources.\n\nThe commitment to moving away from fossil fuels – including natural gas, coal and crude oil –  was considered a landmark achievement of COP28 in Dubai . Even then, the deal stopped short of calling for a “phase-out” amid fierce lobbying from oil-producing countries.\n\nA first draft of the COP30 text, which was publicised on Tuesday, did contain the option of building a roadmap away from such fuels.\n\nBut major producers and consumers, including China, India, Saudi Arabia and Russia, rejected the proposal, several news outlets reported, quoting negotiators familiar with discussions.\n\nThe United States – which backed a phase-out in 2023 under former President Joe Biden – did not send a delegation to this year’s conference.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has long slammed the climate crisis and global warming as a “hoax.”\n\nAnother point of contention is climate finance, meaning money to help countries adapt to climate change. Brazil’s newest draft calls for tripling climate financing by 2030 compared with 2025 levels.\n\nBut it left unclear who exactly would provide the financing, whether it be wealthy states, the private sector or multilateral development banks.

chief\n\nWashington, DC –  Yuli Novak, the executive director of the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, has a warning for politicians in the United States and across the world: The situation in Israel-Palestine is “disastrous”.\n\nDespite the US-brokered ceasefire that scaled back the  Israeli attacks  in Gaza, Novak told Al Jazeera this week that the conditions are more dangerous than ever.\n\n“Our warning is that we haven’t seen the worst,” she said, stressing that Israel must be held accountable for its abuses in Gaza.\n\nOver the past two years, numerous human rights groups have released reports accusing Israel of carrying out a genocide in Gaza — a campaign to destroy the Palestinian people.\n\nUnited Nations investigators , for instance, determined that Israel’s actions in the territory matched the definition of genocide under international law.\n\nBut B’Tselem provided another layer of analysis with  its landmark report , called Our Genocide, in July.\n\nIt dissected the decades-long history of Israeli policies that laid the groundwork for the carnage in Gaza, including the apartheid system, demographic engineering, the systemic dehumanisation of Palestinians, and a culture of impunity for abuses.\n\nThose conditions, Novak said, have been further entrenched since the war began.\n\n“As long as these things are still in place, we are very concerned that the violence that we’ve seen is not over,” she said.\n\nSince the ceasefire started, Israel has killed at least 360 Palestinians in Gaza, including 32 in a wave of air strikes across the territory earlier this week.\n\nThe Israeli government has also continued to impose restrictions on humanitarian aid to the enclave, including on  temporary shelters  needed to replace tents for tens of thousands of Palestinians who faced flooding earlier this month.\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians and turned most of Gaza into rubble.\n\nIn the occupied West Bank, conditions have been worsening, with intensifying settlement expansion and deadly Israeli military raids.\n\nOn Thursday, Human Rights Watch released a report documenting that Israeli forces  forcibly displaced  32,000 Palestinians from their homes in Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams.\n\nIsraeli settlers have also increased their attacks, regularly descending on Palestinian villages to torch homes and vehicles and at times  kill civilians  — often with the protection of the Israeli military.\n\nNovak stressed that settler attacks are a form of Israeli state violence.\n\n“They are Israeli civilians living in the West Bank being armed by the state. Sometimes, many of them wear [army] uniforms. Sometimes these are soldiers on reserve duty that are on a break,” she said.\n\nSome Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , have condemned settler violence, but Novak dismissed the move as a ploy to blame Israel’s policies on a “small group of crazy settlers”.\n\nNovak also highlighted that most of the killing and destruction in the West Bank is carried out by official Israeli forces, not settlers. “So this is another arm of the violence that Israel inflicts on Palestinians,” she said.\n\nNovak and her B’Tselem colleague Kareem Jubran have been in Washington, DC, this week, where they met with US lawmakers, including Democratic Senators Peter Welch, Jeff Merkley and  Chris Van Hollen,  as well as Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.\n\nNovak said the group wants to stress the need for accountability for the genocide in Gaza.\n\n“We are talking about a governing system, the Israeli system, that conducted genocide for two years — war crimes on a daily basis — and got away with it with no accountability,” she said.\n\n“The current situation is probably the most dangerous that we’ve ever been in because not only this violence and this criminality took place, it was also normalised, and in any moment, it can start again, go back to the same scale.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that there is peace in the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years because of the truce he helped broker in Gaza.\n\nAnd earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution backing the US president’s 20-point  plan for Gaza , which calls for an end to the fighting, gradual Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of an international force to the territory.\n\nThe plan would also see Hamas disarm and Gaza’s governance handed over to an international commission, dubbed “the Board of Peace”.\n\nIt has no accountability or compensation mechanism for the horrors that Israel unleashed on Gaza for two years.\n\nNovak said Trump’s plan is disconnected from the reality on the ground.\n\n“It just allows everybody to move on, instead of dealing with the situation and demanding Israel not only to be held accountable but also stop this kind of systematic oppression over the Palestinians,” she said.\n\nSince the Security Council embraced the ceasefire deal, Israel has faced less international pressure. Even the push for measures like suspending the country from the  Eurovision  singing contest  and European football have lost momentum.\n\nOn Monday, Germany announced it was  lifting restrictions  on weapons exports to Israel, citing the truce.\n\n“That is probably what scares us the most because we see regression here,” Novak said.\n\nJubran, B’Tselem’s field research director, also stressed the need for accountability, saying that the previous rounds of wars on Gaza  from 2006 onwards  enabled the genocide.\n\n“That’s what allowed the genocide system to be more brazen in order to do its crime against the Palestinians in Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nDespite the lack of political or legal accountability, Novak hailed the growing international public awareness of Israel’s atrocities, which she said politicians are choosing to ignore.\n\n“If there is something that gives us hope in this really, really terrible moment, it is the fact that many people around the world are able to see through the Israeli propaganda and just to make sense of what their eyes saw, and some of the voices of the victims were able to come out from Gaza and from the West Bank,” she said.\n\n“So people do understand. We are in the moment where people need to demand their leaders and politicians to hold Israel accountable.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through the solar system, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on renewed debate over US nuclear testing, sparked by President Donald Trump’s announcement that the Department of War should restart nuclear weapons testing.

US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/ex-leader-of-reform-uk-in-wales-jailed-for-10-years-over-pro-russia-bribes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:48:31Z","title":"Ex-leader of Reform UK in Wales jailed for 10 years over pro-Russia bribes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nathan Gill, former leader of Reform UK in Wales and a former Member of the European Parliament, has been sentenced to 10 years and 6 months in prison for accepting bribes from Ukrainian politician Oleg Voloshyn, a pro-Russian figure later sanctioned by the U.S., between December 2018 and July 2019.

platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9k0mrm2ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:21:53.658+00:00","title":"Steve Rosenberg: Putin uncompromising as leaked plan reaches Moscow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late November 2025, the US peace proposal for Ukraine—leaked and developed through discussions between US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev in Miami—has been acknowledged by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan  to end the war in Ukraine .\n\nThe same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\n\n\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".\n\nWhich brings us back to the peace plan.\n\nOn Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.\n\nAddressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.\n\nPresident Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.\n\nThe 28-point proposal,  which has been widely leaked and reported on,  appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy  Steve Witkoff .\n\nAccording to drafts of the peace proposal, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.\n\n\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.\n\nA peace proposal does not automatically mean peace.\n\nWhat if there's no agreement?\n\nPro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\n\n\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\n\n\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"\n\nBut after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\n\n\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.\n\nIt's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.\n\nMany. But not everyone.\n\nSome elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled  on Nato's Article 5 . That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\n\n\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"\n\nThe full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.\n\nFor now, though, Russia's  war on Ukraine continues ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20508y7w5yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"00:09:48.213+00:00","title":"G20: Will Trump’s no-show eclipse South Africa’s moment?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Africa, as the first African nation to host the G20, is striving to advance global equity by advocating for affordable debt, climate financing, and increased African participation in multilateral forums.

eclipse South Africa’s moment?\n\nWhen it assumed the presidency of the G20 last year, South Africa hoped that as the first African country to host the gathering of world leaders, it could champion issues that mattered the most to developing nations.\n\nFor instance, it wanted the 20 heads of state from the world's biggest economies to consider arguments that borrowing should be cheaper for developing countries, which pay two to four times more in interest on debts than more advanced economies.\n\nOther themes of this weekend's summit include securing climate change financing, increasing the participation of African countries in multilateral forums and ensuring that they get the best value out of their critical minerals.\n\nBut so far, discourse surrounding the meeting has been dominated by Donald Trump's very public decision not to attend.\n\nThe US president said he would not go due to the  widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs .\n\nThe relationship between the two countries has become increasingly fraught over the past year - the US expelled the South African ambassador to Washington, cut some of its aid funding and slapped South Africa with tariffs of 30% (the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa).\n\nAnd finally, after initially saying he would send Vice-President JD Vance to the G20 summit, Trump abruptly announced two weeks ago that no US representatives would attend.\n\nThe government in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, has tried to maintain a defiant but diplomatic tone. It has firmly denied claims of a white genocide and insisted that the summit would proceed with or without the US.\n\nIn a sudden about face, and with less than 48 hours to go before the G20 conference, the US announced that it would be sending a small team of its in-country diplomats to the handover ceremony, but that it wouldn't take part in any discussions.\n\nAs tension between the two nations shows no sign of letting up, there are concerns that South African diplomats may be frozen out of meetings when the US takes over the G20 presidency next year.\n\nSouth Africa's Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters earlier this week that there's only one way they would not attend next year's meetings.\n\n\"We are members of the G20, we're not an invited country. So we don't need an invitation from anybody,\" he said.\n\n\"If the United States do not want us to participate, the only way they can do it is to decline us visas.\"\n\nSo will South Africa manage to reach its aims without the presence of the world's wealthiest nation? Professor Richard Calland, from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, thinks it can.\n\n\"I think that people who are serious-minded in their analysis will not attach much weight to [the US' absence],\" he says.\n\n\"Ironically, the absence of President Trump may create more space for real consensus, because people won't be constantly looking over their shoulder at him and trying to anticipate or navigate his conduct and his positioning.\"\n\nProf Calland adds that the absence of the US may enable middle powers to step up and push for the reforms they want by issuing a joint declaration.\n\nAnswering reporters' questions at the summit's venue in Johannesburg on Monday, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola echoed this sentiment.\n\n\"[The United States] are absent, so in their absence, the countries that are present must make a decision.\n\n\"We are forging ahead to persuade the countries that are present that we must adopt a leaders' declaration because the institution cannot be bogged down by someone who's absent,\" he said.\n\nThe leaders' declaration is a culmination of work done throughout the year to build consensus on issues affecting the global economy, including trade barriers, technological advancements and climate change. It outlines what decisions the members have agreed to act on moving forward.\n\nPresident Trump isn't the only head of state who will not be attending. China's Xi Jinping is sending his Premier Li Qiang, who has represented the president in a number of meetings this year.\n\nRussian leader  Vladimir Putin will also be absent due to the International Criminal Court's warrant against him .\n\nMexico's Claudia Sheinbaum is another leader who will not be attending.\n\nAnd Argentinian President and Trump ally, Javier Milei, is skipping the summit in solidarity with Washington.\n\nHowever, unlike the US, all of these countries are sending senior delegations to represent their countries' interests.\n\nMr Lamola was keen to downplay the significance of these absences, saying sometimes heads of state are not able to attend major events, and it is \"nothing abnormal\" for them to send a replacement.\n\nOther global powers have expressed their support of South Africa's presidency of the G20, including France, the UK and the European Union, which signed a deal with South Africa on Thursday agreeing to boost the extraction and, more importantly, the domestic processing, of critical minerals.\n\nAfrican countries have long argued that processing minerals in their countries before exporting them would boost their economies by providing much-needed development, jobs and income.\n\nThese are the types of initiatives that Pretoria has spent the year lobbying for across various working groups and ministerial meetings.\n\nSouth Africa is the last G20 country to take over the presidency in this current cycle. It's also the last country in the global south to host the gathering. Indonesia, India and Brazil have led the summit over the past three years.\n\nAs such, the South African government says it wants to use its presidency to bridge the developmental divide between the global north and south. It wants to push for equity, sustainability and shared prosperity.\n\nAlthough building consensus through multilateral institutions like the G20 is becoming increasingly fraught in a divided world, Prof Calland argues that it is needed more than ever.\n\n\"Human life on Earth is facing an existential set of challenges, whether it's climate change, demographic shifts, technological revolution and so on.\n\n\"All of these are hugely difficult pressure points for human society. And you can't deal with them unless there is international collaboration and cooperation,\" he says.\n\nPresident Trump and his supporters argue that multilateral organisations do little to change real people's lives, preferring instead bilateral deals done directly between two countries.\n\nBut South Africa and other developing countries argue that issues like reducing the cost of borrowing for poorer countries require the input of international institutions like the IMF and cannot be done through one-on-one deals.\n\nIn many ways, South Africa's presidency of the G20 is part of a wider debate around multilateralism and its effectiveness.\n\nIf South Africa is able to convince other G20 members to issue a joint declaration on Sunday, it might have succeeded in proving that consensus can be reached without the participation of the world's most powerful country.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q5ewew4geo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"21:21:41.451+00:00","title":"COP30: UN climate summit drops mention of fossil fuels from draft deal","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 UN climate summit in Belém, Brazil, a major dispute has emerged over whether to include a commitment to reduce fossil fuel use.

COP30: UN climate summit drops mention of fossil fuels from draft deal\n\nA bitter row over fossil fuels has broken out at the COP30 UN climate talks in Belém, Brazil, as the meeting formally runs over time.\n\nAt the heart of the row is a disagreement over how strong a deal should be on working to reduce the world's use of fossil fuels, whose emissions are by far the largest contributor to climate change.\n\nThe dispute pits groups of countries against each other, but all 194 parties must agree in order to pass a deal at the two-week summit.\n\nRepresentatives and observers from inside a guarded negotiating room say the talks have become very difficult.\n\nOne negotiator inside the room told the BBC that there \"is a lot of fighting\".\n\nThe talks were meant to finish at 1800 local time (2100GMT) and will now spill into overtime.\n\nBut the cruise ships that many delegations are staying on due to lack of accommodation in Belém depart the city on Saturday, piling on the pressure.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and some countries including the UK want the summit to commit nations to stronger, faster action to reduce their use of fossil fuels.\n\nIt would advance a deal made two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, that committed countries to \"transition away from fossil fuels\".\n\nA first draft of an agreement in Brazil offered three options including timeframes, but the latest version has no mention of fossil fuels.\n\nFrench Environment Minister Monique Barbut said the deal was being blocked by \"oil-producing countries - Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, but joined by many emerging countries.\" She added: \"As it stands now, we have nothing left.\"\n\nThe BBC has approached Saudi Arabia for comment.\n\nSpeaking to journalists outside the negotiating room, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said the UK was determined to keep \"alive\" at the talks a plan to take further action on fossil fuels.\n\n\"It's hard, it's sweaty, it's frustrating. There's a big divergence of views,\" he said.\n\n\"We are determined that one way or another, this innovative idea, with the support of more than 80 countries to have a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels, is kept alive at this COP,\" he said.\n\nMr Miliband added: \"I think that in 10-20 years time people will say, \"You were the generation that saw the climate crisis around you.

Greenlandic families fight to get children back after parenting tests banned\n\nWhen Keira's daughter was born last November, she was given two hours with her before the baby was taken into care.\n\n\"Right when she came out, I started counting the minutes,\" Keira, 39, recalls.\n\n\"I kept looking at the clock to see how long we had.\"\n\nWhen the moment came for Zammi to be taken from her arms, Keira says she sobbed uncontrollably, whispering \"sorry\" to her baby.\n\n\"It felt like a part of my soul died.\"\n\nNow Keira is one of many Greenlandic families living on the Danish mainland who are fighting to get their children returned to them after they were removed by social services.\n\nIn such cases, babies and children were taken away after parental competency tests - known in Denmark as FKUs - were used to help assess whether they were fit to be parents.\n\nIn May this year the Danish government banned the use of these tests on Greenlandic families after decades of criticism, although they continue to be used on other families in Denmark.\n\nThe assessments, which usually take months to complete, are used in complex welfare cases where authorities believe children are at risk of neglect or harm.\n\nThey include interviews with parents and children, a range of cognitive tasks, such as recalling a sequence of numbers backwards, general knowledge quizzes, and personality and emotional testing.\n\nDefenders of the tests say they offer a more objective method of assessment than the potentially anecdotal and subjective evidence of social workers and other experts.\n\nBut critics say they cannot meaningfully predict whether someone will make a good parent.\n\nOpponents have also long argued that they are designed around Danish cultural norms and point out they are administered in Danish, rather than Kalaallisut, the mother tongue of most Greenlanders.\n\nThis can lead to misunderstandings, they say.\n\nGreenlanders are Danish citizens, enabling them to live and work on the mainland.\n\nThousands live in Denmark, drawn by its employment opportunities, education and healthcare, among other reasons.\n\nGreenlandic parents in Denmark are 5.6 times more likely to have children taken into care than Danish parents, according to the Danish Centre for Social Research, a government-funded research institute.\n\nIn May, the government said it hoped in due course to review around 300 cases – including ones involving FKU tests – in which Greenlandic children were forcibly removed from their families.\n\nBut as of October, the BBC found that just 10 cases where parenting tests were used had been reviewed by the government - and no Greenlandic children had been returned as a result.\n\nKeira's assessment in 2024, carried out when she was pregnant, concluded that she did not have \"sufficient parental competencies to care for the newborn independently\".\n\nKeira says the questions she was asked included: \"Who is Mother Teresa?\" and \"How long does it take for the sun's rays to reach the Earth?\"\n\nPsychologists who defend the tests argue questions like these are intended to assess parents' general knowledge and their understanding of concepts they might encounter in society.\n\nKeira adds that \"they made me play with a doll and criticised me for not making enough eye contact\".\n\nShe alleges that when she asked why she was being tested in this way the psychologist told her: \"To see if you are civilised enough, if you can act like a human being.\"\n\nThe local authority in Keira's case said it could not comment on individual families, adding that decisions to place a child in care were made when there was serious concern about the \"child's health, development, and well-being\".\n\nIn 2014, Keira's other two children - who were then aged nine years and eight months - were placed into care after an FKU test at the time concluded her parenting skills were not developing fast enough to meet their needs.\n\nHer eldest, Zoe, who is now 21, moved back home when she was 18 and currently lives in her own apartment and sees her mum regularly.\n\nKeira hopes she will soon be reunited with her baby Zammi permanently.\n\nThe Danish government has said its review will look at whether mistakes were made in the administering of FKU tests on Greenlandic people.\n\nIn the meantime, Keira is allowed to see Zammi, who is in foster care, once a week for an hour.\n\nEach time she visits, she takes flowers and sometimes Greenlandic food, such as chicken heart soup.\n\n\"Just so a little part of her culture can be with her,\" she says.\n\nBut not all Greenlandic parents who had children taken into care after completing FKUs will have their cases reviewed.\n\nJohanne and Ulrik's son was adopted in 2020 and the Danish government has said it will not review cases where children have been adopted.\n\nJohanne, 43, was tested in 2019 during pregnancy.\n\nLike Zammi, her son was meant to have been taken away immediately after birth.\n\nBut because he was born prematurely on Boxing Day and social workers were on holiday, she and her husband Ulrik got to keep him for 17 days.\n\n\"It was the happiest time of my life as a father,\" says Ulrik, 57.\n\n\"Being with my son, holding him, changing his nappy, making sure that Johanne pumps her milk before going to bed in the evening.\"\n\nThen one day, two social workers and two police officers arrived at Johanne and Ulrik's home to take their son away.\n\nThe couple say they pleaded with them not to take him.\n\nJohanne asked if she could breastfeed him one last time.\n\n\"As I was dressing my son to hand him over to his foster parents who were on their way, I felt the most horrific heartbreak,\" Ulrik says.\n\nJohanne had been tested after two children from another relationship, who were five and six, were taken into care after FKU testing in 2010.\n\nHer 2019 assessment describes her as \"narcissistic\" and as having \"mental retardation\" - a categorisation based on designations developed by the WHO which were in use at the time.\n\nShe rejects both of these descriptions of her.\n\nIn theory, there is no pass or fail mark for an FKU and they are one factor among others taken into consideration by local authorities who decide whether to place a child into care.\n\nBut psychologist Isak Nellemann, who used to administer the tests, says in practice they \"are very important, about the most important thing, because when the tests are bad, in about 90% [of cases] they will lose their children\".\n\nNelleman argues the tests lack scientific validity and were developed to study personality traits rather than predict parenting ability.\n\nHowever, Turi Frederiksen, a senior psychologist whose team currently administers the tests, defends them, saying that while they are not perfect, \"they are valuable, extensive psychological tools\".\n\nShe also says she does not believe they are biased against Greenlanders.\n\nWhen Johanne was asked in 2019 what she saw during a Rorschach test - a psychological test where people are asked what they see when looking at ink-blot images - she said she saw a woman gutting a seal, a familiar sight in Greenland's hunting culture.\n\nJohanne alleges that on hearing this answer the psychologist called her a \"barbarian\".\n\nThe local council involved in the couple's 2019 assessment did not address Johanne's claim directly.\n\nThey said her assessment \"indicated significant concern regarding the parents' overall parenting abilities\" as well as \"concerns about the parents' general lifestyle and functional level in daily life\".\n\nAfter Johanne and Ulrik's son was taken into care, they were allowed to see him during brief, weekly visits until he was adopted in 2020.\n\nThey have never seen him since.\n\n\"I never got to see his first steps, his first word, his first tooth, his first school day,\" Johanne says.\n\nHowever, a few days after his birth they christened him, creating an official record that includes their names and address.\n\n\"We needed to create a paper trail so he could find his way back to us,\" Johanne says.\n\nTheir lawyer Jeanette Gjørret hopes to take their case before the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nBut Denmark's social affairs minister Sophie Hæstorp Andersen tells the BBC the government will not reopen cases of adoption because each of these children is now settled with a \"loving and caring family\".\n\nAsked about the progress of the review, she says \"it sounds slow, but we are getting started\".\n\nShe also says decisions to remove and adopt children are part of a \"very thorough process where we look into the family's ability to take care of their child not only for a year or two, but for a long period of time\".\n\nThat is echoed by Tordis Jacobsen, a social worker team leader in Aalborg Kommune in northern Denmark, who says removing a child in Denmark is never taken lightly.\n\nShe says safeguarding concerns are often first flagged by schools or hospitals, and points out that in cases where a child is permanently adopted the decision to approve this is made by a judge.\n\nPilinguaq is a rare case of a Greenlandic mother who has been reunited with her child.\n\nShe and her daughter, who was placed into care aged one, were reunited a few months ago. Her daughter is now six.\n\nPilinguaq, 39, says she received the unexpected news in a phone call from social services.\n\n\"I started crying and laughing at the same time. I couldn't believe it. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God, she's coming home.'\"\n\nPilinguaq's three children were all placed into care in 2021. The other two were aged six and nine at the time.\n\nShe says she agreed for her local authority to place her children in temporary care while she found a new home suitable for her children.\n\nPilinguaq says she believed her children would soon be returned to her, but instead she had to undergo a parenting assessment.\n\nThis concluded she had a pattern of entering \"dysfunctional relationships\" and was unfit to parent.\n\nA few months after her six-year-old daughter came home, Pilinguaq was told by her local authority that her other two older children will be returning to her in December.\n\nThe decision to return the children into Pilinguaq's care was made by the local authority rather than being recommended by the government review. The local authority declined to comment on her case.\n\nSpending more than four years apart has made it difficult for Pilinguaq to rebuild her relationship with her daughter.\n\n\"If I go to the bathroom and close the door, she will have a panic attack and say 'Mum, I couldn't find you,'\" Pilinguaq says.\n\nShe also says she is terrified of losing her daughter again.\n\n\"They can take her in one hour. They can do it again.\"\n\nKeira is now preparing for Zammi's first birthday in her absence.\n\nShe's building a traditional Greenlandic sleigh by hand from wood, with a polar bear drawn on the front.\n\nEarlier this month, she was told that her daughter won't be coming home - for now at least - but she hasn't given up hope.\n\nKeira still has a cot next to her bed and another in the living room, with framed photos of Zammi on the walls, along with baby clothes and nappies.\n\n\"I will not stop fighting for my children.\n\n\"If I don't finish this fight, it will be my children's fight in the future.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:35:12.780+00:00","title":"Where are US military planes and ships stationed near Venezuela?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has significantly increased its military presence near Venezuela, including the deployment of major assets like the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, F-35 fighter jets, B-52 bombers, and surveillance aircraft such as the P-8 Poseidon.

warships and planes involved in the military build-up so far.\n\nThe build-up in the Caribbean began in August with the deployment of air and naval forces, including a nuclear-powered submarine and spy planes  according to US officials.\n\nIt now includes a range of aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nBBC Verify

This is the US Special Operations Command mothership which can serve as a base for 200 troops and has hangar bays for several helicopters.\n\nThe US has also deployed  F-35 fighter jets to its bases in the Caribbean , and has flown bombers and spy planes over the region.\n\nBBC Verify used flight tracking data to identify four US military aircraft flying near Venezuela on 20 and 21 November.\n\nA US B-52 long-range bomber briefly appeared on flight tracking website Flightradar24 off Guyana - Venezuela's eastern neighbour - at around 23:45 GMT (19:45 local time) on 20 November.\n\nThe data shows the bomber - call sign TIMEX11 - departed from the US state of North Dakota that afternoon and landed back there the following morning.\n\nA US Air Force surveillance aircraft - call sign ALBUS39 - appeared on flight-tracking data just after 22:00 GMT (18:00 local time) on 20 November, flying for about two hours near the eastern coast of Venezuela.\n\nAround a similar time a US Navy Super Hornet fighter jet - call sign FELIX11 - was seen circling off the western coast.\n\nAnd a US Air Force refuelling tanker - call sign PYRO33 - was also over the southern Caribbean around 01:30 GMT (21:30 local time) on 21 November.

While Dmitriev claims to be committed to peaceful dialogue and diplomacy, his close ties to Putin's inner circle — including his wife’s connections to Putin’s daughter Katerina Tikhonova — and his role in funding the Sputnik V vaccine raise serious concerns.

diplomat.\n\nAt 50 he is relatively young and he has a deep understanding of the US, having studied and worked there for several years.\n\nHe is also a man of commerce, as head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and a good fit for his opposite number in the Trump administration, special envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nDmitriev now finds himself under the spotlight over a draft peace plan that emerged after he spent three days with Witkoff in Miami.\n\nHis team has refused to comment on its proposals, which read like a Putin wishlist, requiring Ukraine to cede territory under its control and slash the size of its military.\n\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to reject its terms, but says any deal must bring a \"dignified peace, with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty\".\n\nPutin's special envoy understands modern Ukraine better than most in Moscow. He was brought up in Ukraine, and a friend claims that as a 15-year-old Dmitriev took part in pro-democracy protests in Kyiv before the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe has been a fixture of US-Russian diplomatic initiatives pretty much since the start of Trump's second presidency - and Steve Witkoff has been a regular counterpart.\n\n\"We are sure we are on the road to peace, and as peacemakers we need to make it happen,\" Dmitriev told a conference in Saudi Arabia in late October.\n\nThe pair appear to have first crossed paths in February 2025 when Putin's envoy played a role in securing the release of an American teacher from a Russian jail.\n\n\"There's a gentleman from Russia, his name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.\n\nDays later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.\n\nDmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off.\n\nWhen Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.\n\nUnlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio. He is careful to praise Trump's diplomatic skills while giving Western viewers the Russian government narrative in their own language.\n\n\"I'm not a military guy… but the position of [the] Russian military is they only hit military targets,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper recently, days after a kindergarten was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \"I'm just working to have dialogue and make sure that the conflict is ended as soon as possible.\"\n\nDmitriev certainly is not a military guy, he's a private investment specialist with an eye for a deal.\n\nWitkoff may rate him, but in 2022 during Joe Biden's presidency,  the US Treasury called him a \"known Putin ally\"   and imposed sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which he has run since 2011.\n\n\"While officially a sovereign wealth fund, RDIF is widely considered a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and is emblematic of Russia's broader kleptocracy,\" it said.\n\nDmitriev's attitude to the Biden years is pretty clear: under Biden there was no attempt to understand the Russian position, he argues, while Trump's team stopped World War Three.\n\nIt is claimed that Dmitriev has accumulated a real estate fortune with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.\n\nPopova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.\n\nHis rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.\n\nThat scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.\n\nDmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.\n\nWhile Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.\n\nHis relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"\n\nHe later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".\n\nAfter earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.\n\nDmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.\n\nBy 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nIncreasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.\n\nHe was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.\n\nHis overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.\n\nThe Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.\n\nMuch of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity.\n\nHe proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.\n\nHe has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.\n\nDmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where  sanctions have been imposed on him  for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4qx1lenvjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"04:12:35.720+00:00","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene to quit Congress after Trump feud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent Republican congresswoman from Georgia and a key ally of Donald Trump, has announced her resignation from Congress effective January 5, 2026, following a public feud over the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents.

Congress after Trump feud\n\nGeorgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican days after a public feud with President Donald Trump.\n\nGreene, who was one of Trump's Maga superstars in US politics, posted a video statement on social media announcing she would leave Congress on 5 January 2026.\n\nThe Republican was one of Trump's staunchest defenders in Congress, but her relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein led to a bitter public falling out with the president, who has since labelled her a \"traitor\".\n\n\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better,\" she said in the video.\n\nTrump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, responded to her resignation by calling it \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.\n\nGreene said in the announcement that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\n\nShe had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has become divisive.\n\nTrump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\n\n\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter.\n\nOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down costs for voters and criticised his tariff policies. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.\n\nTrump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.\n\nDays after their feud boiled over, Trump reversed course and said he would support the release of files related to Epstein. He signed off on a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days.\n\nGreene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.\n\nIn the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\".\n\nWhile she announced her departure from the House of Representatives, reports in US media have indicated Greene has shown an interest in running for state office - either as Georgia governor or for a Senate seat.\n\nThe president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling.\n\nGreene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices.\n\nBefore their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden.\n\nHer departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, who only hold a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4qxvy74qyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"01:50:11.209+00:00","title":"Niger state kidnapping: More than 200 pupils abducted from catholic school","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mass kidnapping of over 200 students and 12 staff members occurred at St Mary's Catholic School in Papiri, Niger state, Nigeria, on Friday, marking the second major school abduction in a week.

a Catholic school in central Nigeria on Friday, the second mass school kidnapping this week.\n\nThe latest attack targeted St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state, where authorities had already ordered the temporary closure of all boarding schools due to rising security threats.\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria said 215 students and 12 members of staff were taken during the early morning raid.\n\nNigeria has faced a renewed wave of attacks by armed groups in recent days, including the kidnapping on Monday of more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, from a boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state.\n\nA church was also attacked further south, in Kwara state, with two people killed and 38 abducted while the service was being broadcast online.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu has postponed his foreign trips - including this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address these security issues.\n\nPolice said armed men - locally known as bandits - stormed St Mary's School on Friday at about 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and abducted students from their hostel.\n\nFear and uncertainty have gripped the area as families wait for news.\n\n\"Everybody is weak... it took everybody by surprise,\" local resident Dominic Adamu told the BBC.\n\nMr Adamu, whose daughters attend St Mary's School but were not abducted, added: \"People are complaining about the state of security in our country.\"\n\nOne distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13 were kidnapped.\n\n\"I just want them to come home,\" she said.\n\nThe authorities in Niger state said the school, attended by both girls and boys, had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks.\n\n\"Regrettably, St Mary's School proceeded to reopen and resume academic activities without notifying or seeking clearance from the state government, thereby exposing pupils and the staff to avoidable risk,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThe school has not commented on that claim.\n\nThe police said that security agencies were \"combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students\".\n\nThe attack follows claims by US President Donald Trump that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria, an allegation dismissed by the Nigerian government.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".\n\nAnd on Thursday, in a meeting with Nigeria's national security advisor, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Nigeria to take \"urgent and enduring action to stop violence against Christians\", a statement from the Pentagon said.\n\nHegseth also conveyed the US' will to \"work by, with, and through Nigeria to deter and degrade terrorists that threaten the United States\".\n\nThe Nigerian government denies that Christians are being persecuted, saying that is \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".\n\nAn official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".\n\nNigeria is currently grappling with multiple overlapping security crises.\n\nThe country's 220 million people are roughly evenly split between followers of the two religions, with Muslims in the majority in the north.\n\nThe kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of the country.\n\nIn the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade. Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the north.\n\nIn the centre of the country, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders, who are mostly Muslim, on farmers, who are largely Christian. However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources such as water or land, rather than religion.\n\nLocal media report that the kidnappers have demanded a ransom for those abducted from the church in Eruku, Kwara state.\n\nThe payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs but to little effect.\n\nTwo of the schoolgirls abducted on Monday in Maga, Kebbi state  have managed to escape , while 23 are still missing. Two people were killed in that attack. They were both Muslim.\n\nAdditional reporting by Abayomi Adisa in Lagos & Wedaeli Chibelushi in London\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz68x1n5qd6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"21:05:30.710+00:00","title":"Grizzly bear on loose after attacking school group in Canada, injuring 11","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grizzly bear attacked a school group on a walking trail in Bella Coola, British Columbia, on Thursday afternoon, injuring 11 people, including two who were critically injured.

They smiled often, and Trump even appeared amused as reporters asked him about the political attacks Mamdani had fired his way.\n\nThe tone of the meeting appeared to strike political observers off guard, but offered a signal that both men understand that tackling the affordability crisis is critical to their political success.\n\nWhether the truce will last once Mamdani takes office on 1 January remains to be seen.\n\nUntil then, \"I'll be cheering for him,\" Trump said.\n\nThe rapport was evident from the moment they started speaking to the press.\n\nFacing the media after a private meeting, Mamdani stood to Trump's right with his hands clasped, as the president sat behind the Resolute Desk. Their body language was relaxed – particularly Trump's.\n\nNot only did Trump refrain from attacking Mamdani, he praised him numerous times.\n\nThe president expressed hope that Mamdani would be a \"really great mayor\".\n\nLater, the president added he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\".\n\nMamdani and Trump traded political barbs throughout the mayoral election. A reporter in the room on Friday reminded the two men that Trump had called Mamdani a \"communist\" and Mamdani had referred to the president as a \"despot\".\n\nBoth men deflected multiple questions about their previous statements and pivoted back to praise.\n\nTrump even let Mamdani answer a question about whether the mayor-elect thought the president was a \"fascist\".\n\n\"That's ok, you can just say yes,\" Trump interjected, giving Mamdani a light tap on the arm and smiling. \"It's easier than explaining.\"\n\nThe closest Trump came to criticising Mamdani's politics was telling reporters, \"He's got views that are little out there\".\n\nPerhaps most striking, Trump dismisssed a question echoing an attack on Mamdani by one of Trump's top political allies in New York.\n\n\"Do you think you're standing next to a 'jihadist' right now in the oval office?\" a reporter asked, quoting Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who is mounting a run for governor of New York.\n\n\"No I don't,\" Trump quickly said.\n\n\"You say things sometimes in a campaign,\" Trump said of Stefanik. \"She's a very capable person.\"\n\nMamdani and Trump have something in common: they're both New Yorkers, and both have called the borough of Queens home.\n\nTrump's childhood home is in the neighbourhood of Jamaica Estates, while Mamdani currently resides in Astoria.\n\nThe two had a \"shared love\" of the city, Mamdani said.\n\nThough Trump rarely spends time in his namesake Manhattan skyscraper these days, he spoke fondly of his hometown throughout the news conference.\n\n\"This city could be unbelievable - if he could be a spectacular success, I'll be very happy,\" Trump said.\n\nAt one point, the president suggested that in a different political lifetime, he would have liked to be mayor of New York himself.\n\nPerhaps part of the reason the two men appeared in lock step on Friday was their shared focus on cost-of-living issues.\n\nTrump won re-election last year after relentlessly hammering the issue of high inflation that had frustrated voters in 2024. As consumers grow restless about the cost of groceries, housing, and other essentials, Trump has tried to convey a message of economic stability.\n\nDuring his election campaign in New York City, Mamdani maintained a laser-focus on the lack of affordable housing and proposed freezing rent increases on certain rent-stabilised apartments, among other initiatives.\n\nMamdani said he and Trump discussed how to \"deliver affordability to New Yorkers\".\n\nWhenever he was asked a question about their differing views, the mayor-elect brought the conversation back to this topic.\n\nFacing one question about their different views on achieving peace in the Middle East, Mamdani responded that Trump voters had expressed to him a wish for \"an end to forever wars\" and for leaders to address \"the cost-of-living crisis\".\n\nOn law enforcement and immigration, they also appeared to find some common ground. Mamdani said he and Trump discussed federal immigration-enforcement operations in New York, and he relayed concerns from residents about how they are being conducted.\n\nBut Trump said they discussed crime more than immigration.\n\n\"He doesn't want to see crime and I don't want to see crime,\" the president said. He had \"very little doubt\" the two would get along on that issue.\n\nTrump even said he would feel safe living in a Mamdani-led New York.\n\nThe cordial relations on display Friday may complicate efforts by Republicans to use the self-described democratic socialist as a bogeyman in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, when control of the US Congress will be up for grabs.\n\nIn elections earlier this month, Republicans struggled and Democrats won key races. It's unclear whether that trend will hold.\n\nRepublicans had plans in place to make Mamdani the face of the Democratic Party, according to US news outlet Axios. They included painting him as anti-police, anti-capitalism and anti-Israel in an effort to give Republicans a leg-up in key races.\n\nBut the Oval Office chuminess could undercut that strategy.\n\nWhile praising Mamdani, the president said he believed the new mayor would \"surprise some conservative people\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:15:11.302+00:00","title":"What we know about leaked US draft plan to end Russia's Ukraine war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked draft US-Russia peace plan proposes that Ukraine cede control of parts of its eastern Donbas region, including key cities like Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, to Russian de facto control, while reducing its armed forces to 600,000 personnel.

to end Russia's Ukraine war\n\nThe draft US-Russia peace plan has been widely leaked and we now know that it proposes to hand over those areas of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the  de facto  control of Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\nLatest versions of the text also call for Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces to 600,000 people.\n\nBut what else is known about the text and who stands to benefit from it most?\n\nThere are 28 key points and there are several on the face of it that could be acceptable to Ukraine. Others come across as vague and imprecise.\n\nUkraine's sovereignty would be \" confirmed\"  and there would be a  \"total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine and Europe\" , with robust or reliable  \"security guarantees\"  for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days.\n\nIf Russia were to invade Ukraine a  \"robust co-ordinated military response\"  is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal.\n\nAlthough elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place, they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed.\n\nBut on security guarantees, there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to  treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.\n\nAmong the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\"\n\nCeding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.\n\n\"The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\"\n\nUkraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nWhile 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.\n\n\"Our red lines are clear and unwavering,\" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: \"There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.\"\n\nThe draft also proposes that \" Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States\" .\n\nIn other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are \" indivisible and inviolable\".\n\nElsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nThe draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:\n\n\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\"\n\n\"Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.\"\n\nThere is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries.\n\nJoining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: \"Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.\"\n\nOther draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a  \"non-nuclear state\".\n\nThat appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.\n\nSeveral points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with  \"Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy\"  and invited back into the G8 group of powers.\n\nThat seems a long way off for now, with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.\n\nIf the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.\n\nThe draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested  \"in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\" , with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.\n\nThe sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).\n\nSome €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.\n\nThe rest of those frozen assets would go to a  \"US-Russian investment vehicle\" , under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.\n\nSeveral commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.\n\nBut it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.\n\nWe know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.\n\nEqually US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as \"a list of potential ideas for ending this war\", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nIn some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent.\n\nThe European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.\n\nRussian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow. Russia's response has so far been cautious but Putin has said it  could be the \"basis\" for a peace settlement .\n\nThe handover of Ukrainian territory to Russia, even in a demilitarised zone, is the biggest sign of a slant towards Russia's narrative, but freezing the front lines in the south could prove difficult for the Kremlin which has annexed both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in its constitution.\n\nOne of the proposals is for the lifting of sanctions to be  \"agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis\"  - which Moscow will probably see as far too slow.\n\nHowever, a plan for a  \"full amnesty\"  for all parties will go down well in Moscow and very badly in Kyiv and European capitals.\n\nCommentators have pointed out that while there do appear to be major concessions to Putin, some of the requirements for Nato might be too vague for Kremlin tastes.\n\nRussia has also consistently demanded that a peace plan would need to eliminate what it sees as \"the root causes\" of the war. One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.\n\nSome of the other 28 points of the draft also nod to Russia's claims of discrimination against Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them.\n\nOne point is explicit but even-handed:  \"Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\"\n\nAnother apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe -  \"equally between Russia and Ukraine\" ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78z8n3kvnro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"02:07:19.544+00:00","title":"India's blind women cricketers chase history at first T20 World Cup","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India's blind women cricketers made history by winning all five matches in the inaugural Blind Women's T20 Cricket World Cup, qualifying for the semi-finals.

2025-11-22T02:07:19.544+00:00\n\nTitle: India's blind women cricketers chase history at first T20 World Cup\n\nThe ongoing inaugural Blind Women's T20 Cricket World Cup has put the spotlight on visually impaired Indian women who have overcome immense challenges to reach this stage.\n\nThey come from villages, farming families and small-town hostels, with many learning the sport only in the past few years.\n\nThe T20 tournament - a six-team event featuring India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and the USA -  began on 11 November in Delhi. After a few matches in Bengaluru, the venue for the knockouts has now moved to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo.\n\nThe 16-member Indian squad represents nine states - Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Assam, and Bihar. Many players were introduced to the sport through schoolteachers, disability organisations, or community camps.\n\n\"Most of the players are from rural backgrounds,\" said team manager Shika Shetty. \"Language and culture were barriers, families and teachers were often unwilling to let them pursue the sport, and even introducing the rules of blind cricket took time. But now they are all competing with pride.\"\n\nBlind cricket uses a plastic ball with metal bearings that makes a sound, and players are classified depending on their level of visual impairment. Players are classified as B1, B2 or B3, based on vision, and teams must include a mix of all three. The ball jingles and is bowled underarm along the pitch. B1 players, who are fully blind, bat with runners for safety, and each run they complete counts as two.\n\nThe World Cup features six teams in a single round-robin. India won all five matches and were the first side to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nIndia's team is captained by Deepika TC, a Karnataka native who lost her sight as a baby after an accident. She grew up in a farming family, unaware that sport would define her life.\n\nCricket reached her through specialised schools, where teachers encouraged her to try the game despite her hesitation. Over time, the sport gave her direction and confidence, she says.\n\nLeading India in the World Cup carries deep meaning for her.\n\n\"This is the biggest moment of my and my team's life. Earlier this month, the sighted Indian women's cricket team won the World Cup in Navi Mumbai, and we want to make it a double this month,\" Deepika said.\n\nShe said support from Indian women's World Cup winner Jemimah Rodrigues and men's Test captain Shubman Gill had been very meaningful.\n\nVice-captain Ganga Kadam of Maharashtra, from a family of nine siblings, was enrolled in a school for the blind by her farmer father to secure a stable future.\n\nShe played cricket casually until a mentor urged her to take it seriously. Learning to trust sound, timing, and orientation was challenging. The 26-year-old's progress came through persistence rather than immediate results, and she now inspires visually impaired girls in her village to play sports.\n\nAnother on the team, top-order batter Anekha Devi, 20, from Jammu and Kashmir, was born partially blind. Her uncle, also visually impaired, urged her to attend a blind cricket camp in Delhi after school.\n\nShe remembers early sessions as overwhelming, with unfamiliar voices and techniques. But she adapted quickly and surprised coaches with her grasp of the audible ball system.\n\nWithin two years she reached the national team and often speaks of wanting to become the role model she never had for herself.\n\nHer 18-year-old all-rounder teammate, Phula Saren, from a tribal community in Odisha, lost vision in her left eye at five, as well as her mother soon after. She discovered cricket through a teacher at a school for the blind.\n\nTravelling to tournaments was challenging, and persuading her family took time, but she persisted. Her turning point wasn't a trophy -  it was realising she belonged at the national level.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunita Sarathe from Madhya Pradesh didn't step into cricket directly from school. She completed college, explored various jobs, and only joined a blind cricket camp on a friend's recommendation.\n\nThe sport felt \"fast and complicated\", but she kept returning. Coaches say she trained intensely because she felt she had joined \"late\". She is now one of India's most reliable fielders.\n\nHeadquartered in London, the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) has overseen the sport since 1996. While the men's game has a longer history -  with the first 50-over World Cup in 1998 and the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2012 - this year marks the first-ever women's Blind Cricket World Cup.\n\nIndia's women's blind cricket setup is still young. The Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI), which governs blind cricket nationally, was established in 2011. Systematic scouting for a women's team began in 2019, leading to their first international match in 2023 and a gold medal at the IBSA World Games in Birmingham the same year.\n\n\"We believed we were doing injustice by not giving visually impaired women the same opportunities as the men,\" said Mahantesh GK, CABI's chairperson.\n\n\"Creating this tournament took huge effort. Money was a challenge. Getting teams was a challenge. But we persisted. Now the response from both the central and many state governments, sponsors, the corporate world and the public has been remarkable. The future will be much bigger.\"\n\nThe semifinals and final of the World Cup will be held in Colombo, with the final set for Sunday. All matches are streamed live on CABI's YouTube channel and state-run Prasar Bharati platforms, while India's games are also broadcast on national broadcaster Doordarshan, giving the sport a major visibility boost.\n\n\"As more countries field women's teams, the standard and global footprint for women's blind cricket will rise quickly,\" Mr Mahantesh says.\n\nCoach Shetty believes the visibility will change how families respond to girls entering the sport.\n\n\"Now that people have watched these matches on livestreams and seen these women perform, families will feel more confident about allowing their daughters to play. It will not feel like an unknown path anymore.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdege0k962do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"03:32:39.329+00:00","title":"The Christian converts the US is deporting back to Iran","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the deportation of Iranian Christian converts to Iran by US immigration authorities, despite prior asylum rulings, raising serious concerns about the fairness and consistency of the asylum system.

officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas.\n\nThey told him simply to \"pack up\" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.\n\nMajid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.\n\nWhen US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.\n\nMajid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.\n\nTheir experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".\n\nA White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported have had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.\n\nAs the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers. In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.\n\nDozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.\n\nAmong the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.\n\n\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"\n\nFor Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.\n\nAttorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.\n\nConverts from Islam make up a significant share of Iran's 800, 000 Christian population, says Steve Dew-Jones of Article 18, a UK-based advocacy group that monitors violations against Christians in the country.\n\nWith officially recognised churches tightly restricted,  house churches  have begun to emerge across the country. But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.\n\nConverting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.\n\nArrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.\n\nSome Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.\n\nBut it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.\n\n\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"\n\nAsylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.\n\nIn late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles. In video filmed by their pastor, Marjan is seen collapsed outside as agents detain her husband. Moments earlier she had called him pleading for help. The couple - both Christian converts from Iran who had applied for asylum in the US - were taken to separate detention centres. Weeks later, their cases diverged: Marjan was granted asylum in California, while Reza, held in New Mexico, was ordered to be removed to a third country.\n\nAfter their June arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said on its X account that \"during a targeted enforcement operation in Los Angeles, Border Patrol agent apprehended two Iranian nationals unlawfully present in the US - both flagged as subjects of national security interest.\"\n\nPastor Ara Torosian, who filmed their arrest, disputes the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the couple were unlawfully present in the US.\n\nHe says they entered legally through a humanitarian programme and had work authorisations. \"How can it be dangerous for the wife but not for the husband?\" asks pastor, Ara Torosian, who himself fled Iran in 2010 after being detained for smuggling Bibles.\n\nMajid, who managed to slip through the airport in Turkey, has been living in limbo since, while his lawyer follows up on his case. His wife, whose asylum case is still pending, now lives in Los Angeles with their 1.5-year-old daughter - a child who has never met her father.\n\nIn the US, Ali is living with a friend from his church, and hoping his own asylum claim will be more successful than that of his wife, who was deported to Iran this year.\n\n\"If they grant me asylum, how can I stay here when my wife is in Iran? If they deport me, I could go to prison the moment I land.\"\n\nUnable to work legally or open a bank account. He first stayed with a distant relative \"just until my wife's case was resolved,\" but she was never released and, after nearly a year in detention, was deported. A small church later offered him temporary shelter.\n\n\"Anytime they ask me to leave, I have to sleep in parks,\" he says.\n\nHe is awaiting an immigration hearing but sees no good outcome. His wife has received another summons from Iranian intelligence.\n\n\"If they arrest her and demand I return,\" he says quietly, \"I'll have no choice.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqlqjz30zxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"22:01:24.821+00:00","title":"Family of missing Colombian seek answers after US strike on alleged drug boat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the growing controversy surrounding US military strikes in the Caribbean targeting alleged drug-trafficking vessels, with a central focus on the case of Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman from Gaira who is believed to have been killed in a strike on 15 September 2025.

A good father, uncle, son. He was a cheerful person. He loved his work and his fishing.\"\n\nAlejandro Carranza said goodbye to his family early in the morning on 14 September, before going out on his boat as usual, his cousin Audenis Manjarres told state media. He left from La Guajira, a region in neighbouring Venezuela, he said.\n\nThe next day, US President Donald Trump announced that a US strike in international waters had targeted a vessel which had departed Venezuela, and that three people he described as \"extraordinarily violent drug-trafficking cartels and narco-terrorists\" were killed.\n\nMs Perez has not seen her uncle since. His five children are missing their dad, she says, and the family are still waiting anxiously for answers, not knowing if he was even on the boat hit in the strike.\n\n\"The truth is we don't know it was him, we don't have any proof that it was him, apart from what we saw on the news.\"\n\nThe US began striking alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean in September, before expanding the operation to the Pacific. So far 83 people have been killed in at least 21 strikes, according to US statements.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth says that the campaign is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nThe Trump administration justifies them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives by stopping drugs from entering the US.\n\nBut the strikes have attracted condemnation in countries in the region and concern that they breach international law.\n\nColombia's President Gustavo Petro has criticised the strikes, saying Colombian citizens were on board the boat hit on 15 September, and later claiming Mr Carranza was among those killed.\n\nResponding to his first statement about Colombian citizens being killed, the White House said it looked forward to President Petro \"publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement\".\n\nTrump has also accused Petro of encouraging the production of drugs and threated to cut off US aid to Colombia.\n\nMr Carranza comes from a huge family, living with about 20 relatives in a small house off a dirt track in the fishing village of Gaira.\n\nEarlier this month, Petro  alleged  that he wanted to help his daughter study at university, and so accepted a payment from a drug trafficker to transport some drugs to an island, when his boat was struck.\n\n\"But whether it was fish or cocaine [he was transporting], he wasn't subject to the death penalty,\" Petro said. He accused the US of \"murder\" and since said he ordered Colombian public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with the US until the strikes end. His defence minister later said the president had given \"clear instructions to maintain, as has been done, a continuous flow of information with international agencies to combat drug trafficking\".\n\nMr Carranza has a past criminal record over stealing weapons from the police nine years ago, but his family deny – and say they are hurt by – characterisations of him as a narco-trafficker.\n\n\"What the president of the United States is doing isn't right. He has to prove if they are or aren't [trafficking],\" Lizbeth says.\n\nShe says while Trump may want to tackle issues affecting his \"territory\" that \"doesn't mean he should resort to these methods… of taking someone's life\".\n\nA US lawyer working for some of Mr Carranza's family, Daniel Kovalik, who also works for President Petro, says Mr Carranza's wife and older daughter recognised his boat from the US-released footage of the strike.\n\nHe intends to sue the US government on the family's behalf. International law says the military cannot kill civilians unless they pose an imminent threat of violence, even if engaging in criminal activity.\n\n\"Even if you claim that the people you're killing are trafficking drugs, you don't have the right to just engage in extrajudicial killings,\" Mr Kovalik said.\n\n\"They're tiny boats… If you really believe they were doing something wrong, those people should be arrested, tried in a court of law, convicted, and sentenced.\"\n\n\"And, by the way, none of them would be sentenced to the death penalty – this is not a capital crime.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has told Congress that it believes the US is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the region.\n\nIn doing so, it appears to be invoking war-time powers, such as killing enemy combatants even if they pose no immediate violent threat, to justify the strikes.\n\nPresident Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have said the US is \"under threat\" from \"terrorist organisations\" and said drugs kill thousands of Americans.\n\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says seizures of cocaine – the major drug trafficked and produced in South America – rose by about 18% in 2024 compared to the previous year.\n\nBut the main driver of drug deaths in the US is Fentanyl, which is produced and arrives in the US from Mexico.\n\nMr Kovalik does not buy the US's self-defence argument, saying \"these boats have never attacked the United States\".\n\nBack in Taganga, the strikes are causing apprehension for fishermen like 81-year-old Juan Assis Tejeda, whose skin is tanned and leathered from 70 years fishing these waters under the Caribbean's baking sun – just like his grandfather and father before him.\n\nHe regularly fishes near the border with Venezuela, just along the coast.\n\nHe describes how he has sometimes seen drones flying over them while out fishing that \"hover quietly, come back again, and disappear\".\n\nEven though he is just fishing, he is now fearful because of the ongoing strikes.\n\n\"At any moment they could see us and think we're doing the same thing. Because sometimes we also go 60 miles or so out to sea, looking for tuna.\"\n\nHe says some fishermen do get involved in transporting drugs due to poverty. He says he was once offered money himself, but he said no.\n\nHe would prefer to stick to the little money that he earns and live \"peacefully\" than run the risks associated with transporting drugs, he says.\n\nMost in this region do not believe that this is just about targeting small, alleged drug-trafficking boats, but instead about the US also wanting to put military pressure on Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro to step aside – or on his allies, for example in the military, to oust him.\n\nThe US accuses Maduro of leading a criminal trafficking organisation which it calls the Cartel de los Soles, something Maduro strongly denies. The US state department intends to designate this group a foreign terrorist organisation on Monday.\n\nThis has added to growing speculation over whether the US will strike targets on Venezuelan soil itself.\n\nTrump said the US \"may be having some discussions with Maduro\" and Maduro responded by saying he would be prepared to talk \"face to face\".\n\nAs the US mulls its next move, the sleepy fishing villages that dot the Caribbean coast wonder whether diplomacy, or war, is on their horizon."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4yk4nv5yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"02:13:52.435+00:00","title":"Cold plunges and kombucha: Do winter wellness trends work?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article evaluates popular winter wellness trends such as cold water swimming, kombucha, vitamin C, and turmeric, finding that while some have psychological or indirect benefits, none provide strong scientific evidence for boosting the immune system.

But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run.\"\n\nBeing in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses.\n\nGP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming.\n\nMany people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.\n\nBut Dr McCartney remains cautious.\n\n\"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients.\"\n\nProfessor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.\n\nDr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present \"interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome\", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system.\n\nVitamin C has long been sold as a winter essential, but according to Dr McCartney, the evidence simply isn't strong enough to recommend it when it comes to fighting off colds.\n\nShe says the same goes for multi-vitamins which do very little beyond giving you \"expensive urine\".\n\nHowever, Vitamin D is slightly different as \"there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections\".\n\nBut, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people \"with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases\" who will likely benefit.\n\nMany people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help.\n\nThe likes of turmeric shots, ginger drinks and fancy nasal sprays do nothing to boost your immune system, according to Dr McCartney.\n\nProfessor Tregoning says that a nasal spray can help with a blocked nose but all you need is a simple saline spray which is just salt and water.\n\n\"The solution can dilute the blocked nose, stimulate turnover of mucus and relieve inflammation.\"\n\nAll three experts agree that ultimately only one intervention can strengthen the immune system and that's vaccination.\n\nProfessor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.\n\nWhile you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress.\n\nDr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in well ventilated spaces and washing your hands regularly and properly."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5g4r9l4dlo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"23:49:57.421+00:00","title":"Zelensky warns Ukraine risks losing US support over White House peace plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a stark warning that Kyiv risks losing vital US support over a controversial White House peace plan that includes territorial concessions, a significant reduction in Ukraine’s military size, and a pledge to renounce NATO membership.

Zelensky, in a national address, stressed the need for unity and national interest, asserting that Ukraine will offer alternatives to the plan.

Ukraine risks losing US support over White House peace plan\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Kyiv risks losing US support over a White House plan on how to end the war with Russia.\n\nAddressing the nation on Friday, Zelensky said Ukraine \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\", adding that \"today is one of the most difficult moments in our history\".\n\nThe widely leaked US peace plan includes proposals that Kyiv had previously ruled out: ceding eastern areas it now controls, significantly cutting its army size, and pledging not to join Nato.\n\nThese provisions are seen as heavily slanted towards Russia, whose President Vladimir Putin said the plan could be a \"basis\" for peace settlement.\n\nAt Friday's meeting with his security cabinet, Putin said Moscow had received the plan, which had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail. He said Russia was willing to \"show flexibility\" but was also prepared to fight on.\n\nLater in the day, US President Donald Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the plan, adding that otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.\n\nUkraine is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn his 10-minute address in front of the presidential office in Kyiv, Zelensky warned that Ukraine would face \"a lot of pressure... to weaken us, to divide us\", adding that \"the enemy is not sleeping\".\n\nUrging Ukrainians to stay united, he stressed that the country's \"national interest must be taken into account\".\n\n\"We're not making loud statements,\" he went on, \"we'll be calmly working with America and all the partners... offering alternatives\" to the proposed peace plan.\n\nZelensky also said he had been reassured of continuous support during a phone call with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\n\nSir Keir said late on Friday that Ukraine's allies remained committed to securing \"a just and lasting peace once and for all\".\n\nAhead of  the G20 summit, which begins on Saturday in South Africa , the prime minister said he and other world leaders would \"discuss the current proposal on the table, and in support of President Trump's push for peace, look at how we can strengthen this plan for the next phase of negotiations\".\n\nTrump is not attending the gathering over widely discredited claims that white people are being persecuted in the country.\n\nSeparately, Zelensky said he had spoken \"for almost an hour\" with US Vice-President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, adding that Ukraine \"always respected\" Trump's efforts to end the war.\n\nIn Washington, Trump warned that Ukraine would lose more territory to Russia \"in a short amount of time\".\n\nHe said it was \"appropriate\" to give Ukraine until 27 November - Thanksgiving in the US - to agree to the peace deal, but added deadlines could be extended if things were \"going well\".\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Friday, the US president said \"we think we have a way of getting peace\", adding that Zelensky \"is going to have to approve it\".\n\nWashington has been pressing Kyiv to quickly accept the plan, and sent senior Pentagon officials to the Ukrainian capital earlier this week.\n\nOn Thursday, Putin sounded determined to continue the war despite reported heavy Russian combat casualties.\n\n\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader, wearing a military uniform, told his army commanders. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation [full-scale war].\"\n\nThe 28-point US peace plan emerged as Russia claims small territorial gains in south-eastern Ukraine, while Zelensky faces a domestic crisis implicating top officials in a $100m (£76m) corruption scandal.\n\nThe White House has pushed back on claims that Ukraine was frozen out of the drafting of the proposal, following meetings between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nAn unnamed US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the plan was drawn up \"immediately\" following discussions with Ukraine's top security official Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of it.\n\nUmerov is said to have made several modifications before he presented it to Zelensky.\n\nThe leaked draft proposes Ukrainian troops' withdrawal from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nThe plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.\n\nThe US plan also limits Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.\n\nKyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.\n\nThe draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.\n\nUkrainians both under and free of Russian occupation struck a defiant tone in reaction to news of the US proposal.\n\nIn Kyiv, the widow of a Ukrainian soldier told the BBC: \"This is not a peace plan, it is a plan to continue the war.\"\n\nAnother person speaking from one of the occupied territories in Ukraine told the BBC: \"I'm trying to keep my sanity here in the conditions of constant propaganda that Ukraine has forgotten us. I hope they will not sign this.\"\n\nRussia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory and its troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line, despite reported heavy losses."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:31:04-05:00","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene Says She Plans to Resign in January","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-right Republican representative from Georgia, announced her resignation from Congress on November 21, 2025, with her final day set for January 5, 2026.

rounds, and in the immortal words of Kylie Minogue, you just can't get it out of your head.\n\nBut what if it was created by a robot, or the artist themself is a product of artificial intelligence (AI)? Do streaming sites have an obligation to label music as AI-generated? And does it even matter, if you like what you hear?\n\nA survey published last week  suggested 97% of respondents  could not spot an AI-generated song. But there are some telltale signs - if you know where to look.\n\nHere's a quick guide.\n\nAI music became one of last summer's hottest topics after accusations the band The Velvet Sundown was AI-generated sent them viral.\n\nThe band, who had no record label and a minimal social media footprint, quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of monthly listeners on Spotify after releasing two albums just weeks apart - and the music world grew suspicious.\n\nThe band initially denied the claims, later describing themselves as a synthetic project \"guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced and visualised with the support of artificial intelligence\".\n\nThey claimed the project was an \"artistic provocation\", not a trick, but many fans felt betrayed.\n\nInternet sleuths were suspicious of the band's airbrushed photos, which featured non-descript backgrounds and a warm orange filter.\n\nThere was also no record of them having performed live – no glowing reviews from fans posted online, nor any concert photos or videos. The  band members had not given interviews  and did not appear to have individual social media accounts.\n\nLooking into the real-life and social media presence of an artist can be one helpful indicator of whether or not they are real. But experts tell the BBC that fast-developing, sophisticated technology means it is increasingly hard to know when a song has been made using AI.\n\nStill, while it may be tricky, they say there are signs listeners can be alert to.\n\nWhen LJ Rich started creating AI music around five years ago, she recalls how it could only generate three seconds at a time, taking about 10 hours to create a minute of audio.\n\nNow, an entire song can be summoned rapidly with a single prompt, sparking what industry experts have described as an \"explosion\" of AI music, sometimes referred to as \"slop\" - on streaming platforms.\n\nA song with a formulaic feel - sweet but without much substance or emotional weight - can be a sign of AI, says the musician and technology speaker, as well as vocals that feel breathless.\n\nAI songs tend to stick to generic verse-chorus structures, and usually don't have a satisfying ending. AI is also more likely to create lyrics that follow a correct grammatical structure, says Rich, whereas some of the most beautiful or memorable words penned by humans don't always make sense.\n\nJust ask Alicia Keys and her \"concrete jungle where dreams are made of\", or The Rolling Stones and their flirtation with double negatives in (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\n\n\"If it doesn't feel emotional, it's a really big part,\" the former BBC Click presenter continues. \"Does it create that tension and resolution that is a fundamental part of the music that we love? Does it have a story inside it?\"\n\nAnother tell-tale sign is unrealistic levels of productivity. Professor Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, describes how one artist was recently believed to be AI after dropping multiple soundalike albums simultaneously.\n\nTheir songs resembled a mashup of 80s rock bands – like \"really classic rock hits that had been put in a blender\".\n\n\"This will be fine for background music for most people,\" she continues, \"but it won't work for creating the superstars of the future who, of course, draw on the past but then make something completely new out of it.\"\n\nSometimes, what might stand out is a song that sounds almost too perfect, lacking minor flaws and variances.\n\nThis could mean no strain in the vocals, and overly polished production, according to Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and lecturer in music industry management at the University of Lancashire.\n\nHe adds that odd phrasing, unnatural emotional delivery, and lyrics that feel generic or repetitive can also be clues.\n\n\"AI hasn't felt heartbreak yet... It knows patterns,\" he explains. \"What makes music human is not just sound but the stories behind it.\"\n\nIt's also worth paying close attention to the vocals. AI \"singers\" often sound a little slurred. Consonants and plosives (hard sounds like \"p\" and \"t\") aren't quite right. You might hear \"ghost\" harmonies, where backing vocals appear and disappear at random.\n\nHowever, Rigg calls these signs \"hints not proof\", acknowledging it is not very easy for the casual listener to detect AI-generated songs.\n\nAs well as being used to generate full songs, AI is also becoming a tool some established artists are using to support their creativity.\n\nThere currently isn't any obligation – or consistent way – for artists to let fans know if and how they are using AI.\n\nSome are very open:  the Beatles, for example, used machine learning  to extract the voice of John Lennon from a 1970s cassette recording to release what they called their \"last song\", Now and Then, in 2023.\n\nAnd artists including Imogen Heap and Timbaland have created AI personas and released singles under their names.\n\nLast month, Heap released the song Aftercare with her AI model ai.Mogen, trained on her voice.\n\nShe created the voice model as a chatbot - a \"desperate attempt\" to keep up with a deluge of messages and requests including from fans - but more recently, it has featured on several songs and allowed Heap to take part in more collaborations than she otherwise would have due to time constraints.\n\nWhile \"it does sound different if you really know my voice\", she says she has put a lot of work into making the AI version of her voice sound human and doesn't think listeners would be able to tell.\n\nHeap isn't trying to mislead listeners –  ai.Mogen is listed as a co-contributor on the track.\n\nBut she hopes if people feel a human connection to the song, without already knowing part of the vocals are sung by her AI model, they might reconsider any preconceived negative ideas or fears they have about AI.\n\n\"I hope that people listen, don't realise, find peace in that,\" she tells the BBC.\n\nShe says she isn't against using AI to actually create music, but it's just not something she's got around to doing yet.\n\nHeap believes there should be more transparency around what goes into a song, and how AI has been used.\n\nCiting the example of someone reading the label of a microwave ready meal so they know the ingredients, she says: \"We need that for music, and we need that for AI.\"\n\nThere is currently no legal obligation for streaming platforms to label AI-generated songs, despite increasing calls for them to signpost such tracks.\n\nIn January, the streaming platform Deezer launched an AI detection tool, followed this summer by a system which  tags AI-generated music .\n\nDeezer says its detection system can flag tracks made with the most prolific AI music creation tools, and is working on expanding its ability to detect music made by others. It says the risk of false positives - eg incorrectly flagging a track created by a human - is very low.\n\nThis week, the company said a third (34%) of content uploaded to its platform was fully AI-generated – about 50,000 tracks a day.\n\nManuel Moussallam, Deezer's director of research, says his team was so surprised by how many tracks were flagged up by the detector when it first launched they were \"pretty convinced we had an issue\".\n\nThe tool quickly flagged up the music by The Velvet Sundown – the band who went viral over the summer – as being \"100% AI-generated\".\n\nOther platforms have recently announced steps toward more transparency.\n\nIn September, Spotify said it would  roll out a new spam filter  later this year to identify \"bad actors\", and prevent \"slop\" being recommended to listeners. In the past year, it has removed more than 75 million spam tracks.\n\nIt is also supporting a way to enable artists to say where and how AI was used in a track, through a system by a consortium of industry members called DDEX. This information will be included in the metadata of a track and displayed on its app.\n\nSpotify says it is about recognising listeners' desire for more information, as well as \"strengthening trust\".\n\n\"It's not about punishing artists who use AI responsibly or down-ranking tracks for disclosing information about how they were made.\"\n\nIf you've fallen hard for a new artist, does it matter if they or their songs are made by AI?\n\nSome believe the presence of AI is irrelevant – engagement is driven by enjoyment, and music people love is already serving its primary purpose.\n\nOthers say music fans should be able to make informed choices about what they listen to.\n\nArtists have shared deep concerns around the impact of AI, and hundreds of musicians including  Dua Lipa and Sir Elton John have protested about the use of their songs in the training of AI tools .\n\nFor LJ Rich, the use of AI in music raises many \"weird and beautiful ethical questions\" which remain as yet unanswered.\n\n\"Like if the music makes the hairs on the back of your neck go up, does it matter if an AI wrote it or not?\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c246pv2n25zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"22:03:13.198+00:00","title":"Serbian president denies involvement in alleged Bosnia 'sniper tourism'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has publicly denied allegations that he participated in 'sniper tourism' during the 1990s siege of Sarajevo, claiming the accusations are fabricated disinformation.

For an Afternoon, They Were Just 2 Guys From Queens.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T20:05:28-05:00\n\nThere was one moment in particular when Zohran Mamdani seemed like he might have bit off a little more than he could chew by making his lonely pilgrimage down to the lion’s den that is President Trump’s blinged-out Oval Office.\n\nThe 34-year-old mayor-elect of New York was pressed by a reporter if he thought his host, who was sitting about four inches away, was really “a fascist.”\n\nHow terribly awkward.\n\nBut before Mr. Mamdani could even get out one of his slick and diplomatic answers, the president jumped in to throw him a lifeline.\n\n“That’s OK, you could just say, ‘Yes,’” Mr. Trump said, looking highly amused by the whole thing. He waved his hand, as if being called the worst term in the political dictionary was no big deal.\n\n“OK, all right,” Mr. Mamdani said with a smile.\n\n“It’s easier,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s easier than explaining it.” Chuckling good-naturedly, he reached up and gave Mr. Mamdani a pat on the arm. “I don’t mind,” he added.\n\nIt was like the oddest screwball buddy comedy in American politics. The “fascist” and the “communist.” The president and the mayor. The old man and the Young Turk.\n\nWere these really the same two guys who had spent the last many months flicking acid darts at one another?\n\nMr. Trump had falsely claimed that Mr. Mamdani, a naturalized U.S. citizen, might be here illegally, and had threatened to have him arrested. He had demonized him as a “communist” who would drive his beloved hometown into the gutter.\n\nMr. Mamdani didn’t shy from a scrap. In a memorable zinger from his victory speech earlier this month, he shot back, “So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n\nBut if there is one thing Mr. Trump respects, it’s a winner. He made it clear Friday that he was impressed Mr. Mamdani had triumphed as an underdog against the political establishment. “He came out of nowhere,” the president said. “What’d you start off at, one or two? I watched, I said, ‘Who is this guy?’”\n\nMr. Trump also appreciates a good media spectacle, and he was keenly aware that he had one on his hands. “The press has eaten this thing up,” he marveled to the phalanx of cameras crowded into the Oval Office. “I’ve had a lot of meetings with the heads of major countries, nobody cared. This meeting — you people have gone crazy.”\n\nMr. Mamdani, for his part, was clever about deploying certain facts that would help disarm his host. He made a point of talking about how Mr. Trump had gained votes in New York in the last presidential election, and described talking to Trump voters on Hillside Avenue in Queens and Fordham Road in the Bronx.\n\n“When we spoke to those voters who voted for President Trump, we heard them speak about cost of living,” Mr. Mamdani said. “We focus on that same cost of living.”\n\n“He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him,” Mr. Trump chuckled, “and I’m OK with that.”\n\nThe two did a kind of populist pas de deux that would have been unthinkable in a previous political age.\n\nFor once, there was no talk of crypto, billionaires or a gilded ballroom. It was as though Mr. Mamdani was bringing out in Mr. Trump his original focus on economic issues, one that powered his political rise but which some influential figures in the MAGA movement have lately been accusing Mr. Trump of abandoning.\n\nThings took a turn for the surreal when Mr. Trump stepped in to defend Mr. Mamdani from hard-edge questions being flung at him by the conservative media in the room.\n\nOne such type grilled Mr. Mamdani about why he had flown on a plane to Washington instead of taking a train, noting the latter would have been “greener.”\n\n“If he flew, that’s a lot quicker,” Mr. Trump said. He then turned to his guest, adding, “I’ll stick up for you.”\n\nThe president is in the midst of one of the trickiest periods of his second term, with some members of his own party beginning to break away on certain issues and his poll numbers dipping. He lashed out at reporters this week, even calling one “piggy,” and made dark threats against Democratic lawmakers, accusing them of treason, which he said was “punishable by death.”\n\nHis meeting with Mr. Mamdani was the happiest he had seemed in a while. There are few things that perk him up like talking about the five boroughs, and at times the pair just seemed like two guys from Queens, yukking it up over a couple of steaks at Keens.\n\nThey talked a lot about the city, commiserating over high Con Edison prices (a reference to the local utility that may have escaped many viewers). When Mr. Mamdani was asked about policing, Mr. Trump jumped in to praise him for retaining the commissioner of the N.Y.P.D., Jessica Tisch. He explained that his daughter Ivanka considered Ms. Tisch a “good friend.”\n\nMr. Trump said he was surprised to learn that Mr. Mamdani wanted more buildings to be developed in New York. “If I read the newspapers and the stories, I don’t hear that,” he said. (The day after Mr. Mamdani won, the cover of Mr. Trump’s favorite newspaper, The New York Post, featured an illustration of the mayor-elect dressed in red and holding a hammer and sickle aloft.)\n\nWho knows how long the warmth between them will last? Mr. Mamdani managed to make it out of the Oval Office without any visible battle scars, which is more than can be said for some other Democrats who have tried it.\n\nThe president said that he was hopeful for his hometown and its new mayor. “I feel very confident that he can do a very good job,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nAnd what a job it is.\n\n“By the way, being the mayor of New York City is a big deal,” the president of the United States said. “I always said, you know, one of the things I would have loved to be some day is the mayor of New York City.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/supreme-court-texas-congressional-map.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:16:16-05:00","title":"Texas Asks Supreme Court to Clear Way for Republican-Friendly Congressional Map","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Texas Office of the Attorney General has requested the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in a dispute over a newly redrawn congressional map, which Republicans and President Trump designed to favor Republican candidates in the 2026 midterms.

In the court’s ruling, Judge Jeffrey V. Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, a Trump appointee, wrote that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”\n\nIn the 160-page ruling, the judges blocked the use of the new map while litigation continues over its legality. In the meantime, they ordered the state to use a map enacted by the Texas Legislature in 2021 for the November 2026 elections.\n\nTexas’ Republican-controlled State Legislature redrew its map this summer, creating five new Republican-favored seats as part of a strategy by Mr. Trump to block Democrats from taking control of the House of Representatives.\n\nAfter the appeals court ruling, Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced that the state would appeal to the Supreme Court. In a statement, Mr. Paxton said he fully expected “the court to uphold Texas’ sovereign right to engage in partisan redistricting.”\n\nThe Texas legal loss was the latest challenge for the president’s effort to redraw state congressional maps to favor Republicans in the lead-up to the midterms. Last week, Indiana Republicans rejected the president’s request that they redraw congressional districts.\n\nThe fight over the Texas map is also the latest in a string of voting and elections-related challenges facing the justices. In October, they heard a challenge to Louisiana’s congressional voting map. In that case, a group of white voters argued that the state’s new map, redrawn after the latest census to include a second majority-Black district, was an illegal racial gerrymander that violated the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.\n\nA decision in the case is expected by the end of June or early July, and it could shape how the court views the Texas challenge. In Texas, challengers have argued that even as lawmakers sought to create new districts to achieve a partisan advantage, they in fact gerrymandered based on race.\n\nThe nationwide push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the midterms is highly unusual, breaking from decades of settled norms around the process for carving up legislative districts. The drive by the president has set off a race in states throughout the country. This month, California voters approved an aggressive plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts, potentially flipping five Republican seats, a major victory for Democrats. That map has also been challenged in court.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce91zvnrz0lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:37:57.980+00:00","title":"Outcry at France army chief's warning that country must prepare to 'lose children' in war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France's new army chief, General Fabien Mandon, has ignited a political firestorm by warning that the country must prepare to 'lose its children' in a potential war with Russia, stressing that France's real weakness lies in a lack of national spirit and willingness to suffer.

warning from France's new army chief about the country \"losing its children\" in a potential war with Russia has sharply divided political opinion.\n\nGen Fabien Mandon, who took over as army chief-of-staff in September, told a congress of mayors on Tuesday that France's biggest weakness in today's dangerous times was the lack of a will to fight.\n\n\"We have the know-how, and we have the economic and demographic strength to dissuade the regime in Moscow,\" he said.\n\n\"What we are lacking - and this is where you [the mayors] have a role to play - is the spirit. The spirit which accepts that we will have to suffer if we are to protect what we are.\n\n\"If our country wavers because it is not ready to lose its children … or to suffer economically because the priority has to be military production, then we are indeed at risk.\n\n\"You must speak of this in your towns and villages.\"\n\nThe remarks were in line with other pronouncements the general has made, warning of a coming confrontation with Russia and stressing the need for psychological as well as economic and military preparation.\n\nBut they were condemned as warmongering and out-of-place by political leaders on the left as well as the nationalist right.\n\nJean-Luc Mélenchon, who heads the far-left France Unbowed party, said he \"totally disagreed\" with the chief-of-staff.\n\n\"It's not his job to invite mayors or anyone else to start making military preparations that no-one has agreed on,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of the Communist Party Fabien Roussel said: \"No! 51,000 memorials to the war-dead in our towns and villages - aren't they enough? Yes to national defence, no to intolerably belligerent speeches.\"\n\nPractically alone on the left, Raphael Glucksmann - the strongly pro-Ukraine MEP and head of the Place Publique [Public Square] party - came out in support of General Mandon.\n\n\"By the strength of their reactions, these ostriches merely underline the state of denial and capitulation that is so strong in the French political class,\" he said.\n\n\"Gen Mandon is right to alert the nation about the need to change its state of mind.\"\n\nFor the far-right National Rally, Sébastien Chenu said the general had committed an \"error\" because he did not have the \"legitimacy\" to pronounce on such matters.  But another senior figure Louis Aliot said it was \"necessary to be ready to die for one's country … if the war is just or to ensure the survival of the nation\".\n\nIn an interview with a defence magazine earlier this month, Mandon said that \"by living for so long in peacetime, we find it hard to fully comprehend the dangers which now surround us and the intransigence of certain players.\n\n\"The Russians for their part do not know peace. They have been at war in Ukraine for years and they are ready to pursue it.\"\n\nIn October, he told the National Assembly's defence committee that \"the first objective I have given the armed forces is to be ready for a confrontation in three or four years, which may come in the form of a test.\n\n\"Russia is a country which could be tempted to pursue war on our continent and that is the determining factor as I make my plans,\" he said.\n\nDefence Minister Catherine Vautrin and government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon both came to the defence of the general.\n\n\"Our policy is to do everything to avoid war but at the same time prepare, and consolidate that collective moral force without which no nation can survive the test,\" said Vautrin.\n\nOther senior European defence figures have also warned of the need to prepare for a possible clash with Russia - particularly if it disengages from Ukraine following any peace deal.\n\nGerman defence minister Boris Pistorius told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the general view had been that a Russian act of aggression could come from the year 2029.\n\n\"But now some are saying that it could be envisaged from 2028 - and there are even experts who think we might have just lived through our last peacetime summer.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/nyregion/mamdani-trump-reaction-meeting.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:22:37-05:00","title":"The Trump-Mamdani Buddy Movie?

It’s Getting Mixed Reviews.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T20:22:37-05:00\n\nThere were smiles and more than a few laughs. Compliments, ranging from genuine to diplomatic, were abundant.\n\nAnd when reporters tried to interrupt the unexpected buddy movie that emerged in the White House on Friday, President Trump warmly placed his hand on Zohran Mamdani’s arm and gently advised him to keep it simple in response to a question about whether Mr. Mamdani considered him a fascist.\n\n“You can just say yes,” the president said. “It’s easier.”\n\nIt was an astonishingly affectionate performance that sent heads spinning, as New Yorkers confronted the once-unthinkable possibility that Mr. Mamdani, the democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City, and the president actually got along.\n\n“I mean, it did seem like a little bit of a bromance,” said Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican congresswoman from the conservative stronghold of Staten Island. “Based on the election results, we knew Mamdani was charming, but who thought he’d be able to charm the president?”\n\nFor weeks, New York leaders have been bracing for the likelihood of a devastating confrontation between the Trump administration and a City Hall led by Mr. Mamdani. They have gamed out what, precisely, it might look like if Mr. Trump sends federal troops or a surge of immigration enforcement agents into New York City. They have fretted about more funding cuts. They have formed rapid-response groups and enlisted the help of business leaders.\n\nThey have had reason to worry. Not only has Mr. Trump threatened New York City, but he also personally tried to prevent Mr. Mamdani from winning the mayoral election, even going so far as to urge Republicans to abandon their party nominee in favor of Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic former governor.\n\nBut then the cameras went live on Friday from the Oval Office. There was Mr. Mamdani, standing with a quiet smile by Mr. Trump’s side as the president lavished him with praise; commended his decision to keep the current police commissioner; applauded his pro-housing, pro-affordability inclinations; and helped him swat away unfriendly questions from the conservative press.\n\nTo hear Mr. Trump tell it, the two men, who occupy starkly opposing positions on Israel and Gaza, even found common ground there.\n\nCasting himself as the consummate peacemaker, Mr. Trump said Mr. Mamdani, too, “feels very strongly” about “peace in the Middle East.”\n\nSid Rosenberg, a conservative talk radio host who has interviewed Mr. Trump and whose suggestion that Mr. Mamdani would welcome another Sept. 11 attack became its own story line in the mayor’s race, said he was shocked at the president’s reaction. He posted a video response prefaced by an expletive-colored introduction conveying his disbelief. (He later deleted the video.)\n\n“I love Trump and I’m almost never critical of President Trump ever,” Mr. Rosenberg said in an interview. “He meets with people, from the Putins to Kim Jong-un, horrible people, horrible people that want to kill us, he meets with them. That’s how he fixes stuff. I get it.”\n\nBut, he said, referring to Mr. Mamdani: “For me as a Jew in New York, this guy really rubs me wrong. And to watch them shake hands and smile” made him want to lose his lunch.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s ability to win over skeptics and enemies has figured prominently in his political rise, as he has used his retail political skills to charm both taxi drivers and real estate magnates. On Friday, he appeared to have done it again.\n\nAna María Archila, the co-director of New York’s Working Families Party, giggled as she watched Mr. Trump’s “relaxed and happy energy with someone he has threatened to deport.” (In July, Mr. Trump threatened to arrest Mr. Mamdani, adding, “a lot of people are saying he’s here illegally.” Mr. Mamdani was born in Uganda but is a naturalized citizen.)\n\nMs. Archila also admitted to feeling “a tiny bit of relief” that perhaps some of Mr. Trump’s threats against New York may not come to pass, even though the president avoided discussing specifics.\n\n“There is the possibility that maybe this means New York City is not going to get invaded by federal troops on Jan. 1,” she said.\n\nIn this time of profound national division, the meeting also managed to please Joe Borelli, a pro-Trump Republican and a former councilman from Staten Island.\n\n“As a New Yorker, I was proud of both the mayor-elect and the president,” he said. “I think it’s a good lesson for people that the characters you make them out to be aren’t necessarily who they really are.”\n\nThe event seemed all the more remarkable because Mr. Mamdani — considered by some national Democratic leaders to be too far left to embrace — seemed to gain more ground with the president in one hour than his party has in Mr. Trump’s five years in office.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader from Brooklyn who never endorsed Mr. Mamdani’s campaign, was succinct in his praise.\n\n“Schumer feels a meeting like this can only be good for New York,” his spokesman said.\n\nOther reactions were more colorful.\n\n“I think JD Vance is jealous,” joked Brian Kilmeade, the Fox News host. “They really get along fantastic.”\n\nRoss Barkan, a political reporter who employed Mr. Mamdani as his campaign manager when he ran for the State Senate, wryly observed on social media that “Trump endorsed Mamdani before Schumer did.”\n\nEven as many New Yorkers rejoiced in the possibility of a functional relationship between City Hall and the White House, they also questioned how long it might take for Mr. Trump, known for his mercurial nature, to turn on Mr. Mamdani.\n\n“I don’t think Trump is a particularly consistent or morally guided actor so we need to prepare for potentially increased federal activity in the city,” said Grace Mausser, the co-chair for the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, the organization that has been central to Mr. Mamdani’s political success.\n\n“But overall, Zohran has always been a clear communicator and an effective political actor, and if this leads Trump to not attack the city, I think that’s good,” she added.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz32pz81vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-22","timeOfPublication":"01:58:29.151+00:00","title":"Radiohead deliver a spell-binding, hit-packed set in London","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Radiohead deliver a spell-binding, hit-packed set at London's O2 Arena after a 10-year gap in new music and 99 months without a UK performance.

But it's also an acknowledgment of how long fans have been waiting for this show.\n\nIt is now 10 years since Radiohead last released new material, and 99 months since their last UK gig.\n\nAnticipation for their return has been building ever since they announced a limited run of concerts in September. Setlists from early shows in Spain and Italy have generated news stories (\"Radiohead play Nice Dream for the first time since 2009\"), as fans pore over the song choices.\n\nAccording to one source, they've rehearsed 65 different numbers.\n\nAt the O2, the band sift through their entire discography - from the arena rock anthems of 1994's The Bends to the celestial ballads of A Moon Shaped Pool, via the layered electronics of Kid A, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary.\n\nThere are some signs that Radiohead are a bit rusty. A few timing and tuning issues crop up, which could easily be the result of a first night in a new venue, but which feel odd for a band of such technical proficiency.\n\nBut when it comes together, it's a rapturous, spell-binding sight.\n\nThey begin with the spacey, hypnotic Planet Telex, and follow it up with a crunchy version of  2+2=5, written in 2003 as a reaction to George W Bush's \"War on Terror\", and taking on new urgency in a world where political norms have seemingly been turned upside down.\n\nBy the third song, Sit Down, Stand Up, they're flexing their musical muscles, with an extended outro of percussive lunacy, aided by US session musician Chris Vatalaro.\n\nHis addition to the line-up is a giveaway. Radiohead's secret sauce has always been their rhythm section - who manage to locate sinewy, danceable grooves even when presented with their bandmate's most challenging material.\n\nThe prowling bassline of National Anthem and the slamming drum loops of Idioteque, in particular, give the audience ample opportunity to jump up and down.\n\nThat said, it's amusing to watch bassist Colin Greenwood try (and fail) to get the crowd clapping in time to the glitchy and unconventional rhythms of 15 Step.\n\nInstead, most of them simply bob their heads up and down in unified appreciation of the music. At times, it looks like a convention of nodding dogs.\n\nCushioned between the more experimental songs, however, were the real crowd-pleasers: An elegiac version of Lucky, a beautifully twisted No Surprises and a genuinely sublime version of Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.\n\nI have a theory, however, that the band's notorious dislike of \"the old stuff\" is an elaborate ruse. They've never really stopped playing songs from The Bends and OK Computer - but the suggestion they  won't  makes it all the more exciting when they break into something anthemic like Fake Plastic Trees.\n\nThat song opened Friday night's encore, which dwelt largely on their 90s material, including Let Down - a deep cut that's had a new lease of life on TikTok - and the epic Paranoid Android.\n\nIntroducing a muscular version of Just, Yorke explains that it was written \"on a freezing cold farm in 1994\", in a period where they thought they'd only be remembered for one song: Their 1992 breakout Creep.\n\nWe all know the story ended differently, but the reunion does find Radiohead in a strange position.\n\nThis tour comes with no new material, and the last seven years have been so fertile with side projects, most notably Thom Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood's three albums as The Smile, that it seemed Radiohead's members might have permanently moved on.\n\nSeveral factors got in the way - grief, parenthood, mental health and rumours of intra-band tension over Israel.\n\nAs recently as August,  Yorke said  a reunion was \"not on the cards from where I'm sitting\".\n\nAll of which makes the decision to play in the round, packed like sardines in a crushed tin can, all the more significant.\n\nThe group are symbolically returning to the rehearsal room, playing off each other as much as they are playing to the audience.\n\nYorke glides across the stage, doing that dance he does, moving from acoustic guitar to electric piano and back again.\n\nDuring Idioteque, guitarist Ed O'Brien catches him mid-transit, and they holler the lyrics directly to one another. At the start of Jigsaw Falling Into Place, Yorke and Greenwood face each other and play duelling guitars.\n\nIt suggests the tour has been an act of healing, even if the band have been assigned separate dressing rooms for the first time in their career.\n\nWhether that leads to anything more is still up for debate. \"We haven't thought past the tour,\"  Yorke recently told the Times . \"I'm just stunned we got this far.\"\n\nThe delighted fans who queued for the Tube home singing Karma Police will be hoping everything is in its right place for a fully-fledged comeback.\n\nPlanet Telex\n\n2 + 2 = 5\n\nSit Down, Stand Up\n\nLucky\n\nBloom\n\n15 Step\n\nThe Gloaming\n\nKid A\n\nNo Surprises\n\nVideotape\n\nWeird Fishes/Arpeggi\n\nIdioteque\n\nEverything in Its Right Place\n\nThe National Anthem\n\nDaydreaming\n\nJigsaw Falling Into Place\n\nBodysnatchers\n\nThere There\n\nEncore :\n\nFake Plastic Trees\n\nLet Down\n\nParanoid Android\n\nYou and Whose Army?\n\nA Wolf at the Door\n\nJust\n\nKarma Police"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/europe/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-capitulation.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:23:28-05:00","title":"To Many Ukrainians, U.S. Peace Plan Looks Like ‘Capitulation’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Many Ukrainians are rejecting a U.S.-backed peace plan proposed by the Trump administration, which requires Ukraine to surrender territory, reduce its military, abandon NATO ambitions, and accept a blanket amnesty for wartime crimes.

west, many Ukrainians on Friday used one word to dismiss a U.S.-Russian peace plan floated by the Trump administration: capitulation.\n\nThe 28-point plan would require Kyiv to surrender significant territory, reduce the size of its military and relinquish some weapons, according to officials familiar with the proposal. While the White House has cautioned that the proposal is still in “flux,” its contours reflect maximalist demands made by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia throughout the war that Ukraine has consistently rejected.\n\nThat helps explain the widespread Ukrainian response, summed up neatly by a banner headline on the homepage of the Kyiv Independent newspaper. It read “New U.S. peace plan pushes Ukraine toward capitulation” — a galling prospect despite widespread exhaustion and heavy losses from nearly four years of bitter fighting against the Russian invasion.\n\nIn western Ukraine, the city of Ternopil was reeling from a Russian missile strike on Wednesday that killed at least 31 people. Many there were deeply skeptical — and in some cases angry — about the proposal and who stood to gain from it.\n\nIryna Urezchenko, 66, has a close friend and colleague who is still missing more than two days after the strike. Rescuers were still searching under gray, wet skies for up to 10 bodies believed to be buried under rubble of a badly damaged apartment building.\n\n“It is horrific,” she said. “This peace plan means that we are fighting for nothing, giving our lives for nothing.”\n\nViacheslav Nehoda, the head of Ternopil’s regional military administration, stood near the still-smoking wreckage and held up his phone to display photos of some of the victims, asking, “Is this the kind of plan that’s needed?”\n\n“I have no words, because this is a proposal to capitulate to an enemy that is destroying civilians, that is killing people,” he said.\n\nWhile Ukrainians are significantly more open to a negotiated settlement than they were at the  war’s start, this proposal grated. That it was drafted without input from Kyiv or its European allies was particularly unpalatable to some Ukrainians, who echoed European leaders in saying a settlement without having a seat at the negotiating table was a nonstarter.\n\nViktor Alekseev, a reserve officer in Kyiv, said he was “alarmed” by parts of the proposal — namely its reference to a blanket amnesty for any crimes committed during the war. The draft also spells out a reduction of Western aid and the abandonment of Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO, longstanding Russian demands that he called “the next step toward the same war” with an enemy that rarely follows the rules.\n\n“I don’t even want to think about returning territories,” said Avi, a drone pilot in Ukraine’s military who asked to be identified by his military call sign. And Russia? “They don’t adhere to agreements,” he added.\n\nUkraine has bitter experience of security assurances collapsing when put to the test. As a draft of the proposal circulated online, Ukrainians invoked the Budapest Memorandum — a pledge signed in 1994 that was meant to protect the country after it gained independence.\n\nUnder that accord, Ukraine turned its former Soviet nuclear weapons over to Russia , in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the United States and Britain. But those guarantees clearly failed — evidenced by Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, first in 2014 and later with the full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\n“Sadly, I know history all too well. I remember the Budapest Memorandum,” said Leonid Komsky, 61, on Friday afternoon in Kyiv, the capital. While “everyone is exhausted — both here and at the front,” he said, Ukrainians have no choice but to keep fighting.\n\n“For Ukraine, this is a question of ‘to be or not to be.’ It is better to die standing than to die later as a slave,” he added.\n\nCapt. Oleh Voitsekhovsky, who is fighting near the eastern city of Lyman, said he did not think Washington should go from acting as the world’s policeman to being a “global broker — one that demands compensation for security guarantees and turns international relations into pure transactionism.”\n\n“Neither Ukraine, nor Russia, nor the U.S. will ultimately be satisfied with this plan,” he said in a message.\n\nThe Kremlin has deflected questions about whether it supports the proposal, which was presented to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Thursday by a visiting U.S. military delegation.\n\nThe plan is the latest in a string of Trump-led efforts to restart stalled negotiations, a point noted by Olena Hrosovska, 52, an art curator in Kyiv.\n\n“These proposals are nothing new; they keep popping up. The goal remains the same: to weaken Ukraine and fulfill Putin’s wish list,” she said Friday.\n\nBut Ms. Hrosovska acknowledged that Ukraine is vulnerable at the moment, grappling with a government corruption scandal, losses on the battlefield and persistent Russian airstrikes that have battered the country’s energy grid as winter descends.\n\n“That is why the people trying to push this through think they can finally force our hand,” she explained. “I hope they are wrong.”\n\nMaria Varenikova, Oleksandr Chubko and Cassandra Vinograd reported from Kyiv, Ukraine; and Oleksandra Mykolyshyn and Kim Barker from Ternopil, Ukraine.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccines-autism-website.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:50:29-05:00","title":"Kennedy Says He Told C.D.C. to Change Website’s Language on Autism and Vaccines","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Health Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. said in an interview that he personally instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to abandon its longstanding position that vaccines do not cause autism — a move that underscores his determination to challenge scientific orthodoxy and bend the health department to his will.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday explaining why the C.D.C. website now says the claim that vaccines do not cause autism is not “evidence-based,” Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that large-scale epidemiological studies of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had found no link to autism, and that studies of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal had also shown no link.\n\nBut he cited gaps in vaccine safety science. He said he ordered the C.D.C. to change its guidance in part because high-quality large studies had not been conducted to examine a potential link between autism and other shots given in the first year of life. Those include the hepatitis B vaccine and a combination shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough.\n\nIn his view, sweeping statements like “vaccines don’t cause autism” are unproven, and have been deployed by public health leaders who want to ease parents’ fears. He said he is not saying vaccines cause autism; he is simply saying there is no proof that they don’t.\n\n“The whole thing about ‘vaccines have been tested and there’s been this determination made,’ is just a lie,” Mr. Kennedy said in the interview, his first with a major print publication. He added, “The phrase ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ is not supported by science.”\n\nIt is highly unusual for a health secretary to personally order a change to scientific guidance. Former C.D.C. officials say that such changes are usually initiated by agency scientists, and in some cases might go to the secretary’s office for review. Mr. Kennedy’s intervention flows out of his two decades of vaccine activism, and demonstrates his intense interest in the topic even as other health issues, including the cancellation of insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, are swirling in Washington.\n\nExperts say Mr. Kennedy is correct, in a narrow sense, in saying that certain studies have not yet been done. But they say he is also asking for a level of proof that is difficult to achieve. As Dr. Arthur Caplan, who directs the medical ethics division at New York University, once wryly noted, “You can’t prove that Coca-Cola doesn’t cause autism either.”\n\nMost mainstream public health leaders, including an official at the American Medical Association, a former C.D.C. director and the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, say the question of whether vaccines cause autism has been settled. Mr. Kennedy’s critics say he is cherry-picking facts and seeking studies to confirm his own predetermined conclusion.\n\nBy focusing on a theoretical, unproven risk, critics say, Mr. Kennedy is using his platform as health secretary to discourage vaccination, an issue that earned him millions of dollars and boosted his political career. They accuse him of playing on parents’ fears about autism, while ignoring incontrovertible evidence that vaccines have saved millions of lives.\n\n“There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism but do save lives,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, who led the C.D.C. during the Biden administration. She said the website change damages the C.D.C.’s credibility and “risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.”\n\nThe website changes have once again put the secretary at odds with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and the health committee chairman, who is also a doctor. To win the senator’s vote for confirmation, Mr. Kennedy promised not to remove a statement from the C.D.C. website stating that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nThe statement remains at the top of the site, with an asterisk leading to a footnote that says the header “has not been removed due to an agreement “ with the health committee chairman.\n\nThe page goes on to say that the claim is not “evidence-based” and that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.” It does not mention the live-saving benefits of vaccines.\n\nMr. Cassidy, writing Thursday on the social media platform X, appeared incensed.\n\n“I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,” he wrote. “What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n\nMr. Kennedy said in the interview that he had spoken with the senator about the website changes.\n\n“I did talk to him,” Mr. Kennedy said of Mr. Cassidy. “He disagreed with the decision.” Mr. Cassidy has recently said he would like Mr. Kennedy to appear before his committee; the secretary said he would be “happy to.”\n\nThe introduction of routine childhood immunization is widely considered one of the greatest success stories of public health.\n\nA study published last year in the medical journal The Lancet estimated that since 1974, when the World Health Organization launched its global vaccination program, vaccines had averted 154 million deaths worldwide, including those of 146 million children younger than 5. The C.D.C. has cited vaccines as one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.\n\nBefore the pertussis vaccine became widely available in the 1940s, for example, as many as 200,000 people got sick with whooping cough every year in the United States, and about 9,000 died, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963, about 450 Americans died each year from the disease.\n\nDr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, a trustee of the American Medical Association, said the organization was “deeply concerned that perpetuating misleading claims on vaccines will lead to further confusion, distrust and ultimately, dangerous consequences for individuals and public health.”\n\nConcerns about vaccine safety, which have percolated since the 1980s, intensified in 1998, after a British doctor, Andrew Wakefield, published a small study asserting that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine might be linked to autism. That paper has since been retracted, and numerous studies — including a 10-year study of 600,000 children published in 2019 — have found no association.\n\nA 2018 study that followed 82,000 pregnant women who were given the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine found their babies were not at increased risk for autism.\n\nHowever, Dr. Daniel Salmon, who directs the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Mr. Kennedy was correct about the absence of high-quality, large-scale epidemiological research on autism and infants given the vaccines for hepatitis B and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Dr. Salmon has long advocated greater federal investment in vaccine safety science.\n\n“I think that there are gaps in science that need to be filled,” Dr. Salmon said. “We need a research agenda and we need to make it a priority to answer these questions, but it’s got to be done with rigorous science, and the science is really hard to do.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a frequent critic of Mr. Kennedy, said that studies of the measles vaccine were prompted by the Wakefield paper. He said no reputable scientists had made similar claims that would warrant investigations into other vaccines.\n\n“So what’s his hypothesis?” Dr. Offit asked, referring to Mr. Kennedy. “What is it about the hepatitis B vaccine that he thinks causes autism?”\n\nEpidemiological studies, which look at large populations, show only associations and do not prove cause and effect. Mr. Kennedy argues that scientists must pay more attention to “vulnerable subgroups” of children who are not identified by such studies, and might be at risk for vaccine injuries. He also wants research into biological mechanisms or genetic factors that might make certain children vulnerable.\n\nBut the question of whether additional vaccine safety research is needed is separate from the question of whether children should be vaccinated, Dr. Salmon said.\n\nIn 1986, Congress passed a law, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, that offered vaccine makers liability protection from lawsuits and required the C.D.C. to conduct a review of pertussis and rubella vaccines. (The pertussis vaccine that was in use in 1986 is no longer administered in the United States.)\n\nMr. Kennedy said in the interview that he ordered the website changes in part because the C.D.C. had not complied with that requirement.\n\nDr. Cohen, the former C.D.C. director, said the research had been done, pointing to a 1994 study by the Institute of Medicine, She said the C.D.C. carefully weighs all known benefits and risks before making vaccine recommendations.\n\nBut Mr. Kennedy asserted that the agency had not met the law’s directive to “post representations of science with the best, highest quality data.”\n\nHe noted that comprehensive reviews of existing vaccine safety science, including by the Institute of Medicine, have called for additional research into broad questions of vaccine safety.\n\nThe Informed Consent Action Network, a nonprofit led by Del Bigtree, Mr. Kennedy’s former communications director, lauded the website changes as vindication for parents who claim vaccines are a cause of their child’s autism. The group had sued the C.D.C. in 2020 demanding that the “vaccines do not cause autism” statement be removed.\n\nJessica Steier, a public health scientist who specializes in science communications, argues that in calling for additional research, Mr. Kennedy is following a well-worn playbook of his movement.\n\n“Vaccine critics like Mr. Kennedy often give the impression that scientists haven’t seriously researched whether vaccines might cause autism,” Dr. Steier wrote in an August opinion piece in The New York Times. Her own review found “more than 40 high-quality studies since 1998 involving over 5.6 million people across seven countries,” she wrote. “All found no connection between vaccines and autism.”\n\nDr. Offit likened the secretary’s call for more studies to a never-ending “game of Whac-a-Mole” in which each time a question is answered, Mr. Kennedy and his allies raise new ones.\n\n“They just keep moving the goal posts,” Dr. Offit said. The changes to the C.D.C. website, he said, are “unnecessarily scaring parents at a time when vaccine rates are already eroding.”\n\nMr. Kennedy suggested it is not his job to frame messages with an eye toward tamping down parents’ fears.\n\n“I think the way to drive up vaccine utilization, ultimately, is to be honest with people,” he said, adding, “My job is not to gaslight Americans but to give them accurate information about the state of the science.”\n\nApoorva Mandavilli and Christina Jewett contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/europe/ukraine-russia-us-peace-plan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:24:09-05:00","title":"The U.S. Tightens the Vise on an Already Besieged Zelensky","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is facing an escalating diplomatic crisis as the United States presents a 28-point peace proposal that favors Russia by demanding territorial concessions, a capped army size, recognition of Russian control over eastern regions, and constitutional changes to bar NATO membership.

2025-11-21T15:24:09-05:00\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, already in a crucible of pressure from a corruption scandal and battlefield setbacks, is now facing one of the deepest quandaries of his presidency in a new peace plan from the United States.\n\nThe 28-point proposal favors Russia in pivotal aspects, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory and cap the size of its postwar army, while offering financial and geopolitical incentives to Moscow. Ukraine has rejected many of the conditions before, but Kyiv’s room for maneuver is shrinking as the Trump administration pushes for a response by next week.\n\nMr. Zelensky referred to the tightening vise in a speech to the nation on Friday. He cast the American proposal as a dilemma between losing the United States as an ally and acquiescing to Russian demands. He seemed to suggest that the United States had threatened to withhold what assistance it still provided, which was mostly limited to intelligence sharing.\n\n“Now is one of the most difficult moments in our history,” Mr. Zelensky said. “Now Ukraine may face a very difficult choice: either loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.”\n\nUkraine would have to accept concessions, he said, or face “an extremely difficult winter, the most difficult, and further risks.”\n\nMr. Zelensky said of the United States, “They will expect an answer from us.” He said that he would adhere to Ukraine’s constitution and would “offer alternatives,” and that Ukraine should not be cast as shunning diplomacy to end the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader responded to the increasing pressure by turning, as he has before, to European allies. He held a conference call with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain. In a statement, Mr. Zelensky said that Ukraine would coordinate its next moves with the European leaders.\n\nHow effectively Mr. Zelensky can negotiate with the Trump administration will largely depend on how much continued European support he can muster.\n\nHis outreach repeats a playbook that kept him in the game with the Trump administration’s negotiating tactics at earlier moments of tension. When called on, Ukraine’s allies in Europe, alarmed by the potential security threats to their countries of a Russian victory in the war, have provided backup.\n\nEuropean leaders embraced Mr. Zelensky after President Trump lit into him at an Oval Office meeting in February. They negotiated to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine after the Trump administration closed the spigot of military aid. And European leaders flew to Washington to support Mr. Zelensky after a summit in August between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, another moment that raised fears that the Trump administration and the Kremlin were moving to impose unfavorable terms on Kyiv.\n\nThe 28-point document now being pushed by the White House was negotiated between Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s envoy for peace missions, and a Russian official, Kirill Dmitriev. In a radio interview on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he wanted a response from Mr. Zelensky by Thursday, but that the deadline could be extended “if things are working well.”\n\nUkraine and Europe have said they had no input in the proposal, and European foreign ministers voiced outrage over the plan, saying it would weaken Ukraine’s long-term security.\n\nAccording to a draft posted online by a Ukrainian lawmaker, the proposal would require Ukraine to change its constitution to prohibit any effort to join NATO. It would force Kyiv to recognize Russian control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, parts of which Ukraine still holds. And it would cap the size of the Ukrainian Army at 600,000, down from an estimated current strength of more than 800,000.\n\nThe proposal would also bar the presence of NATO troops inside Ukraine, which would derail a European plan to help ensure the country’s postwar security.\n\nIf Ukraine agrees to end the war, the proposal says, it would be given frozen Russian assets to help pay for its reconstruction. Kyiv would also receive what the plan calls reliable security guarantees, promising a military response if Russia invaded again but offering few details.\n\nIf Moscow were to invade again, the proposal says, sanctions would be reinstated and Moscow would lose benefits included in the agreement. Those sweeteners include major Russian goals like readmittance to the Group of 8, reintegration into the global economy and joint investment opportunities with the United States.\n\nThe proposal comes as Mr. Zelensky’s government has been weakened by a sweeping corruption scandal implicating ministers and associates of the president. They are accused of taking millions of dollars in kickbacks from the state-owned nuclear energy company.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine is under growing pressure on the battlefield. Its army is short of soldiers, leaving gaps on the front line that Russia has exploited for small advances. And Kyiv is facing increasing financial strain, with a European plan to finance next year’s budget through loans linked to frozen Russian funds now in doubt.\n\nThere is rising support within Ukraine for a peace deal, after years in which Ukrainians mostly seethed at Russia’s invasion and opposed any concessions. Support for a negotiated settlement has grown from 10 percent in 2022, the first year of the war, to 74 percent today, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.\n\nIn Russia, the government has said little about the 28-point plan. But the Kremlin hardened its tone toward Ukraine on Friday, warning that Kyiv must enter into negotiations “now rather than later” or face losing more territory.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, said that Mr. Zelensky’s “room for maneuver regarding decision-making is shrinking as territories are lost during the offensive actions” of the Russian Army.\n\n“Continuing is senseless and dangerous for them,” Mr. Peskov added, referring to the Ukrainian leadership.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Putin took the opportunity to emphasize that Russia was making progress on the battlefield, donning fatigues at a command post. At a security council meeting in the Kremlin on Friday, Mr. Putin said that Russia was ready either to discuss the U.S.-backed plan or continue fighting.\n\nUkrainian commentators suggested that Russia was pressing the settlement proposal now to exploit Mr. Zelensky’s vulnerability from the corruption accusations and to delay any decision by Europe on the frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe talks that led to the 28-point plan are taking place outside traditional channels for both the Americans and the Russians. Diplomatic ties became strained last month when the United States canceled a proposed summit in Hungary between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, seeing little sign that Russia was willing to compromise.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Witkoff, the real estate developer turned top negotiator for Mr. Trump, worked on the 28 points with Mr. Dmitriev, a longtime Putin ally and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nMr. Dmitriev’s role in Ukraine talks had originally been limited to negotiating possible U.S.-Russian business and economic deals. Now Mr. Dmitriev appears to have veered into the center of peace negotiations.\n\nThe terms of the settlement proposal require many steps beyond Ukraine’s control.\n\nThe settlement envisions a halt to NATO expansion, ending a long policy of an open door at the alliance, as well as Russia’s acceptance into the G8, a club of wealthy democracies, from which it was expelled after annexing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe agreement would require $100 billion in frozen Russian assets to be spent on U.S.-led reconstruction in Ukraine, with half of the profits given to America. A separate fund would be reserved for U.S.-Russian joint ventures.\n\nUkraine would withdraw from territory it controls in the Donetsk region, including the fortress cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, and the area would become a demilitarized zone.\n\nThe proposal would also require amnesties for crimes committed during the war. Ukraine has opened thousands of war crimes investigations, including over well-documented mass killings and torture in occupied areas.\n\nAs Mr. Zelensky prepared to negotiate over the plan’s terms, it was unclear whether Russia was willing to do the same.\n\n“If it’s treated as a framework for a negotiation, on which the outcome of these issues is not predetermined, then it could move us in some direction,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist and Russia specialist at the RAND Corporation.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/style/vanity-fair-olivia-nuzzi.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:23:00-05:00","title":"Vanity Fair Is Reviewing Its Ties to Olivia Nuzzi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vanity Fair, under editor Mark Guiducci, has initiated a review of its ties to journalist Olivia Nuzzi, following a Substack essay by her former fiancé Ryan Lizza that alleges she had a personal relationship with Mark Sanford, a former political figure she profiled in 2019.

He decided to put only male actors on the cover of the magazine’s annual Hollywood issue, and he hired the scandal-plagued journalist Olivia Nuzzi as its West Coast editor.\n\nNow, after the publication of an essay that raised new questions about Ms. Nuzzi’s adherence to journalistic ethics, the magazine is reviewing her past conduct, according to a Vanity Fair spokeswoman.\n\nMs. Nuzzi, 32, lost a previous high-profile job — as the Washington correspondent at New York magazine — when her bosses learned in September 2024 that she had engaged in a close personal relationship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom she had profiled for the publication the year before.\n\nThe concern at Vanity Fair came about in the wake of a Substack essay written by Ms. Nuzzi’s former fiancé, the political journalist Ryan Lizza.\n\nHis lengthy piece, “Part I: How I Found Out,” set social media alight when it appeared on Monday. In it, Mr. Lizza claimed that Ms. Nuzzi had engaged in an affair with another powerful man she had written about for New York magazine: Mark Sanford, the former governor of South Carolina and a onetime Republican presidential candidate.\n\nMs. Nuzzi’s article on Mr. Sanford was published in September 2019, and she appeared to have started a relationship with him months after that, Mr. Lizza wrote.\n\nAsked if Ms. Nuzzi would continue in her new role at Vanity Fair in the wake of Mr. Lizza’s claims, a spokeswoman for the magazine said, “We were taken by surprise, and we are looking at all the facts.”\n\nMs. Nuzzi declined to comment on the matter.\n\nHours before Mr. Lizza posted his Substack essay, Vanity Fair’s website featured an excerpt from Ms. Nuzzi’s forthcoming book, “American Canto,” in which she describes her ardent feelings for a Kennedy-like character she calls the Politician.\n\nIn response to the allegations in Mr. Lizza’s post, Ms. Nuzzi’s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld, said in a statement, “In ‘American Canto,’ Ms. Nuzzi discusses the only instance in her long career as a journalist in which she had an improper relationship with someone she was covering.”\n\nHe added that his client would “not dignify efforts to impugn her character with any future response.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/professors-jeffrey-epstein-relationships.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"17:10:40-05:00","title":"The Professors Who Stayed Close With Epstein","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that after Jeffrey Epstein’s 2008 conviction and imprisonment, prominent academics from elite institutions such as Harvard and MIT maintained close financial and personal relationships with him, seeking research funding and advice.

2025-11-21T17:10:40-05:00\n\nIn the early days of the #MeToo movement in late 2017, Lawrence Krauss, a professor at Arizona State University at the time, received a list of pointed questions from reporters at BuzzFeed News preparing an article about sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\nLooking for advice on how to respond, he turned to a friend who had more than a little experience taking on troubling allegations. “I think you should include a short concise cover letter. that you would like published in it entirety,” wrote the friend — the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTheir email exchange is included in the 20,000 pages of documents acquired from Mr. Epstein’s estate, released last week by a House committee.\n\nMr. Epstein’s recommended defense for Mr. Krauss? “in general , these are false. they were either investigated and found lacking or ignored. etc,” Mr. Epstein wrote.\n\nMr. Krauss’s connection to the disgraced financier was previously known, as is the case for a number of the academics mentioned in the recent document dump. Among them was the Harvard University economist Lawrence H. Summers, who, emails show, discussed with Mr. Epstein his romantic pursuit of a woman. Mr. Summers, who previously served as Treasury secretary and Harvard’s president, has stepped back from teaching while the school reviews his links to Mr. Epstein.\n\nBut the newly released emails provide fresh insights into Mr. Epstein’s world of money and influence and how a coterie of prominent scientists, professors and researchers from elite institutions sought a piece of that world.\n\nThe emails show that even after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 and went to jail for solicitation of prostitution with a minor, prominent academics, including at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, eagerly engaged with him, seeking financial support, gossip and advice. Often, they sought to leverage his connections to raise money for their research, even after their own institutions had banned donations from Mr. Epstein.\n\nSome of the exchanges include language denigrating to women, shared between men who never foresaw their words becoming public. In the documents, Mr. Epstein’s communications with several academics were particularly notable, although there may be others. And there could be more revelations: President Trump signed this week a bill ordering the release of more documents concerning Mr. Epstein.\n\nHarvard is now reviewing links between Mr. Epstein and people at the university mentioned in the emails, the school has said. The professors mentioned include Elisa New, a professor of American literature, emerita; and Martin Nowak, professor of mathematics and of biology, who once led Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, to which Mr. Epstein had donated.\n\n“Just like other people collect art, he collects scientists,” Mr. Nowak said about Mr. Epstein nearly two decades ago, in a Palm Beach Post article about prosecutors trying to build a sex crime case against Mr. Epstein.\n\nMr. Epstein died by suicide in jail in August 2019, while facing charges related to the sex trafficking of minors.\n\nMr. Krauss said in a statement this week that he had never hidden his association with Mr. Epstein, and that he had “sought out advice from essentially everyone I knew” when he was accused of sexual misconduct. He has maintained that the accusations are false.\n\n“As should be noted, none of the communications with Epstein relate in any way to the horrendous crimes he was accused of in 2019,” Mr. Krauss said. “I was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested.”\n\nMr. Krauss, who announced his retirement from Arizona State in 2018, said that Mr. Epstein, who did not graduate from college, “was fascinated by science,” and they had attended scientific meetings and salons together.\n\nIn 2018, Mr. Epstein forwarded Mr. Krauss a list of attendees for the Women in the World Summit, a convention of female leaders and activists. Mr. Krauss responded, “Let’s do a men of the world conference,” and listed men accused of misconduct: Kevin Spacey, Bill Clinton, Al Franken and Woody Allen.\n\nThe evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers is also mentioned in the new tranche of emails. In 2015, he told Reuters that Mr. Epstein had given him about $40,000 for his research. And he defended Mr. Epstein, saying girls mature sooner than they used to. “By the time they’re 14 or 15, they’re like grown women were 60 years ago, so I don’t see these acts as so heinous,” he said to Reuters.\n\nIn December 2018, Mr. Trivers emailed Mr. Epstein about funding. “Apologies for requesting support in what was originally intended as an update on work done,” he wrote. “you once said you would ‘never not support me’ but never, as we both know, is a very long time – i am much more scared of Trump’s capacity to destroy the stock market – but as long as i do not get orders from you to sell, i will ride it out.\n\n“i hope everything is good in your life,” he wrote.\n\nMr. Trivers did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nMs. New, who is married to Mr. Summers, wrote to Mr. Epstein in 2015, the emails show, to thank him for a donation he had arranged. “Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project,” she wrote. “That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard’s role in producing the highest quality humanities content in the WORLD.”\n\nA 2020 Harvard review found that one of Mr. Epstein’s foundations claimed on tax forms in 2016 that it had donated $110,000 to a nonprofit organization of which Ms. New was president. Ms. New issued a statement this week apologizing for maintaining contact with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAfter Mr. Epstein got out of jail in 2009, he embarked on a campaign to rehabilitate his public image. That effort, as reported by The Times in 2019, included placing articles on news sites.\n\nIn those articles, Mr. Epstein cast himself as a patron of science. In 2017, the emails show, Mr. Epstein reached out to Mr. Nowak to introduce him to Mr. Epstein’s publicist, Masha Drokova, to arrange an interview between the two. Following the interview, Ms. Drokova emailed Mr. Epstein to say that she “had a great conversation with Martin” and that “he loves you.”\n\nMr. Epstein and Mr. Nowak had a long-running personal and financial relationship. In 2003, Mr. Epstein donated $6.5 million to establish Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Mr. Epstein apparently visited Harvard some 40 times after getting out of jail, a university review said.\n\nAfter publishing a report on its financial ties to Mr. Epstein in 2020, Harvard placed Mr. Nowak under sanctions for two years and shuttered his Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. He remains a professor of mathematics and of biology at Harvard.\n\nMr. Nowak did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nEmails between Mr. Epstein and Joichi Ito, a prominent academic who ran M.I.T.’s Media Lab, show how Mr. Epstein’s influence persisted almost to his death.\n\nMr. Ito had accepted funds from Mr. Epstein while serving as the director of the Media Lab, a center known for its boundary-pushing research. The revelation in 2019 of Mr. Ito’s personal and financial relationship with Mr. Epstein precipitated his leaving the university, as well as roles at the MacArthur Foundation, the Knight Foundation and the board of directors of The New York Times Company.\n\nUnder Mr. Ito, the Media Lab used money provided by Mr. Epstein to support the work of Joscha Bach, an A.I. researcher, according to a 2020 M.I.T. review.\n\nMr. Bach appeared in last week’s document dump, writing long and often technical emails to Mr. Epstein. In 2016, he wrote to Mr. Epstein that “black kids in the US have slower cognitive development,” and “You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts and mechanisms intrinsically boring.”\n\nNeither Mr. Ito nor Mr. Bach immediately responded to requests for comment Friday.\n\nMr. Epstein and Mr. Ito strategized over email in 2019 about how to fund work at M.I.T., including how to secure donations from others in Mr. Epstein’s orbit. In one exchange just months before Mr. Epstein’s death, the pair appeared to discuss how Mr. Epstein could secure additional funding for Mr. Ito’s work even after M.I.T. rejected a $25,000 donation from a foundation linked to Mr. Epstein.\n\n“We were able to keep the Leon Black money,” Mr. Ito wrote, referring to Mr. Epstein’s associate, a former private equity executive. But, he added, “the $25K from your foundation is getting bounced by MIT.”\n\nMr. Epstein replied that this was “no problem” and that he was “trying to get more black for you.”\n\nIn one 2017 exchange, Mr. Epstein remarked, “with all these guys getting busted for harassment, i have moved slightly up on the reputation ladder.”\n\nMr. Ito replied, “#metoo is quite amazing…”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/travel/sean-duffy-airlines-manners-video.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"15:11:04-05:00","title":"Sean Duffy Wants You to Stop Wearing PJs on the Plane","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy launched a public campaign titled 'The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You' to promote civility and respectful behavior among air travelers, citing a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts since 2019.

Check. Suitcase? Check. But what about your pillbox hat?\n\nAs travelers head to the airports this holiday season, the U.S. government wants them to rethink their travel checklists, their behavior — and also, their outfits.\n\nSean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, began a new campaign on Wednesday that he called “The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You,” complete with a 1960s-style public service announcement that spliced together scenes of the country’s first air travelers, dressed in suits and hats, with present-day clips of in-flight brawls and airport meltdowns. In the background, Frank Sinatra sings “Come Fly With Me.”\n\nBut the Transportation Department’s accompanying news release criticized more than fighting. It chastised fliers for forgetting to say “please” and “thank you” and for not helping older or pregnant passengers put their bags in the overhead bins.\n\n“Are you dressing with respect?” Mr. Duffy asks in the video. “Are you keeping control of your children?”\n\n“Bringing civility back, I think, enhances the travel experience for everybody,” Mr. Duffy said in a Fox News Business appearance, adding, “Let’s maybe go back to an era where we didn’t wear our pajamas to the airport.”\n\nThe announcement came on the heels of Mr. Duffy’s decision last week to scrap a proposal that would have required airlines to compensate passengers for significant travel disruptions within carriers’ control. The move was the Transportation Department’s latest attempt to roll back passenger protections and regulations geared toward making airlines accountable for improving customer service.\n\nThe news release cited data from the Federal Aviation Administration showing that “in-flight outbursts” increased 400 percent since 2019. These instances of air rage became common during the Covid-19 pandemic, when, after months of being locked down, many people returned to flying. The bad behavior coupled with the airlines’ moves to tighten margins and increase profits after a drop-off in demand created a perfect storm.\n\nVideos of passenger misbehavior have also proven to be popular online, where clips on social media of people with their shoes and socks off or passengers brawling in the aisles have gone viral. Mr. Duffy’s video included many of these clips, including one where a passenger scrolls through a flight’s entertainment options on a screen using their toes.\n\nMore recently, the travel experience has changed in other ways. A number of highly publicized plane crashes and near misses have brought attention to the lack of air traffic controllers. The recent government shutdown led Mr. Duffy to cancel flights across the country in order to limit the stress on overworked controllers — many of whom had picked up second jobs as they went without pay.\n\nThat issue receives a brief mention at the end of the Transportation Department’s news release, promising to build “an all-new air traffic control system” and increase hiring. In Mr. Duffy’s video, the main issue is a key word: “civility.”\n\n“Let’s bring civility and manners back,” Mr. Duffy says over Sinatra’s backing trumpets. “The golden age of travel begins with you.”\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

The interloper, known as Theia, was destroyed, and parts of it and Earth were sprayed into space. The result was the moon.\n\nIt’s a violent, elegant theory for how Earth got its moon. But many questions about this moon-making cataclysm remain. One important unanswered query: Where in the solar system did Theia come from?\n\nA study published Thursday in the journal Science may help answer this and other questions about this cosmic scuffle. By looking at chemical clues hidden in Earth’s rocks, meteorites and moon matter, scientists have found ghostly remnants of Theia. And they show that Theia and the early Earth were built from the same construction materials.\n\nThat explains why the chemistry of moon rocks is so similar to Earth’s: Theia’s impact on a chemically similar Earth would make a moon that resembled both orbs.\n\nThis also means that Earth and Theia took shape in the same part of space, in a swirl of dust and gas next to an adolescent sun, in what we now call the inner solar system.\n\nAlthough there are several hypotheses as to how Earth got its moon, Theia is the prime suspect. The proposed object explains much about the Earth-moon system, and the solar system’s planet-making era “resembles a vast cosmic billiard game,” said Nicolas Dauphas, a cosmochemist at the University of Hong Kong and an author of the new study.\n\nBack then, giant impacts were commonplace. Eventually, these dropped off — but they didn’t disappear entirely. “Earth happened to have been hit by a late one,” said Thorsten Kleine, a geochemist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany and an author of the new study.\n\nComputer impact simulations usually (but not always) forge a moon that is made mostly of Theia. That has been a sticking point because the moon, chemically, has much in common with Earth’s mantle, the putty-like layer below the crust on which we live.\n\nTrying to solve this puzzle is “really, really hard,” said Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved with the new study. Apart from two inaccessible giant blobs sitting on Earth’s core, which could be surviving fragments, Theia no longer exists — at least not in a way that can be directly studied. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying,” he said.\n\nFor the new study, scientists zeroed in on the iron content of Earth and moon rocks.\n\nWhen Earth was still forming, iron that was initially present trickled down into the core, where it remains today. But Earth’s mantle also has a substantial amount of iron. It doesn’t make sense that so much would have been left behind as Earth’s core formed, because the dense iron droplets should have made their way down toward it. That means a large fraction of Earth’s mantle iron must have come from an extraterrestrial source at a later date.\n\nTheia is a handy explanation for that mantle iron, which in turn can hint at the overall makeup of the kamikaze object.\n\nIron comes in different forms. If the iron mixtures of mantle-derived Earth rocks and lunar rocks were found to be comparable, that would suggest the Earth, Theia and the moon were made from the same foundational stuff. The team found them to be virtually indistinguishable.\n\nThe iron signatures of all three are also a close match to those found within meteorites known as non-carbonaceous chondrites. These space rocks formed close to the sun during the solar system’s early days. That suggests Earth and Theia first appeared in the same sun-kissed part of space.\n\nEarth is also oddly enriched in material created by a type of nuclear reaction inside stars. The young Earth formed in the vicinity of the sun, but it shouldn’t have quite this much solar spice. The researchers think this extra seasoning also came from Theia, meaning the object formed even closer to the sun than Earth did.\n\n“They’ve certainly done a lot of work, taking a smorgasbord of samples and trying to make sense of it all,” Dr. Byrne said. But this new history of the collision of Earth and Theia is still filled with questions that, owing to Theia’s self-vaporization, may never be resolved.\n\n“The past really is lost to us,” Dr. Byrne said — but at least we have an argent moon to admire in the present.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/abbott-texas-muslim-investigation.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:57:17-05:00","title":"Abbott’s Moves to Restrict Muslims Leave Some Concerned and Puzzled","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has taken a series of controversial actions targeting Muslim organizations, including declaring the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) a foreign terrorist organization and directing law enforcement to investigate the Islamic Tribunal in Dallas, which he claims is illegally enforcing Shariah law and operating as a rival court.

Greg Abbott of Texas has announced a flurry of steps this week aimed at thwarting Islamic groups in the state, moves that both worry and baffle Muslims and religious experts.\n\nOn Tuesday, he declared that the Council on American-Islamic Relations, one of the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy and civil rights groups, was a foreign terrorist organization, an accusation the group said had no basis in fact. The following day, he directed law enforcement officers to investigate an Islamic organization in Dallas, saying the group was illegally enforcing Islamic “Shariah law” in the state.\n\nIn a letter sent on Wednesday to district attorneys and sheriffs in two North Texas counties, Mr. Abbott suggested there were multiple entities in the state “masquerading” as legal courts, but he named only one: the Islamic Tribunal, an independent institution that has operated in the Dallas area for more than a decade.\n\nThe letter quoted from the tribunal’s website to suggest it was illegally posing as a rival court to the Texas judicial system and speculated that the court could recommend stoning as a punishment.\n\nOther faith groups operate ecclesiastical tribunals in the United States that resolve spiritual matters and disputes that overlap with the traditional court system. In Judaism, rabbinical courts known as beth dins rule on the details of divorce agreements, among other issues. Catholic dioceses, including the diocese of Dallas and others throughout Texas, also operate courts to handle cases of church law, including marriage and annulment.\n\nThe governor’s statement said the Islamic Tribunal was different from other faith-based arbitration bodies because it was “purporting to replace actual courts of law to evade neutral and generally applicable laws.”\n\n“The Constitution’s religious protections provide no authority for religious courts to skirt state and federal laws simply by donning robes and pronouncing positions inconsistent with western civilization,” the governor wrote in the letter. He offered no specific examples of resolved disputes that have violated U.S. law but urged the counties to work with the state’s Department of Public Safety and attorney general, Ken Paxton, who had “additional investigative tools at their disposal.”\n\nFor experts in Islamic law and culture, the move was puzzling.\n\n“The Islamic Tribunal is not unique in Texas or the United States,” said Robert Hunt, a professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas who has written about contemporary Islam. “They’re part of the complication of living as a religious person in a secular society with secular laws.”\n\nThe Islamic Tribunal did not respond to requests for comment. Its website states that it is not a law firm and that it complies with federal and state laws.\n\nThere are only a few established organizations providing formal mediation and arbitration services for Muslim Americans, said Abed Awad, a lawyer in New Jersey whose firm focuses on Sharia-compliant estate planning, among other areas of Islamic law.\n\nBut ad hoc conflict resolution and mediation is common at mosques across the country, including in family law cases involving the division of assets after a divorce and custody disputes.\n\nAn example, Mr. Awad said, is a couple who goes to their imam for help resolving a religious divorce according to Islamic tradition, which a state court cannot grant. The resolution could mean the wife receives fewer assets from the marriage than she would under state law. (Mr. Awad pointed out that fathers carry all the responsibilities of child and family support in the Islamic system.)\n\n“There could be a dispute about that from an American law perspective, but if you are mutually agreeing to it, then it doesn’t violate U.S. law,” he said.\n\nThe governor’s office did not respond to questions about whether it was aware of any specific potential violations of state law and whether entities other than the Islamic Tribunal were implicated in its claim.\n\nThere were so many things wrong with the governor’s letter, “I’m struggling with knowing how to begin,” said Haroon Moghul, a commentator in Ohio who heads a company that runs Muslim leadership retreats. His objections included the governor’s use of the term “Shariah law.”\n\n“Shariah” is not a specific, unified set of laws so much as a concept of divine guidance that humans must interpret, he said.\n\n“We don’t have a pope. We don’t have a centralized religious authority,” Mr. Moghul said. There are multiple branches of Islam, and several traditionally recognized sources of “Shariah,” including community consensus.\n\nBut the term has been used by some for decades in the United States as a catchall signifier suggesting an encroaching Islam that threatens American values.\n\nMr. Abbott’s letter comes amid an increase in anti-Muslim expressions in the state. Muslims represent about 2 percent of the population in Texas, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn September, the governor signed a law banning “Shariah compounds” in the state. The announcement specifically mentioned EPIC City, a proposed development organized by members of a mosque in suburban East Plano that has drawn fierce opposition from Republicans across the state. The developers have said that no laws have been broken.\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Abbott signed a law prohibiting the use of any foreign laws in family court cases in the state, legislation modeled after the work of an anti-Shariah activist in Brooklyn.\n\nMr. Abbott’s declaration this week on the Council on American-Islamic Relations said that the group, known as CAIR, was associated with Hamas and aimed to “forcibly impose Shariah law.” The governor also gave that designation to the Muslim Brotherhood, a group founded in Egypt that has many international offshoots. The designation will prohibit the organizations from acquiring land in Texas.\n\nCAIR filed a federal lawsuit against Mr. Abbott and Mr. Paxton on Thursday. The suit argues that calling the group a terrorist and criminal organization without due process is a violation of federal law.\n\nJ.

and using the term “genocide” for the first time to describe the violence there.\n\n“I think Nigeria is a disgrace. The whole thing is a disgrace,” he said on Fox News Radio’s The Brian Kilmeade Show. “They’re killing people by the thousands. It’s a genocide. And I’m really angry about it.”\n\nMr. Trump threatened to take military action against the country after a campaign by several U.S. lawmakers and religious activists called for more attention to the attacks on Christians.\n\nNuhu Ribadu, Nigeria’s national security adviser, met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon on Friday to discuss Mr. Trump’s allegations.\n\nKidnappings and terror attacks in Nigeria are common and widespread, with more than 8,000 people killed this year alone. But the attacks are not new, and there is no clear evidence to suggest Christians are attacked any more frequently than Muslims.\n\nOn Friday, gunmen abducted at least 52 students from a Catholic school in central Nigeria. On Monday, kidnappers took about 25 Muslim students from a school in the northwestern part of the country. The fate of the kidnapped students is not known.\n\nContrary to Mr. Trump’s claim of a genocide, there are different types of violence happening across the country, with no one-size-fits-all explanation. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation, with by some estimates more than 230 million people. It’s geographically huge and ethnically diverse, with over 300 languages spoken.\n\nEven within a single region, attributing the violence to a single group or motivation is tricky.\n\nJihadist groups are responsible for violence in the northeast against Christians and Muslims. They are also involved in economically motivated attacks by so-called bandits in the northwest.\n\nIn the central part of Nigeria, clashes have long taken place between herders and farmers battling for scarce resources, which also involve ethnic and religious tensions. Lately, these attacks have become more about land grabbing by influential people, according to local residents.\n\nOne unifying factor: Across the country, perpetrators can commit acts of violence with impunity. Few are ever captured or tried, and government and security officials are rarely held accountable for security lapses on their watch.\n\nNigerians have frequently been attacked by jihadist groups like Boko Haram, based in the northeast, whose ideology tells them to attack Christians, as well as Muslims with whom they don’t agree. The most famous case was the kidnapping of the Chibok girls, which happened about a decade ago. Most of those girls were Christian, and there have been many more like it. But the attack took place in a majority Muslim area.\n\nIn the northwest, where one of this week’s abductions took place, there have been many attacks on villages. Some Nigerians use the word “bandits” to describe such perpetrators, and it’s not really clear what they’re motivated by — other than money.\n\nMany of Nigeria’s Christian victims of violence in recent years have been from the central Nigerian region known as the Middle Belt, where there have been frequent herder-farmer clashes. These are inter-communal conflicts over land, as a battle for scarce resources stirs long-held tensions over religion and ethnicity. The region has a mix of Muslims, Christians and animists, and many ethnic groups. But the herder-farmer label lately masks land grabbing attempts by elites, local residents say.\n\nNigeria also has secessionist groups in the southeast who have been carrying out attacks on security forces and sometimes the civilian population, which is largely Christian, as are the secessionists themselves. This conflict dates back more than 50 years, when the self-declared Republic of Biafra tried to break off from the rest of the nation. The resulting civil war left more than one million people dead.\n\nSince Mr. Trump publicly criticized Nigeria for the attacks against Christians, he has designated the nation a Country of Particular Concern, a label reserved for foreign governments with severe religious freedom violations. He has also ordered the Pentagon to prepare to intervene militarily in Nigeria if necessary. He has directed two Republicans in Congress, Representative Riley Moore of West Virginia, and Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, to look into the killings.\n\n“President Trump’s put everything on the table,” Mr. Moore said in an interview this month. “What I’m hoping is we can help them disrupt and defeat these terror networks that are killing these Christians. But we need the Nigerians to step up.”\n\nNigeria is not the first African nation Mr. Trump has accused of genocide. He has also claimed, falsely, that South Africa is carrying out a genocide against white Afrikaners.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/africa/nigeria-school-abduction.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:42:27-05:00","title":"At least 52 Kidnapped From Nigeria School in Second Mass Abduction This Week","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a second mass kidnapping in Nigeria this week, armed men attacked St. Mary’s Catholic school in Niger state, taking at least 52 students and teachers, with the possible number reaching 100.

attack in the country this week.\n\nArmed men attacked the Catholic school in the state of Niger early on Friday, according to Bello Gidi, an aide to the local government, adding that the number of those kidnapped could be as high as 100. A spokesman at the Diocese of Kontagora, where the school is, said a security officer at the school was shot in the attack.\n\nMass kidnappings have become common in Nigeria, including from boarding schools. On Monday, 24 Muslim girls were abducted from a school in the state of Kebbi, which borders Niger state. One student avoided being kidnapped by hiding in a bathroom, and several others managed to escape.\n\nIn previous kidnappings, some victims have been released in exchange for ransoms, but many have not been heard from again. In 2014, the Boko Haram terrorist group abducted almost 300 girls from a school dormitory in Chibok, in the northeast of the country, in one of the best known mass abductions. Some of the students escaped and others were released, but many remain in captivity.\n\nNigeria is under intense scrutiny over what President Trump and some celebrities, including the rapper Nicki Minaj, have framed as the persecution of Christians. Though Christians are often victims of kidnappings and other violent attacks, there is no evidence that they are targeted more than any other group.\n\nBoarding schools in the area of the latest abduction had been ordered to close after the state government received intelligence that there was an increased threat level, Abubakar Usman, a Niger state official, said in a statement. “Regrettably, St. Mary’s School proceeded to reopen and resume academic activities without notifying or seeking clearance from the State Government, thereby exposing pupils and the staff to avoidable risk,” he said.\n\nMr. Usman added that the security agencies had started “a full-scale investigation and search-and-rescue operations” to bring the abductees home.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/health/eli-lilly-one-trillion-value-pharmaceuticals.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"16:25:40-05:00","title":"Eli Lilly Reaches $1 Trillion in Value, Buoyed by Demand for Its Weight Loss Drugs","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eli Lilly, a 150-year-old pharmaceutical company based in Indianapolis, has reached $1 trillion in market value, becoming the first publicly traded healthcare company to do so.

Buoyed by Demand for Its Weight Loss Drugs\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T16:25:40-05:00\n\nEli Lilly, the maker of hugely popular weight loss drugs, has reached $1 trillion in value, becoming the first publicly traded company in health care to hit the milestone.\n\nLilly’s stock has surged in large part because of the company’s success in seizing the biggest potential market in the history of the drug industry: the class of weight loss medicines known as GLP-1s.\n\nThe company’s injection, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, is on track to be the top-selling drug in the world this year.\n\nOnly a handful of publicly traded companies, mostly in technology, have reached the $1 trillion benchmark. Nvidia, the A.I. chip maker, recently became the first publicly traded company worth $5 trillion. The second-most valuable health care company, Johnson & Johnson, is worth about half a trillion dollars.\n\nUnder the watch of Dave Ricks, who became chief executive in 2017, Lilly has added more than $900 billion to its market value.\n\nData as of 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time Friday.\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nRebecca Robbins/The New York Times\n\nAlong the way, the once-sleepy company, which is 150 years old and based in Indianapolis, has become ubiquitous. Zepbound is everywhere and Caitlin Clark wears Lilly’s logo on her Indiana Fever jersey. Mr. Ricks has been touring the podcast circuit and was briefly spoofed this month in a Saturday Night Live cold open.\n\nMr. Ricks has cultivated a relationship with President Trump, dining with him and others at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAnd this month, in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump called Mr. Ricks “one of the hottest people in the world in business.” The two announced a pricing deal, along with other drug company executives and U.S. health officials.\n\nUnder the deal, people will be able to use their own money to pay $449 a month for higher doses of Zepbound, a $50 discount off the current price. The deal will expand coverage for certain people on Medicare and Medicaid and lower the government’s costs for Zepbound, for those eligible, to $245 a month. The agreement has helped fuel a surge in Lilly’s stock price.\n\nOver the past year and a half, Lilly’s main competitor in the weight loss drug market, Novo Nordisk, has faltered. It has been steadily losing market share for its weight loss drug, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy. Investors are unconvinced that Novo Nordisk has a future pipeline of lucrative drugs.\n\nLilly, by contrast, has been developing a daily pill for obesity as well as another promising weight loss injection. These and other products expected to arrive in the next few years are poised to keep revenues flowing.\n\nOver the decades, Lilly has become known for popular and essential products like Prozac and the polio vaccine. Today, Lilly also sells other well-known drugs like Verzenio, for breast cancer; Kisunla, for Alzheimer’s disease; and, most controversially, insulin.\n\nFor years, Lilly was the target of a sustained pressure campaign to lower insulin prices, waged by people with diabetes who said the company’s financial success had come at the expense of patients who could not afford insulin. Without insulin, people with diabetes can die or face serious health consequences, including amputation and kidney failure.\n\nOver two decades, Lilly raised the sticker price of Humalog, its widely used insulin, by more than 1,000 percent. It last increased the sticker price in 2017 to $275 a vial, shortly after Mr. Ricks became chief executive. Patients often need several vials a month.\n\nAbout 550 U.S. states, cities, counties, unions and other payers have sued Lilly, along with other insulin makers and big pharmacy benefit managers, claiming that they inflated insulin prices.\n\nMr. Ricks has repeatedly defended his company’s decisions on insulin. Instead, he has blamed pharmacy benefit managers for driving up sticker prices and exposing patients to huge costs.\n\n“The person who walked in the pharmacy with no insurance, they had to pay that. That’s outrageous,” Mr. Ricks said on a podcast this month. “That should not exist.”\n\nIn 2023, bowing to the public outcry, Lilly slashed the sticker prices of Humalog and other older products and made it easier for many privately insured patients to take advantage of an existing policy that caps their out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 a month. A federal law applied the same cap in Medicare.\n\nLast year, the average monthly out-of-pocket cost for Lilly insulin was $14.86, according to Niki Biro, a spokeswoman for Lilly.\n\nBut doctors and advocates say that despite the changes, insulin remains unaffordable for many patients.\n\nIn a small study published this month, researchers surveyed patients with diabetes who rely on insulin and receive care at Yale Diabetes Center in New Haven, Conn. Despite the pricing changes of the last few years, a quarter of the patients reported rationing their insulin in 2024, the same percentage as those who responded to a similar survey conducted in 2017.\n\nDr. Kasia Lipska, a Yale endocrinologist and the study’s senior author, said the patients still struggling with costs appear to include those with the most limited incomes, those who take multiple insulin products and those who may not know how to obtain their product at the lower prices.\n\n“People get lost navigating this complex web of different Band-Aids that have been placed on the system,” she said.\n\nIn Rockville, Ind., just over an hour’s drive west of Lilly’s headquarters, Molly King, 33, said she was still paying about $200 a month for two vials of Humalog that help keep her alive. Her health insurance is provided by her employer, a public school district, where she works as a special-education teacher.\n\nIt was not clear why Ms. King is not benefiting from the promised cap on out-of-pocket costs. Ms. Biro, the company spokeswoman, said no one should pay more than $35 a month for a monthly supply of Lilly insulin and that the company offers a hotline to help.\n\nIn 2017, when Ms. King was on an Obamacare plan, she was paying a total of $400 a month out of pocket for Humalog and a second insulin product she takes that is made by Sanofi. Unable to afford the cost, she rationed her insulin and wound up in the intensive care unit with diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition that can occur when the body doesn’t have enough insulin.\n\nMs. King now helps lead the Indiana chapter of T1International, an advocacy group for people with diabetes. Watching Lilly’s stock price soar, Ms. King said, has been “infuriating.”\n\nThe company’s origins date to 1876, when a 37-year-old veteran of the Union Army named Eli Lilly opened a small drugstore in Indianapolis. Early products included pills coated in gelatin and a plant-based syphilis treatment. Within a decade, the company incorporated, issued stock and hired a chemist.\n\nToday, the company has 50,000 employees worldwide, about a quarter of whom are in Indianapolis. Lilly has said it will spend $14 billion this year on research and development.\n\nMr. Lilly’s heirs have spent decades distributing the fortune he seeded. In the 1930s, the family set up the Lilly Endowment with gifts of company stock. Today, the foundation gives away money to nonprofits in Indiana and beyond, including to seminaries, churches, museums and national parks.\n\nThe Lilly Endowment, its stock holdings flush from the weight loss drug craze, reported that its assets surged last year to nearly $80 billion — more than those of the Gates Foundation.\n\nAt the start of 2017, the company was worth $81 billion — far shy of industry peers like Johnson & Johnson — when Mr. Ricks became chief executive after spending two decades working his way up the ranks.\n\nNo one knew it at the time, but Lilly’s scientists had already stumbled upon a gold mine. In 2015, the company began seeking patents for a drug it had discovered in-house that looked promising for treating diabetes. In 2022, Lilly started selling it as Mounjaro as a treatment for diabetes and then, a year and a half later, won approval for it to tackle obesity as Zepbound.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Lilly developed and sold a treatment aimed at keeping high-risk patients with Covid out of the hospital, but it stayed out of the vaccine race. The two Covid vaccine makers best known to most Americans, Pfizer and Moderna, have both been mired in slumps in the post-Covid years.\n\nPharmaceuticals is a notoriously cyclical business. Companies buoyed by once-in-a-generation product lines flounder after their blockbuster drugs lose patent protection.\n\n“You literally have to reinvent yourself every 10 to 12 years,” said John LaMattina, who was once the top scientist at Pfizer and is now a senior partner at PureTech Health, a firm that creates biotech start-ups.\n\nBut in his recent podcast interview, Mr. Ricks said the company was trying to do something different with the weight loss drugs. Patients, and the Trump administration, have embraced the direct-sales website that Lilly introduced last year, which allows patients to use their own money to buy the medications.\n\nThere is potential, he said, to “create much more of a self-pay branded business that has staying power beyond the patent cycle.”\n\nBy about March of next year, Lilly is expected to win fast-tracked regulatory approval for orforglipron, the daily weight loss pill it has been developing. Anticipation of the new pill appears high, even though the company’s data shows it to be a bit less effective than the injections.\n\nFor patients who pay using their own money, Lilly plans to charge $149 a month for a starting dose of the pill and $399 for higher doses.\n\nThe company is developing another weight loss injection, retatrutide, that is being closely watched because it appeared to generate more weight loss than the drugs available now when it was tested in a mid-stage clinical trial. Results are expected in the coming months from late-stage studies of retatrutide.\n\nJoe Rennison contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/opinion/zohran-mamdani-trump-meeting-white-house.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:19:25-05:00","title":"Mamdani’s Surreal and Shrewd Pragmatism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected 34-year-old mayor of New York City, has made a bold political debut by forming a pragmatic and unexpectedly cooperative relationship with President Donald Trump, despite their ideological differences.

2025-11-21T20:19:25-05:00\n\nZohran Mamdani visited the White House Friday where he disarmed President Trump, and received a warmer welcome than he had from powerful corners of the Democratic Party at times this year. The meeting between the two men amounted to a thoroughly American experience in political surrealism.\n\nMr. Mamdani requested the meeting with the president, who had during the campaign called him a “communist” and threatened to send the National Guard into New York City. Instead of acrimony, Mr. Trump responded effusively to the city’s new mayor-elect. It was a riveting illustration of Mr. Mamdani’s sharp political instincts and ability to charm even his political rivals if needed, something he and the president share.\n\n“I’ll stick up for you,” Mr. Trump said, defending Mr. Mamdani’s decision to travel to Washington by plane instead of rail. The president called Mr. Mamdani a “rational person.”\n\nFrom the Oval Office, the democratic socialist mayor-elect and the reactionary president began talking about all the things upon which they agree: building more housing and lowering crime; a shared love of New York City. “We had a meeting that actually surprised me,” Mr. Trump said. “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him. A big help, because I want New York City to be great.” Mr. Mamdani stood beside the president with a smile.\n\nIn the days since he was elected, Mr. Mamdani, 34, has handed the bewildered establishment yet another surprise: a vivid display of political shrewdness and pragmatism.\n\nHis early political maneuvering suggests Mr. Mamdani is comfortable taking big risks, forming alliances with political opponents and willing to disappoint ardent supporters if he views the moves as helpful in carrying out his ambitious agenda.\n\nJust consider his choice — celebrated by Mr. Trump on Friday — to retain New York’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, a centrist opposed to the state’s landmark bail reforms whose overall approach to policing falls to the right of many voters in Mr. Mamdani’s base. “She’s a good friend of some of the people in my family,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Tisch.\n\nCrime has generally fallen under Ms. Tisch, who is especially well liked by business leaders and others within the city’s establishment, many of whom pushed to keep her on the job. It seems clear that the long tradition among the city’s mayors of affording the Police Department broad independence from City Hall is set to continue.\n\nBack home in New York, Mr. Mamdani is already playing a complex role in New York’s congressional races, quietly encouraging City Comptroller Brad Lander to challenge Representative Dan Goldman, a Democrat, in New York’s 10th Congressional District, while openly discouraging Councilman Chi Ossé — a fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America — from challenging Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, for his Brooklyn seat across town. Whatever other changes Mr. Mamdani may bring to New York, provoking the House Democratic leadership, at least for now, doesn’t appear to be on his list.\n\nThe day after the election, Mr. Mamdani told the city that his transition team would be filled largely with veterans of previous administrations. Four of the five appointees had worked for other mayors. What’s notable about the appointments is who they aren’t: outsiders, 20-somethings or people with Democratic Socialists of America bona fides. Instead, they’re people with significant experience navigating New York politics or carefully tending the city’s bureaucracy. The exception was Lina Khan, the former head of the Federal Trade Commission under President Joe Biden. At the F.T.C., Ms. Khan showed a zeal for bringing antitrust suits against powerful companies like Amazon and Meta; her name provokes ire among many business leaders.\n\nOn Nov. 10, Mr. Mamdani named Dean Fuleihan as first deputy mayor. Not necessarily a fresh face around City Hall, Mr. Fuleihan first served in government during the Carter administration. A dedicated public servant with a deep knowledge of government, he was first deputy mayor under Bill de Blasio, ran the city’s budget office and helped roll out universal prekindergarten. He’s a serious pick.\n\nA few veterans could come in handy in an administration where many senior aides and staffers are barely in their 30s and their memory of city government runs short. “What will be important is to ensure there is the right balance of transformative leadership and transactional leadership,” Jennifer Jones Austin, who served as a leader of Mr. de Blasio’s transition team in 2013, told me.\n\nThe age of Mr. Mamdani’s team continues to shock the system of even many millennial Democratic strategists, who long ago became accustomed to working with candidates and senior aides who were frequently older than 50. “I need a Gen Z dictionary to get through the day,” Monica Klein, his transition spokeswoman, told me. (She is 36.)\n\nMs. Klein said that more than 62,000 people have so far applied to work for the Mamdani administration since the Nov. 4 election, and that the average age of the applicants is 28. That may not only be a sign of interest in Mr. Mamdani, but also a measure of the pain faced by some of his own voters. The unemployment rate for Americans ages 20 to 24 is more than 9 percent.\n\nAmong the many challenges ahead for Mr. Mamdani is keeping many people, from left to center, happy. Despite his outreach to Mr. Trump and his other moves, there is no suggestion that Mr. Mamdani is backing off from his decidedly leftist agenda. And not all of his appointments are traditional. His chief of staff and closest aide, Elle Bisgaard-Church, is deeply ideologically aligned with Mr. Mamdani (and like him, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America). She is also 34.\n\nThe morning after Mr. Mamdani was elected mayor, New York City, from the panicked corners of the Upper East Side to the progressive enclaves of Brooklyn, wasn’t quite sure what to expect. In the days since, Mr. Mamdani has continued to build relationships outside his base and has signaled he fully intends to enjoy the benefit of insiders.\n\nBucking orthodoxy could work well for the next mayor, as long as it’s in service of the big and heady promises he made to New York City and working people.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

That’s because Earth and Saturn seem to be aligning in what astronomers call a ring-plane crossing. During these events, the ultrathin rings are exactly edge-on to Earth and effectively disappear.\n\nFor this weekend’s event, the crossing will not be complete: Saturn’s rings will appear to narrow to less than 1 percent visible on Saturday before the orbital motions of the two worlds make them appear to widen out again.\n\nWhile the vanishing will not be total, it could be a rare chance to take in such an event: The next opportunity to see a complete crossing will be in 2038, Mr. Peach said.\n\nThe effect occurs because Saturn is tilted on its axis, like Earth (although Saturn takes almost 30 years to circle the sun). The orbits of both planets make Saturn’s rings appear from Earth to widen, narrow and then vanish during ring-plane crossings.\n\nThe crossings occur in groups every 13 to 16 years, but they are not always visible. Saturday’s near crossing follows a complete ring-plane crossing in March, but Saturn was blotted out then by the glare of the sun and could not be observed. A single crossing in 2009 was impossible to see for the same reason, and the last three observed from Earth were in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe rings’ disappearing trick caused confusion when Saturn was first observed through a telescope over 400 years ago.\n\nMichael Shank, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in an email that Galileo Galilei observed Saturn in July 1610 with a “spyglass” he had made himself. But he was perplexed because his primitive telescope couldn’t properly resolve the rings — and because nobody back then suspected planets could have rings.\n\nGalileo concluded that what he had seen were “lateral bodies,” one attached to each side of Saturn itself. He had observed “the highest planet, triple-bodied,” he wrote in code to Johannes Kepler, meaning he had observed Saturn (the farthest or “highest” known planet) and seen that it comprised three objects. (Kepler failed to decipher Galileo’s code correctly, however. He supposed instead that it meant that Mars had two moons, a guess that, centuries later, turned out to be correct.)\n\nGalileo was even more perplexed when he observed Saturn a few years later. His “triple-bodied” planet had become one because the rings at that time were edge-on and invisible in his telescope. A few years later still, however, and Saturn’s rings were visible again. But this time they looked different, so Galileo reasoned they might be “ears” of some sort.\n\nThis confusion lasted until 1659, when the astronomer Christiaan Huygens proposed that what Galileo had seen were actually rings — the first ever found and still the most impressive, although other planets are now known to have much smaller rings.\n\nE.C. Krupp, who has studied the 1990s ring-plane crossings and is the director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, said Galileo did his best with the instruments at hand.\n\n“It was really a marvel he observed as much as he did,” he said.\n\nPhilip Nicholson, an astrophysicist at Cornell University, and his colleagues will use the James Webb Space Telescope to observe Saturday’s near crossing. Most of Saturn’s rings are almost invisible from Earth during a ring-plane crossing, but the lack of glare means it is the best time to study the outermost and very faint e-ring, which scientists think is generated by plumes of ice from Saturn’s moon Enceladus.\n\nThe team will use the near crossing to study light reflected from the vaporous e-ring, with the hope of detecting carbon atoms. That would strengthen the case for habitability in the underground ocean beneath the icy crust of Enceladus, Dr. Nicholson said.\n\nSaturn will be prominent in the southeastern sky after sunset on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. You’ll want to observe it before about 3:30 a.m. local time, when it sets from the night sky.\n\nThe moment the rings look narrowest will be at 7 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, about an hour after Saturn rises, but they are almost edge-on to Earth already and look much the same.\n\nSaturn’s rings will slowly get wider again over the coming months, reaching their greatest apparent width in late 2027.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/business/tyson-lexington-nebraska-closing.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"19:55:13-05:00","title":"Tyson Foods to Shut Major Beef Facility in Nebraska","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tyson Foods has announced the closure of its major beef processing plant in Lexington, Nebraska, effective January 2026, due to historically low cattle inventory and soaring beef prices.

Tyson Foods to Shut Major Beef Facility in Nebraska\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T19:55:13-05:00\n\nTyson Foods, the American meat industry titan, said on Friday that it would close down a major beef processing plant in Nebraska, as the United States faces high beef prices and its lowest cattle inventory in decades.\n\nThe facility, in Lexington, employs more than 3,000 people. Tyson also announced that its beef facility in Amarillo, Texas, would go down to one shift a day.\n\nThe changes are “designed to right-size its beef business and position it for long-term success,” the company said in a statement. To meet customer demand, Tyson said, it will increase production at other beef facilities.\n\n“With these changes, Tyson Foods is ensuring that it will continue to deliver high-quality, affordable and nutritious protein for generations to come,” the statement said. It added that the company would help affected employees apply for jobs at other facilities and provide relocation benefits.\n\nLexington, which is about 170 miles west of Lincoln, Neb., had a population of about 10,000 in 2023, according to census data. The plant is expected to close in January.\n\nOn an earnings call this month, the company, one of the big four meatpackers in the United States, said it expected operating losses between $400 million and $600 million on beef in the next fiscal year.\n\n“As anticipated, the beef segment remains our only soft spot,” Donnie King, the chief executive of Tyson, said on the call with analysts. “Cattle supplies are at record lows due to drought, potential herd rebuilding and the impact of New World screwworm in Mexico,” he added, referring to an invasive fly.\n\nTyson produces one-fifth of chicken, beef and pork in the United States, according to its website.\n\nJBS, another major meatpacker, said in its earnings call this month that “the industry continues to navigate a challenging cattle cycle, with limited cattle availability for processing.”\n\n“With cattle supplies at historically low levels, live cattle prices have remained high, pressuring profitability,” it added.\n\nWashington is adding to the pressure. This month, President Trump accused the country’s largest meatpacking companies of artificially inflating prices and threatening the country’s food supply, and he directed the Department of Justice to investigate.\n\nA White House news release named Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef as targets of the investigation. The companies slaughter 85 percent of the country’s cattle and a majority of its hogs.\n\nA pound of ground beef cost $6.32 in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an increase of 11 percent from a year earlier. The number of beef cattle in the United States is down to 27.9 million, a 13 percent decline since 2019, and the overall cattle inventory is the lowest it has been since 1952, according to the Agriculture Department. Consumer demand has remained steady in recent years.\n\nMr. Trump last week lifted tariffs on beef imports in a bid to increase supply and drive down retail beef prices. In October, he said he would buy beef from Argentina to shore up U.S. supplies and lower costs.\n\nDespite challenges, “we are strengthening our fundamentals by prioritizing efficiency, reducing cost and introducing innovative products,” Mr. King said on the call this month. “This positions us to emerge stronger in beef when market conditions improve.”\n\nKevin Draper contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/world/europe/trash-britain-illegal-dumping.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"13:38:01-05:00","title":"A Colossal, Hidden Pile of Trash Ignites Outcry in Britain","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive pile of trash—approximately 500 feet long and up to four stories tall—was discovered near Kidlington, 60 miles northwest of London, sparking national outrage in Britain.

Britain\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T13:38:01-05:00\n\nIt would almost be majestic, if it weren’t so smelly.\n\nAn enormous wall of trash about 500 feet in length and up to four stories tall was recently discovered near a highway in the English countryside, leading to a national outcry across Britain.\n\nDespite its massive scale, the dump remained hidden from sight for weeks behind a row of trees, leaving many in the country who recently came across images of the heap in disbelief.\n\n“When I was sent the video and pictures, I had to double check and think, is this A.I. or what?” said Liz Gyekye, a spokeswoman for Thames21, an environmental nonprofit. “In terms of the waste tips I’ve seen, this is probably the worst. It’s shocking.”\n\nThe mountain of rubbish near Kidlington, about 60 miles northwest of London, is the latest example of what experts say is a growing problem of criminal organizations profiting from illegal dumping.\n\nAccording to an October report from the House of Lords, “over 38 million tons of waste, enough to fill Wembley Stadium 35 times, is believed to be illegally managed” in the United Kingdom every year, costing around 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion). The House of Lords said that there were currently six similar large-scale dumping sites around the country.\n\nExperts said the issue of illegal dumping, known locally as “fly-tipping,” has worsened in recent years as it has become more expensive to dispose of waste, even as people generate more trash, giving criminal groups a lucrative opportunity.\n\n“These are utterly appalling scenes,” Keir Starmer, the country’s prime minister, said in Parliament this week when asked about the trash heap.\n\nThe country’s environment agency, he added, “will use all available powers to make sure that the perpetrators cover the cost of the cleanup, which must now follow.”\n\nThe pile of trash, which is made up mostly of household waste, was initially reported to the Environment Agency at the end of June. The organization sent the landlord a cease-and-desist order to prevent further dumping, but when it discovered that the heap had grown in October, it closed the site and opened a criminal investigation.\n\nHow so much trash was dumped without anyone noticing is still a mystery. But a landowner next to the site told the BBC that he saw truckloads of refuse dumped there for months this summer under the cover of night.\n\nCalum Miller, a Parliament member who represents the area, said that the site was “well-chosen to hide criminal activity.”\n\nThe field where the trash was dumped was long, thin and flanked by fully grown trees. Its proximity to the highway and side roads most likely made getting into and out of the site relatively easy, he said.\n\nMr. Miller said that an officer at the local waste authority estimated that it would cost more than the local government's annual budget of £25 million to clean up. He called on the environmental agency to move quickly, noting that the area is next to the Cherwell River, which flows into the Thames, a major waterway, and sits in a flood plain that was fully submerged last year.\n\n“There is a local call for the government to act without delay,” he said, “before we face an environmental disaster.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/briefing/trump-mamdani-ukraine-peace-plan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"18:07:12-05:00","title":"Just Two Guys From Queens","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article highlights several major developments: a surprising and positive meeting between President Trump and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, signaling a potential thaw in political tensions; the urgent and controversial U.S.-drafted peace plan for Ukraine, which could lead to significant territorial concessions; a large U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean, possibly aimed at pressuring Venezuela rather than countering drug trafficking; Roblox's new facial-age-verification system in response to child safety concerns; Robert F.

Trump said he expected Mamdani to do some great things as the next mayor of their shared hometown.\n\n“We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,” the president said after the two met privately. “I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually.”\n\nIt was a striking turnabout. Several times, when reporters asked Mamdani pointed questions, the president jumped in to defend him. When the mayor-elect was pressed on whether he thought the president was a fascist, Trump patted him on the arm like he was an old friend: “That’s OK,” Trump told Mamdani. “You can just say yes. That’s easier.”\n\nMamdani, whose campaign argued that only he could stand up to Trump, smiled and nodded along. He called their meeting “productive” and said he believed they could work together to improve life in New York and make it more affordable. It was unclear how much of their private time they’d spent on their shared connection to Queens. (Trump grew up in Jamaica Estates. Mamdani lives in Astoria.)\n\nAt the least, the meeting seemed to defuse Trump’s threats to send National Guard troops into the city or withhold its federal funding. In fact, Trump told reporters: “I would feel very, very comfortable living in New York.”\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky said today that his country was facing “one of the most difficult moments in our history.” The new plan the White House has to end the war would force Ukraine to accept terms it has long considered unacceptable, including the surrender of territory. But if he rejects it, Ukraine risks losing U.S. support.\n\nTrump has given him until Thanksgiving to respond to the 28-point plan, which was drafted by U.S. and Russian officials. The plan would give Russia most of what it has asked for, including sharp limits on Ukraine’s military. In return, Kyiv would receive some security guarantees, including the promise of a military response if Russia invaded again.\n\nFor more: To many Ukrainians, the U.S. peace plan sounds a lot like capitulation.\n\nU.S. Navy warships have since September consistently sailed in an area 50 to 100 miles off the Venezuelan shore, according to an analysis of satellite images verified by our investigative journalists. It is far from the Caribbean’s main drug-smuggling routes, suggesting that the effort is as much about putting pressure on Venezuela as conducting the counternarcotics operation the Trump administration says it’s waging.\n\nThe vessels are part of the largest U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Over the past week, the Navy’s largest and most modern aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, entered the Caribbean Sea, and a U.S. destroyer sailed seven miles from Venezuela’s territorial waters.\n\nThe online gaming platform Roblox is one of the main gathering places for children online, with at least 50 million daily users under the age of 14.

rancorous polarization just gave us the longest ever government shutdown. But one belief has endured on both sides of the aisle: that the world order, built and led by the United States, is under threat from China, which aims to usurp America’s rightful place atop it.\n\nThere’s a phrase that encapsulates the theory: the Thucydides trap, referring to the violent clash that comes when a rising power challenges the ruling hegemon. In Thucydides’ time, it was Athens that threatened — and then made its own — the pre-eminence of Sparta. But it is a pattern that has played out repeatedly through history, with the ambition and aggression of the challenger almost always ending in bloodshed.\n\nPresident Trump’s second term has upended this assumption. With its litany of chaos, the administration has pursued all on its own a root-and-branch destruction of the global order America made — threatening invasions, deploying punitive tariffs indiscriminately and all but abandoning longstanding alliances. China, by contrast, has responded mostly with a steely insistence on the status quo. In a startling reversal, it is America, not China, that seems determined to spring Thucydides’ trap. At the world’s summit, America is overthrowing America.\n\nThe bipartisan consensus, now showing signs of strain, was built on a misreading of China’s intentions. That, at least, is the argument of a provocative recent paper published in the M.I.T. journal International Security by three East Asia scholars. “China is a status quo power concerned with regime stability,” the authors write, “and it remains more inwardly focused than externally oriented.”\n\nThis cleareyed analysis was based on an examination of a vast corpus of Chinese documents and publications, from official speeches to school curriculums. The conclusions were striking. China’s stated territorial concerns, the authors found, do not extend beyond its long-held claim to Taiwan and relatively small border areas. “China’s aims are unambiguous; China’s aims are enduring; and China’s aims are limited,” they write.\n\nMuch of China’s foreign policy, rather than exporting its ideology abroad, is aimed at shoring up the power of the Communist Party at home. What outside observers take to be aggressive moves are often aimed at solving internal problems. Take its Belt and Road Initiative, which some see as a quasi-imperial effort to win the loyalty of developing nations. One of the paper’s authors, Zenobia Chan, a scholar of international relations who teaches at Georgetown University, said that the initiative was driven more by internal considerations than global ambition.\n\n“A lot of it is driven by domestic needs, excess industrial capacity after the global financial crisis,” she told me. China has for the most part not sought to use these investments as leverage for its global ambitions, she added, beyond its longstanding demand that its partners adhere to a One China policy and avoid recognizing the independence of Taiwan. It certainly has not asked developing nations to choose between itself and the United States.\n\nChina, to be sure, is hardly a virtuous or even benign actor on the global stage. Its aggression in the South China Sea, vicious repression in Xinjiang, crackdown on Hong Kong and implacable desire to claim Taiwan — no matter what the Taiwanese people want — pose serious challenges to peace and order in Asia and challenge basic principles of human rights. The escalating diplomatic spat with Japan, suspending seafood imports and advising citizens to avoid travel there, demonstrates China’s capacity for menace.\n\nBut these actions, however brutal, fall far short of a fundamental reordering of the world. China seems to be asserting what it views as historical claims and domestic prerogatives within the existing system, bending the rules in ways the United States, especially under Trump, is hardly in a position to protest. The distinction matters: A power defending the status quo, even aggressively, poses different challenges than one seeking to remake the world in its image.\n\nIt may be outmoded, in any case, to think of a single power superintending the world. “It is not simply that the United States is in relative decline, or even that China is rising, but rather that compared with earlier decades, power is held more widely and by a variety of powers in different regions,” Emma Ashford writes in her bracing new book, “First Among Equals.” “The United States and China are ahead of the pack, but by far less than their Cold War counterparts.” Multipolar complexity, not bipolar confrontation, is the future.\n\nTrump, it’s fair to say, is not responding well to this reality. Of his wild threats, the recent one suggesting military action against Nigeria — on the ground that it “continues to allow the killing of Christians” — is perhaps the most symptomatic of his frustration. The United States, of course, has always played by its own set of rules. But Trump has abandoned even a fig leaf of fealty to principle. “It’s one thing to say: There’s some rules of international law that don’t apply to us,” the political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta told me. “It’s another thing to say: I really don’t care what international law is.”\n\nTrump or no, the military adventurism of the past two decades has become an unmistakable sign of decline. “If we’re having to maintain primacy by invading this country that’s not posing a threat to us and launching a global campaign of antiterror, clearly, we’re on the decline,” Van Jackson, a progressive foreign policy scholar and an author of “The Rivalry Peril,” told me. “It has always been the case in these cycles of history that when the dominant power starts investing and playing this military role globally, you have rising powers who are stepping up, playing a more important economic role globally.”\n\nHistory is littered with examples of the dangers of aggression for declining powers — Spain’s crusading military folly in the 16th century, the late Ottoman Empire’s embrace of ethnic nationalism, Britain’s vain attempt to cling to its unsustainable imperial position between the world wars. Each end the same way: an astonishingly rapid loss of power and prestige on the global stage.\n\nThis might not be exactly what’s happening. For all Trump’s threats of military action abroad, with the exception of the brief airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and the bombing of small boats in the Caribbean, he seems most interested in deploying the military to police American citizens. In part, this may be training troops — as he told the military brass — for adventures abroad. But it’s hard not to think that waging battles against people who live in Democrat-governed cities is an end in itself.\n\nLikewise, Trump’s aggressive tariff warfare has less to do with the world than it seems. The volley was supposedly about leveling the playing field with countries that are “ripping off” America and punishing countries whose policies harm Americans. (Fentanyl is a prime example.) But the recent Supreme Court arguments over Trump’s use of tariffs made clear that these levies raise cash mostly from Americans, bypassing the constitutional power of the purse vested in Congress. The tariffs, in short, looked global but hit locally.\n\nThis leads to an irresistible irony. Far from beating back China, America under Trump may come to resemble it. The country is on its way: obsessed with regime stability and willing to use almost any means to keep its people under control; jealously guarding its near periphery while remaining largely uninterested in leading the world; and building a cult of personality around its autocratic leader in an atmosphere of ethnonationalist triumphalism.\n\nTrump, despite his vituperative campaign rhetoric, has never really been a China hawk, even if some around him have led the charge for more aggressive policies to blunt China’s might. Indeed, he has often lavished praise on Xi Jinping, a man who has the kind of virtually limitless power Trump clearly craves. “President Xi is a great leader of a great country,” Trump cooed at their meeting in South Korea last month.\n\nThis praise comes as the United States is retreating from the multilateral bodies that it helped create — the United Nations, the World Health Organization and more. As for the Group of 20, starting this weekend in South Africa, Trump announced months ago that he would not attend and would dispatch Vice President JD Vance instead. Vance has played the role of finger-wagging attack dog, lecturing Europeans about free speech and dressing down President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. One can only imagine what he might have said in Johannesburg.\n\nBut we will never know, because Trump abruptly announced earlier this month that the United States would boycott the meeting entirely, preposterously claiming that white South Africans were the victims of persecution and genocidal violence at the hands of the country’s Black majority. “No U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue,” Trump wrote on social media. Then on Thursday, the administration changed course again, asking to send a small, low-level delegation after all, though it would not participate in the summit discussions.\n\nChina is playing a much longer and more sophisticated game. Premier Li Qiang, Xi’s top emissary, will be in Johannesburg, accompanied by a vast retinue of officials, ready to talk with the world’s major economies about the problems and possibilities of the emerging multipolar order.\n\nAs its primacy fades, the United States now faces a choice: meet rising nations as respected partners in building a new, more equitable multipolar world or seek the costly, brittle power that comes from domination. Trump has chosen the latter; China, it seems, seeks the former. History tells us which path leads to peace and prosperity, and which is the road to ruin.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Still Being Fought\n\nPublished: 2025-11-21T11:30:12-05:00\n\nAs Al Rockoff, war photographer, picks his way through the maze of waist-high boxes that fill the storage locker he calls home, it would appear near impossible to find anything. Still, Rockoff acts like he knows where everything is.\n\nOver there, his old military uniform. Over here, a computer chess game and war films he has enjoyed. On the ceiling, model planes he built and toy aircraft fashioned from beer cans by street children in Vietnam.\n\nThe locker in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has been outfitted with a bathroom and darkroom but there is nowhere to cook, and the packed boxes are so numerous that there is no longer room for a bed. Rockoff usually sleeps outside on a chair.\n\nHe says that instead of packing all his stuff into a warehouse, “I live in a warehouse.”\n\n“I live humbly,” he said in a recent interview. “I do the best I can.”\n\nHis stuff includes both the relics and the residue of a life largely defined by the years Rockoff spent documenting the ravages of war in Southeast Asia. Rockoff was a U.S. Army photographer in Vietnam and later a freelancer in Cambodia, where on April 17, 1975, he was one of the few to record the end of its civil war as the insurgent Khmer Rouge marched victoriously into the capital, Phnom Penh.\n\nIn 1984, John Malkovich portrayed Rockoff in the movie “The Killing Fields,” which depicted the savagery of the Khmer Rouge takeover. Based on an article by Sydney Schanberg, the New York Times correspondent in Cambodia, the movie focused on the suffering that Dith Pran, Schanberg’s photographer and translator, endured after he was seized by the insurgents.\n\nRockoff hates the film. He’s said it mischaracterized his efforts to protect Dith as somehow flawed.\n\nFor decades, thousands of Rockoff’s unpublished images from that era filled cases that sat amid his sea of belongings. But they were removed from the locker more than a year ago under circumstances that have now become the source of a bitter dispute.\n\nDivining the precise roots of Rockoff’s tumbledown life in Florida, where he has lived since the late 1970s, can be difficult. But certainly a footloose spirit, poverty, intransigence and, most significantly, war, have played their parts.\n\nRockoff, son of a Navy man, joined the Army in 1965 and became a military photographer, working in foxholes in the Vietnamese jungle. He still recalls the scared, accusing looks G.I.s gave his camera, as if worried his picture taking was a precursor to something darker.\n\nAfter Rockoff’s discharge in 1973, he returned to Cambodia, where he developed a reputation for smoking pot and taking risks while photographing the brutal civil war for The Times and others as a freelancer. Some colleagues viewed Rockoff as dangerously reckless. The Associated Press stopped buying his work, convinced the images were not worth the calamity Rockoff seemed intent on hurtling toward.\n\nOnce, at Kampong Chhnang, north of Phnom Penh, shrapnel punctured his heart, sending him into cardiac arrest. A Red Cross field doctor had to slice open his chest to get it beating again. He was flown out of the country for treatment but returned to Cambodia five weeks later.\n\n“He really chronicled what war was like,” said Claudia Rizzi, a journalist and documentary producer, “and what bodies looked like when they are abandoned on a roadside for three weeks and what a field hospital looks like, not the ‘M*A*S*H’ version.”\n\nMany photographs were so grisly, it was clear no newspaper would ever print them.\n\nRockoff admits feeling compelled to show “the blood and guts.”\n\n“Maybe if people saw more of it there will be less of it,” he said recently.\n\nToday, Rockoff, 77, is thin and frail, his skin deeply weathered and tanned, his hair and beard gray and unkempt. His blue eyes remain shiny and piercing, though on a recent visit from a reporter he chose to wear sunglasses along with a dark plaid shirt, wide open at the neck, and baggy blue trousers. A few days earlier he had been hospitalized, and he bent over to show the stitches in his scalp.\n\nWhile he is at times good humored, friends say he is often forgetful and moody, paranoid and quick to anger.\n\n“Al was a complicated figure, clearly much traumatized by his immersion in combat in Vietnam,” said Stephen Heder, an expert on Cambodia at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, who met him in Phnom Penh.\n\nRockoff was diagnosed with PTSD more than 20 years ago and takes medications for it, his ex-wife, Victoria Bornas, said.\n\n“Has he got the weight of his memories with him? Absolutely,” said Mary Patricia Nunan, a journalist and podcaster who has been friends with Rockoff for decades.\n\nIn interviews over a period of days, Rockoff, sometimes lucid, sometimes not, recalled rivalries and friendships, respect for some journalists, disdain for others, and vivid scenes from the day that Phnom Penh fell. He remembered hitching rides on the jeeps and tanks swarming into the capital, his Nikon slung around his neck. His photos captured the Khmer Rouge soldiers, many just teenagers, marching into the city in mud-stained black pajamas, some wearing sandals, others barefoot, cradling AK-47s, M-16s, grenade launchers.\n\nAt least 1.7 million Cambodians would die under the regime of the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, and Rockoff photographed the incipient violence. Government soldiers being marched through the streets to an uncertain fate. Leaders of the deposed regime negotiating for their survival — in vain.\n\nAfter dark that day, Rockoff sought refuge in the French embassy and hid his film in the tank of a broken toilet. Three weeks later, he taped the canisters to his inner thighs when the last foreigners were ordered onto trucks and thrown out of the country.\n\n“I didn’t want the Communists to take them from me,” he said in the interview. “I did OK. I got my shit out.”\n\nRockoff has never really capitalized on most of those images, or those he took on many trips to Cambodia after it opened up again in the 1990s, although on one trip in 2000, he put on a rare sale of his prints in Phnom Penh.\n\n“He didn’t want to make money off that misery,” said Bornas, his ex-wife, who serves as something of a caretaker for him.\n\nMoney has never been a motivator for Rockoff, who gets by these days on an Army disability pension and Social Security. Work has been sporadic, and he has largely resisted efforts to help him market his work. Nunan said a publisher tried to get Rockoff to consider a book, but he angrily dismissed the idea, wanting to retain control of his work. Many friends agree that perhaps his most consistent trait is his difficulty in accepting, or appreciating, help.\n\n“I am more interested in my pictures than people’s admiration,” Rockoff said when asked about efforts to display or sell his work. “I am not winning a popularity contest.”\n\nHe has over the years talked of building a book on his own terms before he dies, but he has not made much progress.\n\n“We joked that he didn’t really want to finish the book because the day he finished that book he would die,” Rizzi said.\n\nTo ever complete such a project, Rockoff would need all those negatives and slides he had stored away in plastic cases as the clutter of his locker built around them.\n\nBy last year, the mess had grown to the point where the landlord threatened eviction.\n\n“THE WAREHOUSE YOU CURRENTLY RENT FROM ME IS A FIRE HAZARD,” the notice said.\n\nFor months, two men had already been helping to clean the mess up. But some of Rockoff’s longtime friends now worry that the tidying up went entirely too far.\n\nOne of the men who helped Rockoff was an old friend, Arch Hall Jr., 81, a former actor and pilot who had flown relief supplies into Phnom Penh and now lives in Florida.\n\nThe other was Brad Bledsoe, Hall’s friend from Indiana. Bledsoe, something of a Vietnam War buff and collector, had heard of Rockoff from “The Killing Fields,” and told Hall he’d be interested in meeting him.\n\n“The first day we discovered him, we went down there, I tell you, he looked like near death,” Hall said.\n\nRockoff’s difficulties had deepened as his health deteriorated from a variety of ailments. Cataracts were affecting his sight and a stroke earlier in 2023 had caused him to fall, gash his head and spend weeks in the hospital.\n\nBledsoe and Hall began taking him out to meals and bought him clothes, an iPhone and iPad, a refrigerator, microwave, radios, a reclining chair and an inflatable bed that he ended up not using much.\n\n“If it was not for me and Arch, he would be dead a year,” Bledsoe, 59, said in an interview.\n\nBledsoe took a particular interest in Rockoff’s photographs. Though he works in aerospace engineering — just where, he will not say — he has experience with auctions and estate sales. The website for Aether Estate Services lists him and his wife as the operators of franchises in Indiana and Florida, though Bledsoe said the Florida business is inactive and the Indiana one is really run by his wife. He only helps a bit, he said.\n\nIn early 2024, Bledsoe and Hall had Rockoff sign some prints left over from his 2000 Phnom Penh exhibition. Bledsoe said he would try to market them. He later printed out others for Rockoff to see and created a website with the potential to sell and draw attention to Rockoff’s work. At the same time, Bledsoe and Hall stepped in to clean and reorganize Rockoff’s home.\n\n“I am so happy that you are willing to help,” Bornas wrote in a text to Bledsoe.\n\nBledsoe said he found important items on the floor, such as a letter to Schanberg, the correspondent, and a telegram to Rockoff’s mother alerting her that her son had been hospitalized after being hit by shrapnel.\n\n“What’s amazing about Al, he saved everything,” Bledsoe said. “But it’s randomly thrown around and scattered like confetti, and you are walking on it, you are stepping on it.”\n\nWhen the eviction seemed imminent, Bledsoe hired a dumpster for lesser items and threw some things out. The landlord backed off.\n\nMonths later, though, Bornas said she noted that Rockoff’s most important possessions — the cases that contained his negatives — appeared to be missing. He hadn’t noticed, she said, possibly because he thought they were safe.\n\nGetting Rockoff to remember how he felt about an event months ago in his life is daunting. He is mercurial and often overtaken by anger when pressed to focus. But Bornas recalls how upset she was and how she had complained to the landlord and also contacted friends.\n\nIn one March email to a friend, she wrote: “Bledsoe was able to talk Al into giving him his entire collection of negatives, which Brad now has in his possession.”\n\nBledsoe said Rockoff asked him to rescue the images before they were lost or damaged. “Multiple times Al told me he wanted me to preserve his legacy and be the guardian over his legacy,” he said.\n\nThe website he is building is intended to honor Rockoff’s work, he said, and would help the photographer live a more comfortable life. Bledsoe said he and Rockoff made a handshake agreement to split any income until he had recouped the cost of building the website and caring for Rockoff during his visits to Florida. After that, all income would go to Rockoff, he said.\n\n“Look, I said, ‘A book’s fine, but it’s a lot of work. Let’s start with the website,’” Bledsoe said. “My goal is a comrade-in-arms kind of thing.”\n\nHall agreed with Bledsoe’s account. “We discussed merchandising,” he said. “We discussed there would be great T-shirt slogans. Everything to try to help Al.”\n\n“He begged Brad to save his life’s work because it was in terrible shape,” Hall said. Some of the negatives, he said, were already nearly ruined.\n\nBut Bornas and Rizzi expressed concern that after more than a year, Bledsoe has not provided an inventory of what he took or a document stipulating how Rockoff’s images would be sold and the revenues divided.\n\nStill, Rockoff has refused to make any kind of formal complaint about the negatives and has never directly complained to Bledsoe.\n\n“A big part of the issue here is Al,” said Nunan, his friend. “He has never taken steps to professionally protect himself, and that left the door open so that it looks like he has been taken advantage of.”\n\nBledsoe said there had been no time to draw up a contract given the urgency of saving Rockoff’s work. Inventorying such a large collection, he added, is too massive a project for him to take on given his full-time job. He said he is open to a more formal written agreement now, but he and Hall want to hear from Rockoff directly and find it impossible to reach him. They say they fear he has been manipulated to reject what he once agreed to.\n\nTheir perspective: Who could be against an effort to create a website to rescue Rockoff and put the spotlight back on a man whose work deserves to be at the center of any conversation about war photography?\n\n“I have no problem with returning some of Al’s items or all of his items as long as I am compensated for my expenses first, per our agreement,” Bledsoe said.\n\nIt’s true that Rockoff found it difficult to operate the phone that Bledsoe gave him and that Bornas is now avoiding Bledsoe’s calls.\n\n“Al has been left out of this,” she said in an interview. “They are doing this on their own. Al never asked him to print up his photos and sell them.”\n\nBornas acknowledges she was once supportive of the website but she said she thought it was designed to present a small selection of Rockoff’s images, not a commercial enterprise potentially involving all of his life’s work.\n\nThe dispute is at something of a stalemate. Nothing is yet for sale on the website, which is registered to Bledsoe but where the pages are clearly marked to indicate that Rockoff holds the copyright. Recently, there has been renewed concern about the conditions at Rockoff’s locker, a new eviction notice and an incident to which the police responded.\n\nIf Rockoff were to die, Bledsoe said he would likely continue the website until he had been reimbursed, give some proceeds to Bornas, and then donate the negatives to a museum.\n\nBut Rockoff is not dead, and his voice has often been absent from the debate. All parties appear to agree that he forgets things. Did he consent once and now has changed his mind? Could he consent, given his issues with memory and PTSD? Did Bledsoe and Hall interpret something more than Rockoff meant?\n\nRockoff reacts with rage when pressed on the matter.\n\n“I didn’t give him anything,” he said. “If he has them, he has got to give them back.”\n\nThe images are in many ways his messy children. They remain the organizing principle of his life, and he brightens when he discusses working to order them and even one day the dream of a book, however remote.\n\n“I have a lot of work to do before I pass on,” he said. “I will be working at it when I die.”\n\n"}]}
