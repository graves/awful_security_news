Inside the store, rows of tortillas and shoulder-high stacks of canned hominy sit largely untouched, while the jewelry and travel kiosks are dark.\n \n\n   \n  A phone rings inside the store’s main office, and seconds later, Duran’s manager comes out. It was a tipster with intel that just a week ago  would have sounded  implausible:\n \n\n   \n   Suspected Customs and Border Patrol vehicles have been seen at a gas station a couple of blocks away. \n \n\n   \n  The manager walks over to the store’s entry and stands watch, ready to lock the front door at the first sign of federal agents. Her friendly eyes turn slightly dark.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t have no right to be in here,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  All along Central Avenue, the heart of this immigrant business community in East Charlotte, stark black-and-white signs now posted outside most businesses warn: “ICE is not welcome here.”\n \n\n   \n  The immigration action called Operation  Charlotte’s Web  has shocked and frightened the community, with hundreds of arrests and dozens of minority-owned businesses closed out of fear for their customers and their workers. Manolo’s Bakery, one of the most popular businesses in the neighborhood,  shuttered Saturday  after people were tackled outside the store by men in green uniforms.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte is the latest stop in a virtual four-corners tour of the country by Border Patrol Chief Control Agent  Gregory Bovino  and his agents, who this year have made weekslong visits to Los Angeles and Chicago, with  New Orleans  expected next. In contrast to their Windy City presence, Bovino and at least some of his team  left Charlotte  on Thursday, a Homeland Security official said, as elevated immigration enforcement continues.\n \n\n   \n  The strong shows of force against migrants in Democratic-led cities have become a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s intense immigration enforcement agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In the Charlotte area, more than 250 people were  arrested  over four days of immigration raids, the Department of Homeland Security  said  Wednesday. “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the agency  said .\n \n\n   \n  “Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin  said  in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, a protest outside Manolo’s against the federal effort builds throughout the day, growing to dozens of people and stretching the strip mall’s small parking lot to its limits.\n \n\n   \n    As popular bakery closes, community rises in support\n \n\n   \n  The demonstration began with just one man.\n \n\n   \n  Jerry Ortiz stands  alongside Central Avenue , waving a massive Puerto Rican flag featuring a tree frog called the coquí – with a songlike call that sounds like its name – as passing drivers honk their support. The frog, a native of Puerto Rico like Ortiz himself, is an important symbol of the island’s culture.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the car horns are music to his ears.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s beautiful,” Ortiz says.\n \n\n   \n  But not every note of Central Avenue’s cacophony supports his message.\n \n\n   \n  “Get them illegal sons of bitches out of here!” yells the passenger in one truck as it passes Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not an entirely surprising message in a county where  a third  of the votes cast in the last presidential election were for Donald Trump. Ortiz shrugs.\n \n\n   \n  “Something is wrong that they don’t appreciate us here,” he says. “We come here to work hard, to make this country better.”\n \n\n   \n  While Ortiz keeps watch along the street,  bakery owner  Manolo Betancur stops by several times a day to make sure federal agents haven’t returned and to talk to the growing crowd that cheers loudly as he raises a large American flag alongside the coquí.\n \n\n   \n  “My biggest concern right now is our children need to have their fathers and mothers next to them,” Betancur says.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of these people are so scared, they’re not going to have Thanksgiving (dinner),” adds Ortiz, standing a few feet from the locked entrance to Manolo’s.\n \n\n   \n  Even as the fear forced Betancur to close his business, supporters are still paying for cakes from Manolo’s through the bakery’s website. He contacts them to make sure they understand he can’t fulfill the order right now.\n \n\n   \n  “They say, ‘No, it’s a donation,’” says Betancur.\n \n\n   \n  More protesters show up outside Manolo’s as midday approaches. Brandi Yanes is supporting people who now feel the pain she felt in 2018, when her husband was  detained by ICE  after a sheriff’s office identified him as undocumented following an altercation at a bar, she says.\n \n\n   \n  “Once he came home, my daughter was 6 months old. He had four months with us, and then he had to self-deport to Honduras,” Yanes says.\n \n\n   \n  Though they talk on the phone almost daily, Yanes’ daughter hasn’t seen her father in person in eight years.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, with (immigration agents) being back here, and she’s seeing what’s going on, she’s waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning, crying,” says Yanes. “She’s asking, ‘Are my friends going to be OK?’”\n \n\n   \n  Betancur looks on at the crowd, growing to dozens by midafternoon, with appreciation.\n \n\n   \n  “If it weren’t for the immigrant community, I wouldn’t have a business,” says Betancur. “They are my customers. They are my employees.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the economic losses he is facing, Betancur has the one thing that is priceless for any immigrant: citizenship. He now carries his US passport with him everywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n    Immigrants made the community what it is, neighbors say\n \n\n   \n  Dianna Ward gave up a high-paying corporate career to start her own tour business, and she knows how to weave in history lessons at Charlotte’s hot spots. But when showing off the Plaza Midwood neighborhood where she lives, she chooses an unlikely starting point:  Evergreen Cemetery .\n \n\n   \n  “Look over here,” she says, pointing to a row of headstones from the 1940s. “It’s all Greek.” Other graves show the names of Italian and Jewish residents who helped build the community.\n \n\n   \n  “This has always been an immigrant community,” says Ward. “Immigrants claimed it and have done a beautiful job of making this a place you want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Ward points to million-dollar historic homes, Vietnamese restaurants, an Irish pub and bohemian art as signs of her  neighborhood’s diversity .\n \n\n   \n  “But this is my favorite place,” she says while passing the Central Avenue location of Tacos El Nevado. It is noon, and the restaurant is completely dark, chairs stacked up on the tables.\n \n\n   \n  “It is usually so packed in this restaurant, but look at it now.”\n \n\n   \n    Some stores stay open, even with fewer workers and customers\n \n\n   \n  With the earlier  threat of federal agents  turning out to be false alarm, things pick up a bit by midday at the Sav/Way, where the bustling lunch counter is serving up massive tortas piled impossibly high with meat and jalapeños.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike an average day before Operation Charlotte’s Web, there is no 30-minute wait to be served.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we lose money, we need to keep it open if we can,” says Sav/Way owner Rudy Montero, whose weathered face and gray moustache are the only visible signs of his 72 years. After decades of seven-day weeks running the store, Montero still comes every day to take deliveries and energetically supervise.\n \n\n   \n  “You need to be positive all the time,” says Montero. “I feel terrible about this, but we need to keep going.”\n \n\n   \n  Montero’s positivity is matched by one of his most enthusiastic lunch counter customers, Jesse Pacheco-Anguiano. Wearing a beaded crucifix over the number “7” on his shirt in honor of Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, he gives new visitors the lowdown on his favorites.\n \n\n   \n  “The Cubana is a big, big torta,” he emphasizes. “Do you have a big appetite?”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano is a home renovation contractor who  depends on day laborers , including a worker he saw being picked up by Border Patrol agents in their now-familiar green uniforms and facemasks at a Lowe’s on Saturday, the first day of the Charlotte operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I was born and raised here in Charlotte my whole life, and this is the first time in my life I’ve seen this happen,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano says the agents left him alone after checking his driver’s license, but agents drove away with his worker in two unmarked crossovers, leaving a half-loaded stack of lumber still sticking out of the back of the customized work van with the name of his business covering both sides.\n \n\n   \n  “Look at this. They’re embarrassing me,” he says in Spanish in a cell phone video of the encounter he took and shared with CNN. DHS has not responded to CNN’s questions about this incident.\n \n\n   \n    The crackdown becomes a costly burden on small businesses\n \n\n   \n  With his business effectively shut down, Pacheco-Anguiano joins the protesters when he can. Starting his own business was a long-time dream, and he wants to use what he has to help those who can’t speak up.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just trying to protest for my people who don’t have a voice, and I’m here for them,” Pacheco-Anguiano says.\n \n\n   \n  The full economic impact of the immigration enforcement operation is not clear, but CharlotteEAST, a nonprofit community organization, says small businesses  are struggling .\n \n\n   \n  “For a little tienda, (it’s costing) $400 a day. A hair salon, $500. A restaurant, $5,000 a day,” says the executive director, Greg Asciutto.\n \n\n   \n  His group looks out for about 400 mom-and-pop businesses in East Charlotte, about half of them owned by immigrants, Asciutto says.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, our whole commercial thoroughfare is shut down, right?” he says. “And these are American citizens. These are American-owned businesses.”\n \n\n   \n  The economic strain is showing not just on business owners but also on workers. Even as the immigration raids go on, Pacheco-Anguiano continues to get calls from workers asking for a gig, telling him they have no choice as their money begins to dry up, he says.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re willing to take the risk, but I’m like, ‘Dude, I can’t have that on my conscience if anything happens on the way from here to your house,’” says Pacheco-Anguiano.\n \n\n   \n    Community members show support with their dollars\n \n\n   \n  With Manolo’s Bakery closed, Pacheco-Anguiano moves down Central Avenue to Panadería Odalys, where traditional Latino pastries sit alongside doughnuts and slices of vanilla-iced cake with sprinkles, loading up a pan of treats for family and friends.\n \n\n   \n  About half of the display cases are  uncharacteristically empty , a sign of the difficulty owner Cervantes Almanza is having in finding enough staff who feel safe going to work. But he points to the 5-foot-high racks of baked goods just rolled out into the center of the store.\n \n\n   \n  “Have some. They’re fresh!” says Almanza in Spanish, an announcement made redundant by the aroma that quickly fills the room.\n \n\n   \n  A new customer is unprepared for the store’s cash-only policy, but Almanza gives a silent wave and head shake to show this one is on the house, his gratitude for the community’s support. (A veteran Odalys customer quietly slips money over the counter to pay the bill while Almanza isn’t looking.)\n \n\n   \n  Since Lolo Pendergrast found out Odalys was open but struggling with a reduced staff, she buys as many pastries as she can stuff into an oversized delivery box.\n \n\n   \n  “I got a whole bunch now, and I’m just going around town and handing them out to protesters,” she says.\n \n\n   \n  Pendergrast is retired from teaching English as a Second Language at Merry Oaks International Academy, a public elementary school.\n \n\n   \n  “The people that live right next to it, they’re our friends, our neighbors, you know, and they’re not illegal,” said Pendergrast. “I do not understand how we’ve gotten so off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n    Keeping an eye out for the ‘ Migra’ \n \n\n   \n  Almanza stays vigilant, looking out his bakery’s front door. His workers pick up on a sudden change in mood that takes the air out of the room. The owner doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to.\n \n\n   \n  As Almanza quietly slides the door open for a closer look,  a panicked voice  shouts from behind the building.\n \n\n   \n  “ Migra !  Migra !” a woman yells, feverishly ringing a cowbell.\n \n\n   \n  She runs fast through a residential street into the back of the Odalys parking lot, tailing a pair of unmarked vehicles that quickly blast a siren at oncoming traffic before making sharp right turns onto Central Avenue. Another vehicle follows, with a protester lying on the horn.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to make sure everybody’s good,” the woman says, now leaning over with a hand on one knee to catch her breath before returning to work.\n \n\n   \n  The Odalys employees  feel some relief  as they go back to their jobs, but a reminder of the toll this is taking on the neighborhood remains just outside their windows. Next door, the popular Salvadoran restaurant Morazán remains closed, the parking lot empty.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m born and raised in East Charlotte,” says neighbor Jorge Neri-Moreno, standing next to the shuttered restaurant, “and seeing all this breaks my heart.”\n \n\n   \n    Some children skip class, and volunteers try to keep schools safe\n \n\n   \n  Outside Shamrock Gardens Elementary School, parents Patricia Hoke and Laura Blum sit in lawn chairs at the entrance on Anne Street, a large handwritten poster next to them saying, “NO ICE.” They’re part of a network of volunteers waiting outside  local schools  during drop-off and pickup hours with whistles around their necks, watching for federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea is if we see them, we alert,” Blum says. “And I think it’s just a presence for people to know their community’s behind them.”\n \n\n   \n  There have been no immigration raids outside Charlotte schools so far, but the mothers’ work mixes a strong sense of purpose with a lingering sense of paranoia.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone feels on edge, even though it’s quiet,” says Hoke.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students – about 20% of district enrollment – were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said.\n \n\n   \n  To make sure as many East Charlotte schools as possible are covered, many parent volunteers are now communicating using encrypted messaging apps, just in case they’re being monitored themselves.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned to use Signal yesterday,” says Blum with a slight smile.\n \n\n   \n    Some businesses stay open – but locked up\n \n\n   \n  Before getting back to the protests – his new job for the time being – Pacheco-Anguiano has one more stop to make, pulling his work van into the parking lot at La Reina de las Carnitas, where the smell of fried pork and freshly made tortillas usually draws an overflow crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Owner Ricardo Albarrán immediately gives Pacheco-Anguiano a smile and a fatherly arm around the shoulder. The visitor didn’t just come here for food. Just a few years earlier, Pacheco-Anguiano worked here before striking out on his own with the renovation business. Now, he wants to  check up on  his old boss.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán says he closed at 2 p.m. on the day Operation Charlotte’s Web started and stayed closed through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On the first day he tried to reopen the shop, only two employees showed up for work. The rest were too afraid. Now, Albarrán keeps the front deadbolt latched until a worker at the door is comfortable that whoever is approaching is a customer.\n \n\n   \n  “Every business is doing the same thing to protect the people,” he says in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán sees would-be customers doing their own surveillance, trying to figure out whether an officer in the parking lot, or even just an SUV with tinted windows, might be from Border Patrol, making the short trip from a car to his door too risky.\n \n\n   \n  “ ¿Sí o no? ¿Sí o no? ” they seem to be asking themselves as they assess the level of danger, he says.\n \n\n   \n  Albarrán has  enormous pride  in his business, he says as he begins speaking in English for emphasis.\n \n\n   \n  “I came from Mexico, and this is my dream,” he says. “All countries have good people. I don’t know why (this is happening).”\n \n\n   \n  Pacheco-Anguiano gets another pat on the shoulder and heads out, happy to see his old workplace has been able to stay in operation. But as he exits the carnicería, the sound of the door lock clicking behind him is a stark reminder of the reality his community is still facing.\n \n\n   \n  “You know how they say they come for criminals?” he asks. “I think that’s not right. Because we’re here just trying to get a job done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dianne Gallagher and Lacey Russell contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/style/superman-attic-most-expensive-comic-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:10:00-05:00","title":"Superman #1 copy found in attic becomes most expensive comic ever sold","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A copy of Superman #1, discovered in the attic of a home in northern California by three brothers after their mother's death, sold for $9.12 million at Heritage Auctions, becoming the most expensive comic ever sold.

The 1939 comic had been kept in a cardboard box, protected by just a pile of old newspapers.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless the comic, which originally sold for 10 cents, was found to be so well preserved that it was deemed the “highest ever graded copy” by Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions, which made the record-breaking sale on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers, who have not been named, found a collection of old comics while clearing out their mother’s property over the holiday season last year, the auction house said in a  press statement  issued before the sale. Their mother had always told them she had a valuable collection of comics, but they had never seen the prized editions for themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Up in the attic they discovered five early issues of “Action Comics,” the anthology from National Allied Publications that first introduced Superman to the world. But it was the copy of “Superman #1,” the first time Clark Kent’s alias appeared in his own dedicated comic after National Allied became Detective Comics, Inc. — or DC as it is now famously known — that proved most promising.\n \n\n   \n  The late owner had bought the comics with her brother between the Great Depression and World War II and later in life the pair had decided to pass them on to her sons, as the brother never married or had children.\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of the three brothers, who are in their 50s and 60s, said in the auction house statement: “This was never just about a collectible. This is a testament to memory, family and the unexpected ways the past finds its way back to us.”\n \n\n   \n  The comics had been a “treasured refuge” for the siblings who had grown up in a cramped apartment with few luxuries, he said. “But they had each other and a shared love for comic books,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He said the box had been hidden in the “recess of the attic,” adding: “But as the years unfolded, life brought about a series of losses and changes. The demands of everyday survival took center stage, and the box of comics, once set aside with care and intention, was forgotten. Until last Christmas.”\n \n\n   \n  What set the comic’s valuation so high was not just its superior condition, but the fact that it had been part of DC’s first print run of half a million copies, the auction house said.\n \n\n   \n  Lon Allen, vice president of Heritage Auctions, said in a  statement  published after the sale that he was “thrilled” by the result, adding: “Superman #1 is a milestone in pop culture history, and this copy is not only in unprecedented condition, but it has a movie-worthy story behind it. I was glad to see the price reflect that and am honored Heritage was entrusted with this iconic book.”\n \n\n   \n  The previous record was held by a copy of “Action Comics No. 1,” which introduced Superman in 1938, which was sold by the same auction house for $6 million last year.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to that, another issue of the Man of Steel’s adventures in “Superman #1” took the crown in 2022, fetching $5.3 million in a private sale.\n \n\n   \n  In the years since his first appearance, Superman has become one of the most recognizable and enduring characters in American pop culture, spawning blockbuster movies, books, toys and even bubble gum.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/world/students-kidnapped-nigerian-catholic-school-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:51:00.000-05:00","title":"Students Kidnapped from Nigerian Catholic School Amid Outrage Over Violence Against Christians","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Nigeria’s Niger State, armed bandits abducted an unknown number of students—estimated at up to 52—from St. Mary’s Catholic school, following similar attacks in neighboring Kwara and Kebbi states, where worshippers and students were killed or taken.

abducting an unknown number of students from their hostels amid widespread outrage over ongoing concerns about violence against Christians in the West African nation.\n \n\n   \n  The abduction in Niger, which borders Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, follows a similar  attack on a church  by gunmen in neighboring Kwara State earlier in the week. During the church attack, at least two people were killed, and several worshippers, including the pastor, were abducted.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, this week, armed men  kidnapped 25 female students  when they stormed a government girls’ boarding school in northwestern Kebbi State. Tragically, the school’s vice principal was shot and killed during this attack.\n \n\n   \n  The Niger State government  condemned  the latest attack on St. Mary’s School, stating that “the exact number of abducted pupils is yet to be confirmed.”\n \n\n   \n  However, local television station Arise News estimates that up to 52 students were abducted from the school.\n \n\n   \n  The Niger police command issued a statement Friday indicating that security forces have deployed to the area and are “combing the forests” in an effort to rescue the abducted students.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria is currently facing a concerning wave of attacks by armed groups that target vulnerable civilian populations and orchestrate mass abductions for ransom. The country is also plagued by religiously motivated attacks and other violent conflicts stemming from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water resources.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has frequently expressed outrage over disputed allegations of a  “mass slaughter” of Christians  by Islamist insurgents in Nigeria and has threatened military action to protect this religious group.\n \n\n   \n   Earlier this month , Trump designated Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US  International Religious Freedom Act , suggesting that his administration has determined Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  The recent string of attacks coincides with the arrival of a Nigerian delegation in Washington for discussions with US government officials.\n \n\n   \n  A Pentagon official confirmed a meeting that took place on Thursday between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Nigeria’s National Security Adviser, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu.

administration rushes to emulate Gaza plan in new push for Ukraine Deal \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Believing they have  a new window of opportunity  to restart peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump administration officials are rushing ahead with a new framework to end the Ukraine war modeled after the Gaza deal President Donald Trump pushed, despite little initial input from Ukrainian or European allies, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  The push to restart talks reemerged as a top priority for the president in recent weeks — shortly after the US helped broker a ceasefire in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has indicated he wants to expedite the timeline for ending the war in Ukraine, hoping to conclude a conflict he once said publicly would be the easily resolved, the sources added. Some US officials have said that the administration wants Russia and Ukraine to agree to a deal by the end of the year, according to two sources.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing war, now approaching its fourth year, has fueled the frustrations of a US president who regularly touts his dealmaking ability and believes he has not received enough credit for overseeing other recent diplomatic successes, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, several top Trump administration officials have turned their focus back to the war in Ukraine and the US has considered enlisting some of the same foreign intermediaries who helped facilitate negotiations related to Gaza – including Qatar and Turkey – to play a more prominent, but still behind the scenes, diplomatic role, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The framework for peace that emerged on Thursday, which US officials cautioned was not a final proposal, mirrored elements of the Gaza ceasefire while including components that Russian diplomats have pushed and Ukrainian officials have previously rejected.\n \n\n   \n  Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, which is being overseen by a Trump-led “Board of Peace,” the draft proposal describes the Ukraine peace implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump,” according to a draft seen by CNN. The draft’s veracity was confirmed by a US official.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan includes elements such as territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia, a limit on the size of Ukraine’s armed forces and a Ukrainian commitment in its constitution that it will not join NATO, the draft said. Reports emerged earlier this week that President Trump’s top envoy Steve Witkoff was working with Russia on the framework, which includes the Russian maximalist demands.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff has been working with Russian Special Envoy and the head of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund Kirill Dmitriev directly for many months and the two have remained engaged in crafting this new draft proposal, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As Europeans monitored reports that emerged on Tuesday that Witkoff had worked exclusively with Russian officials to develop the plan, some were on edge, according to six sources familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Europeans who said they had not been briefed on the details grew concerned about what the effort could mean for Ukraine – given their longstanding position that Ukraine must be involved in any discussions about a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Wednesday night, Secretary of State Marco Rubio tweeted that ending the war would require “an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas.” Rubio added that the Trump administration would continue “to develop a list of potential ideas” to end the Ukraine war, without saying any final proposal was being floated.\n \n\n   \n  Some Europeans let out a collective sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday nerves were up, today nerves are down,” said a diplomat based in Brussels on Thursday, explaining that Rubio’s tweet had appeared to chill the idea that a firm new deal was on the table that the US would be urging Ukraine to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “The president lets hundreds of flowers bloom,” the diplomat added, pointing to the possibility that the efforts could have been driven by Witkoff freelancing, but also noting that he is one of few people who has the official green-light do that from the president.\n \n\n   \n  A senior State Department official said that Rubio “was reiterating a point he has made for months – a diplomatic end to the war requires both sides to make concessions, and that cannot happen without ongoing dialogue.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that both Witkoff and Rubio “have been working on a plan quietly for about the last month.” She would not go into details of the plan, saying that it’s “ongoing” and “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt acknowledged that the administration was taking cues from its playbook on the Gaza ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Witkoff and Rubio, she said, have “been engaging with both sides, Russia and Ukraine equally, to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you get to a peace negotiation, right? That’s how it worked with Israel, with respect to Israel and Gaza and all of the Arab countries in the Middle East,” she said at a press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The new push comes just after  recent reports of corruption  inside Ukraine, which some administration officials believe leaves the Ukrainian government in a weakened state, and some Europeans are concerned about the US seeking to leverage that weakness.\n \n\n   \n  Still, other Europeans diplomats believe that a continued push towards a peace agreement is useful. One European diplomat explained that they viewed Witkoff’s current efforts as a natural evolution of continued US strategy to drive a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to look at it as an evolution of a negotiation. You take out points, dial up points… the two sides won’t get an agreement overnight,” the European said.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has not publicly endorsed the ongoing efforts. The Kremlin denied it is working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine this week, saying Thursday there were “no new developments” following a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if Russia and the US are currently working towards an end to the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that “there are no consultations as such currently underway. There are certainly contacts. But there is no process that could be called consultations. It is not ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  As of last week, Rubio still publicly said his assessment was Russia did not want peace.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve stated clearly what they want is they want the rest of Donetsk, and obviously the Ukrainians aren’t going to agree to that,” he told reporters after a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the assessment we have to make,” he said. “They’ve made a demand that Ukraine can’t agree to, and so that’s sort of where we are at this point.”\n \n\n   \n  When the top US diplomat spoke with his Russian counterpart by phone last month, officials felt that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, a source familiar with the matter said at the time. Potential meetings between Rubio and Lavrov and Trump and Putin did not move forward, despite Trump saying just a week prior that he planned to meet the Russian president.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials said that the reported plan is not the final product, and the fact that it has a number of items that had been pushed by Russia and previously rejected by Ukraine does not mean that is the expectation for an agreement at the end of the ongoing talks – including talks with Ukrainians.\n \n\n   \n  The plan was presented on Thursday to the Ukrainians by the Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, two sources said. While his trip to Ukraine was previously scheduled, it was an opportunity to share the current thinking on the revived push to end the war, the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian presidential office did not outright reject the current US efforts, saying Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, who becomes the primary Trump administration point person for the Ukrainians as the administration pushes – again – for a peace deal remains unclear. Throughout the last year, Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, has served as the chief Trump administration official communicating with the Ukrainians. But in recent months he has privately told people that he plans to depart early next year, which could leave a significant void until that role is filled.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/trump-cabinet-kristi-noem-chris-wright","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump officials prepare for potential cabinet shakeup after one-year mark","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As President Donald Trump marks his first year in office, White House officials are preparing for potential cabinet changes, especially in the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy.

  6:00 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The White House is preparing for possible turnover in the Cabinet after President Donald Trump reaches the one-year mark of his term, potentially shaking up his otherwise stable team of secretaries, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s cadre of secretaries, administrators and directors that form the official Cabinet has so far been relatively steady — by design, as officials close to the president aimed to avoid the imagery of Trump’s  turnover-filled  first term in office. But that could change as he completes his first year back in office in January.\n \n\n   \n  At least one of the federal agencies that could see change is the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency helmed by Kristi Noem that is charged with executing Trump’s campaign  promise of mass deportation . Sources also said there could be turnover in the Department of Energy, currently run by  Chris Wright , a former Colorado fracking executive whose relationship with the White House has frayed in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  While there are ongoing discussions, officials stressed that no decisions have been made, and the Cabinet is expected to remain the same at least through the start of next year.\n \n\n   \n  “The cabinet is not changing no matter how much CNN wishes that it would because it thrives off drama,” said White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.\n \n\n   \n    Friction at Homeland Security\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself is happy with Noem, multiple sources told CNN, and he has consistently praised her in public and private settings. But behind the scenes, some top White House officials have become frustrated with chief adviser Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Noem confidante who was tapped early on to serve at DHS as a special government employee — a temporary status.\n \n\n   \n  “The President loves Kristi. He loves the job she’s doing,” one senior White House official told CNN, pushing back on the notion that the former South Dakota governor was on the chopping block.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s history with Noem, dating back to when she was governor, and their dual leadership of the department has prompted questions about whether the two would leave together, therefore opening the head position at DHS.\n \n\n   \n  A familiar face in Trump’s orbit who helped run his 2016 campaign, Lewandowski has become ensconced at DHS and is often at Noem’s side. The enormous power he’s amassed has also put him in the crosshairs of some senior White House officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, he likes [Noem], but it has been brought to his attention that [Lewandowski] is a problem, and the agency is being mismanaged because of it,” a person close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  At DHS, Lewandowski has  directed the firings of personnel , requested employees be put on administrative leave, called agency leaders “to hold them accountable,” and been described as a micro-manager — including for the massive infusion of cash the department has received to ramp up deportations. Multiple sources told CNN Lewandowski has developed a reputation at the department of reprimanding officials who he views as slowing down the administration’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  “The tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security – a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens – at President Trump’s direction and under Secretary Noem’s leadership, speak for themselves,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  And a DHS spokesperson said in response to CNN’s questions: “Mr. Lewandowski certainly has reputation of reprimanding officials who impede or slow down the administration and undermine the will of the American people—the American people voted for Donald J. Trump, not a bureaucrat.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, Trump convened a meeting with Lewandowski and Noem over the management of DHS, according to two people familiar with the event. One person said the Oval Office sit-down grew contentious, particularly between Lewandowski and Trump, who left the meeting irritated with Lewandowski. The tense meeting was notable to some inside the White House who believe that Lewandowski has only survived because of his strong relationship with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski’s relationship with many in Trump’s inner circle, including Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, is strained after the 2024 campaign, according to multiple people in and around the White House. Lewandowski was brought on to work for then-campaign co-chairs Wiles and Chris LaCivita just months before Election Day, with the candidate telling his former campaign manager he missed the old days of his first run for the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The dynamic quickly devolved into a power struggle, with Wiles and LaCivita irked by Lewandowski’s efforts to constantly assert himself in high-level decisions, often taking his opinions directly to Trump, people familiar with the discussions told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Lewandowski  was sidelined  before the campaign ended, and he didn’t score a top position in the West Wing. Instead, he ended up at Homeland Security with a  temporary job status  that is supposed to last for only 130 workdays in a yearlong period. Though Lewandowski began working for DHS soon after Trump returned to office, the spokesperson said he still had 40 days remaining.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the current relationship, a White House official noted that Wiles had a meeting with Noem and Lewandowski regarding FEMA this week.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, DHS often caught the ire of the president over not doing enough to clamp down on immigration. Over the course of that term, the department had five secretaries, three of whom served in acting capacities.\n \n\n   \n    Other Cabinet questions\n \n\n   \n  Wright has also found himself on the outs with the White House recently, people familiar with the dynamics told CNN, prompting speculation his job atop the Energy Department might be in a precarious position. The people familiar said that some White House officials have privately complained that Wright was slow-walking some initiatives that Trump promised during his campaign and that he has contributed to high turnover in some of the agency’s top jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Wright has been working lockstep with President Trump since day one to restore America’s energy dominance and safeguard our economic and national security,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. “Thanks to the Trump Administration’s historic efforts to ‘DRILL, BABY, DRILL’, oil production hit an all-time record high in July while prices at the pump have fallen to the lowest in years.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Energy Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t the first time that a Cabinet secretary has appeared to be on thin ice in Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the possible replacement of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was  discussed at length  after the revelation that he had accidentally shared sensitive information on a Signal chain to which a reporter had been added. Over the summer, Trump  grew annoyed  with Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, over her stance on Iran’s nuclear capability.\n \n\n   \n  Both Hegseth and Gabbard have remained in their jobs, but pressure to replace Hegseth could resurface in the coming weeks as the Pentagon’s internal watchdog is expected to release its report on the Signal incident, which — while not carrying any formal sanction for the Defense Secretary — could return the issue to the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n    Youngkin in the wings?\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited out of office in January, is among the Republican leaders expected to be under consideration for any potential openings in the Cabinet or administration. While the president has praised Youngkin, several Republicans close to Trump say, the two men have not had a direct conversation about any prospective role.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin, who turns 59 next month, saw his endorsed successor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears,  defeated in a landslide  on Nov. 4 in an embarrassing loss for the governor and his fellow Republicans in the state.\n \n\n   \n  In a call with supporters before that election, Youngkin showered Trump with praise.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I want to thank you,” Youngkin said. “You’ve cut trade deals, peace deals, you’ve brought huge investments back to the United States. I know that you will always put America first.”\n \n\n   \n  The president responded in kind, calling Youngkin “one of the great governors in our country.” Trump added, “We’re very proud of you and the job you’ve done.”\n \n\n   \n  The governor has told allies that he would be excited by the prospect of joining the Cabinet, should a vacancy arise, but he has expressed more interest in an economic or business portfolio, rather than one focused on immigration. One longtime friend, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Youngkin would likely be reluctant to assume the reins of Trump’s aggressive deportation policies at the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been made clear that [Youngkin] is interested in working for the administration in some capacity,” one senior White House official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Youngkin did not respond to a request for comment about the governor’s plans when he leaves office in January.\n \n\n   \n  Youngkin is weighing his political future, allies say, even though he is uncertain whether he could find a suitable opening to match his ambitions. He made summer trips to Iowa and South Carolina, two key stops in any Republican presidential primary, to meet party activists and keep his options open.\n \n\n   \n  Some Cabinet turnover is expected in any administration. During former President Joe Biden’s administration, the departments of Housing and Urban Development as well as Labor saw changes at the top, but neither vacancy occurred in the first two years.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/sport/football-ncaa-harvard-yale-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"The Nerd's Will Finally Go to the College Football Playoffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Harvard-Yale college football rivalry, one of the oldest in the nation dating back to 1875, is set to have its first postseason appearance in over a century.

football playoffs \n       \n  Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s a  football  rivalry so old that it’s merely referred to as “The Game.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been going on for 150 years, which is longer than football powerhouses such as Alabama, Georgia and Notre Dame have even been playing the sport.\n \n\n   \n  And yet, the last (and only) time either of these rivals appeared in a postseason football game was during Woodrow Wilson’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  All that will come to an end this year: The winner of Saturday’s  Harvard - Yale  game will be going to the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  Turns out that arguably the eight most powerful schools in the country that make up the Ivy League – including Harvard and Yale – had been banning themselves from postseason play since World War II.\n \n\n   \n  One big reason is that these schools didn’t want to take part in the increasing commercialization of the  college football  game – which is now in overdrive.\n \n\n   \n  The self-imposed ban came to an end this past offseason. The culprit? The students. Students from these schools pushed for, and convinced, the league to allow them to take part in playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, we’re not talking about the same playoffs that involve the aforementioned Alabamas, Georgias, Ohio States and Notre Dames of the world, though that would certainly be interesting to see.\n \n\n   \n  The Harvard-Yale winner will join the playoffs for the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), which is a notch below the Football Bowl Subdivision containing college football’s most recognizable powerhouses.\n \n\n   \n  That might make it easy to dismiss this matchup, but the history and strength of these teams suggests otherwise.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, I say this as a Dartmouth man who roots for Columbia football.\n \n\n   \n  Harvard-Yale is the second oldest college football rivalry, only beaten by Princeton and Yale. When they first met in 1875, it was one of the first times football was played under any real semblance of modern day rules.\n \n\n   \n  The football that we know today is popular because of teams like these. Yale still has won more college football titles than any other team, leading Alabama by two. Harvard is still eighth on the all-time list! Harvard, Yale and the rest of the Ivy League were forced out of  college football’s top division at the beginning of the 1980s. \n \n\n   \n  The great history of these programs shouldn’t detract from modern day interest. It remains high. The average attendance of Harvard-Yale games at the Yale Bowl is about 50,000. That’s more than any  Major League Baseball  team’s average attendance.\n \n\n   \n  The game also has a cultural cachet that few other games have: It helps kick start one of the  greatest Simpsons’ episodes  of all time, “Burns, Baby Burns,” where Mr. Burns finds out he has a son named Larry – voiced by legendary comedian Rodney Dangerfield.\n \n\n   \n  But in all seriousness, the game will likely be a good one.\n \n\n   \n  Harvard ranks 10th in the FCS out of 129 teams. They haven’t lost a game. They are seventh in scoring offense and third in scoring defense. They have won their games on average by more than 25 points.\n \n\n   \n  Yale comes into the game ranked 25th in the FCS. They’ve lost just one game thanks to a defense that ranks sixth in points allowed. They’ve won their average game by double-digits.\n \n\n   \n  History dictates too that the game should be good: The last five meetings between the two squads have been determined by a touchdown or less.\n \n\n   \n  This game, however, has more on the line than any of those.\n \n\n   \n  The victor will win the Ivy League and automatically be going to the playoffs. The loser will have to hope for an at-large bid.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-05:00","title":"Rescuers continue to recover bodies from rubble, days after deadly Russian attack on western Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late November 2025, a large-scale Russian airstrike on apartment buildings in Ternopil, western Ukraine, killed at least 31 people, including several children.

days after deadly Russian attack on western Ukraine \n       \n  By Victoria Butenko, Kosta Gak, Todd Symons and Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:46 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescuers were still working through the rubble on Friday, uncovering more bodies after a Russian attack hit apartment buildings in western Ukraine earlier this week, killing at least 31 people including several children, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s emergency service said Thursday that people were still missing after the airstrikes on two apartment blocks in the western city of Ternopil. On Friday, three more bodies were recovered, including those of two children. Ukraine’s interior minister said the strikes may have wiped out entire families.\n \n\n   \n  The large-scale Russian attack overnight Tuesday was one of the deadliest to target western Ukraine since the start of the conflict and prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets over neighboring Poland and Romania.\n \n\n   \n  Russia “will never stop on its own,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram, urging allies to increase pressure on Moscow to halt the violence and restore peace.\n \n\n   \n  Oksana Kobel’s son was in a ninth-story apartment in the building at the time of the attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to work, heard the explosions. I called him and said, ‘Bohdan, go to the shelter, get dressed.’ He answered, ‘Mom, I am already up. Everything will be fine,’” she said   Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s attacks have mostly targeted the eastern part of the country and large cities such as Kyiv, and many Ukrainians have fled to the west.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles during the attack. The buildings in Ternopil were most likely hit by Russia’s powerful Kh-101 cruise missile, which is designed to avoid air defenses and is equipped with an advanced precision guiding system, they said.   \n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Defense Ministry said it scrambled two Eurofighters, part of NATO’s fleet, and later two Romanian F-16 fighter jets after a  Russian drone entered its airspace  during the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Polish and allied fighter jets were also launched to protect Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, the country’s  operational command  said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation were in Ukraine on Thursday for meetings with officials following reports that Russia and the US were working on peace proposals that call for Ukraine to cede land and reduce the size of its army.\n \n\n   \n  Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski told CNN that any peace plan would have to involve Europe and leave Ukraine with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Poland is a neighbor of both Russia and Ukraine, and the (European Union) is helping Ukraine more, including militarily, than the US, and also financially more than the US. So we have a much bigger stake in this than the US,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  NATO allies have  increasingly scrambled fighter jets  in recent months during Russian attacks on Ukraine, or when stray Russian munitions, drones and warplanes have either strayed too close to their borders or crossed them.\n \n\n   \n  The latest move by NATO comes during a tense week. Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Poland’s Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed regret over the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the US State Department approved a possible $105 million sale that would allow Ukraine to upgrade its Patriot air defense system – a critical shield against Russian aerial attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s ability to meet current and future threats by further equipping it to conduct self-defense and regional security missions with a more robust local sustainment capability,” said a Pentagon statement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Zelensky struck a deal during a visit to Paris to purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/sport/football-nfl-kickoffs-chiefs-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:57:00-05:00","title":"President Trump ‘doesn’t even know what he’s looking at’ on NFL kickoffs, says Chiefs assistant","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump criticized the NFL's dynamic kickoff rule, claiming it is unsafe and undermines the game's pageantry, despite the league's assertion that it improves safety and increases excitement.

recognize only ‘male’ or ‘female’ patients \n       \n  By Rachana Pradhan, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.\n \n\n   \n  The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute  will categorize cancer patients  as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.\n \n\n   \n  Registries  currently specify  whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump in January issued an  executive order  stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.\n \n\n   \n  “In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.\n \n\n   \n    Missing the big picture\n \n\n   \n  Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.\n \n\n   \n  “When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”\n \n\n   \n  For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents  97% of the U.S. population . The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering  nearly half  the U.S. population.\n \n\n   \n  The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.\n \n\n   \n  For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying  rising rates of colorectal cancer  among people  younger than 50 . As a result, U.S. guidelines  now recommend  that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.\n \n\n   \n  States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women.  The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas  initiated a statewide effort  aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”\n \n\n   \n  The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.\n \n\n   \n  For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.\n \n\n   \n  The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Backwards’ progress\n \n\n   \n  NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.\n \n\n   \n  According to an  analysis of CDC data  by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.\n \n\n   \n  “Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.\n \n\n   \n  A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were  two to three times  as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.\n \n\n   \n  A  Canadian study  concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a  2023 study  from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.\n \n\n   \n  Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.\n \n\n   \n  Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and  stopping specialized services  for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.\n \n\n   \n  Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”\n \n\n   \n   KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at  KFF  — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/marimar-martinez-shooting-case-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:07:00-05:00","title":"Text messages and a moved SUV: How the government’s case against a Chicago woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apart","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marimar Martinez, a U.S. citizen, was accused of aggressively pursuing and ramming a Customs and Border Protection agent, Charles Exum, in Chicago on October 4, 2025, after which Exum fired multiple shots.

Bill Kirkos, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:07 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A wide grin was plastered on Marimar Martinez’s face Thursday as she thanked her attorneys outside an Illinois courtroom and told reporters, “I’m just blessed. I’m happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been hard,” she said. “I can’t sleep, but now I’m gonna go sleep.”\n \n\n   \n  A judge – after an  extraordinary request from federal prosecutors  – had just dismissed the charges against Martinez, a United States citizen who was accused of ramming a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago before he shot her several times.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling from US District Judge Georgia Alexakis came after she had repeatedly raised concerns about the handling of the investigation, which saw a revelation that a vehicle that may have been critical to the case was moved  1,000 miles away  and text messages showing the border patrol agent  apparently bragging  about the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been  accused  of “aggressively and erratically” pursuing CBP agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city. The charging complaint says Exum then stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez – shots the Department of Homeland Security called “defensive.” Martinez had pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the courtroom, the judge noted the government’s case included omissions  that caused her to tread carefully  as Martinez’s defense attorney alleged that it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Outside the courtroom, the high-profile case garnered public scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  “These agents were lying about what happened,” Martinez’s attorney Christopher Parente said Thursday. “Miss Martinez never rammed anybody.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a striking reversal by the US government when prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charges Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The US Attorney’s Office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz,” spokesperson Joseph Fitzpatrick said.\n \n\n   \n  Legal experts told CNN the move was likely the result of a series of questionable claims from the federal government in court and a calculation over whether it can be proven at trial that the gunshots were justified.\n \n\n   \n  “There have been serious questions raised about the truthfulness of the statements made by the Border Patrol agent who shot Ms. Martinez and …about the extent to which she could get a fair trial when the Department of Homeland Security was using her case to make inflammatory public claims about the level of resistance to  Operation Midway Blitz ,” Northwestern law professor Paul Gowder told CNN. “Dismissing the case was the right thing to do with that kind of cloud over it.”\n \n\n   \n  Criminal defense attorney and CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said the prosecutors’ move to dismiss the case is “highly unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers’ narratives,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  If the case had moved forward, it likely   would have been unsuccessful, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the investigation and how experts say the government’s case fell apart:\n \n\n   \n    Apparent bragging text messages provide insight\n \n\n   \n  Text messages displayed in court earlier this month were likely key in the prosecution’s decision to move to dismiss charges, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Exum appeared to brag to fellow agents about his marksmanship after he repeatedly shot Martinez following a collision between their vehicles, the text messages revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Boasting about the shots would look bad to a jury, Jackson said. Had the case moved forward, the government would have needed to justify every shot he took and prove that there was immediate danger and proportionate force.\n \n\n   \n  Exum sent an  article from The Guardian  on October 7 to a group of other agents, which quoted Parente saying Martinez had “seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum said in the next text.\n \n\n   \n  Parente pointed to the messages as an indication Exum understood the high public scrutiny of the case.\n \n\n   \n  When Parente pressed him on what he meant, Exum responded he was a firearms instructor. He said, “I take pride in my shooting skills.”\n \n\n   \n  Another message to the group read, “I have a MOF amendment to add to my story. I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge MOF is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one up someone wherever possible.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what exactly he was responding to because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Referencing the messages, Parente on Thursday said, “He’s going to pay for those shots, and he’s not going to be as proud and as arrogant as he was when he testified in this courthouse a few weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the texts “reflect poorly on the agent,” who would be a key witness at trial. Prosecutors also have to consider the equities or the fairness of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “Here you have a woman who was shot multiple times, and there were serious questions of whether she had done anything wrong whatsoever,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Key evidence was moved 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  Hearings in the case included discussion on what the government did with Exum’s car following the collision. The way that piece of key evidence was handled was one of the significant problems with the government’s case, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s defense attorney sought to prove his claim  the government potentially destroyed evidence  when it released Exum’s damaged vehicle and allowed the agent to drive it more than 1,000 miles to his home state of Maine, where the car may have had repairs.\n \n\n   \n  “That means that the government did not properly handle and maintain evidence. That’s a major problem in the presentation of the case,” Honig said. It needed to be preserved in the exact same condition that it was in after the collision, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said it was a major misstep for the federal government that undermined their credibility. In every other case he’s seen where a car was involved in a shooting, the car is taken to be analyzed by law enforcement and experts reconstruct the collision.\n \n\n   \n  “Any evaluation of the trajectory of the damage would go to show what happened. Instead, you take the car away and destroy evidence,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Alexakis expressed skepticism over why Martinez’s car had been kept in Chicago as evidence while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally.\n \n\n   \n  “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n  But Alexakis said the government clearly believed the vehicle could be exculpatory evidence; otherwise, it would not have gone through the trouble to preserve records on the car.\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis ordered the government last month to return the SUV to Chicago.\n \n\n   \n    Judge questioned government’s narrative\n \n\n   \n  Of more than two dozen people arrested for impeding or assaulting federal officers or other protest-related offenses amid demonstrations over the federal immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, none have gone to trial and charges have been dropped against at least nine of them, the  Associated Press  reported. Judges have expressed skepticism over the strength of some cases.\n \n\n   \n  In this instance, the judge’s apparent skepticism could have had an impact on prosecutors’ decision to request a dismissal, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Judges can absolutely signal to the government that they have questions and skepticism about a case, and prosecutors, if they pick up on that, that that could weigh in favor of dismissal,” Honig said.\n \n\n   \n  In court, Alexakis noted ﻿discrepancies in the government’s case have caused her “to question the narrative being put forward.”\n \n\n   \n  She pointed out the Justice Department had previously said in court the agent took the SUV back to Maine because it was his “personal vehicle,” then stated in a later court filing the car is part of an official Border Patrol fleet.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted she had not previously been told a mechanic had worked on the car, and also the government has given at least two different accounts of who approved the car’s removal to Maine.\n \n\n   \n  She acknowledged the government version of events may turn out to be true, “but I can’t accept that possibility at this juncture,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Thursday restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the DOJ for further comment.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson said the inconsistencies in the government’s narrative were a pivotal part of the dismissal. For their case to be successful, they would have had to establish that there is probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and that the defendant committed it.\n \n\n   \n  “The narratives of the agents were falling apart,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/mamdani-trump-white-house-meeting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"20:35:00-05:00","title":"Trump Set to Host Mamdani at the White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on November 21, 2025, marking a pivotal moment in political relations between the federal government and a major urban center.

Trump set to host Mamdani at the White House \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:35 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As he celebrated a decisive victory earlier this month, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani made a direct appeal to President Donald Trump: “Since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!”\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders will hear each other loud and clear when they come face-to-face at the White House on Friday for their first meeting, which the mayor-elect has said he requested.\n \n\n   \n  And while it will offer an opportunity to try to forge a working relationship between the federal government and the new leader of the country’s most populous city, political tensions loom large.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  She was repeating the president’s frequent line of attack during the campaign, when Trump urged voters in his native city to back Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, over the GOP nominee. (Mamdani  has said  he is not a communist despite the White House’s claims.) Trump had also threatened to halt the city’s federal funding if Mamdani won, and indicated openness to  seizing control  of the city – which could put the mayor-elect’s agenda at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s not about myself, it’s not about a relationship with an individual. It’s about a relationship between New York City and the White House,” Mamdani told reporters on Thursday previewing the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani spent much of Thursday preparing for the meeting, including by holding calls with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Rev. Al Sharpton to discuss how to approach it and how best to communicate with Trump, according to an aide to Mamdani’s transition team. He also spoke with Robert Wolf, the former CEO of UBS Americas and a known ally of former President Barack Obama, according to Wolf’s  post on social media .\n \n\n   \n  The face-to-face between the leader of the MAGA movement and the self-described democratic socialist comes after Mamdani secured a commanding victory — winning more than 50% of the vote — with a focus on working-class issues. His strong performance — coupled with Democratic gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia — has, in part, fueled Trump’s attacks on “affordability” as a Democratic “con job.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Thursday suggested affordability is at the top of his agenda for Friday’s discussions.\n \n\n   \n  “I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case. And I’ll make that case to anyone, frankly, as we’ve been doing over the course of the campaign, and now as I will be the next mayor of this city, it behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has  promised action  to make public buses free and reduce the cost of living, including by opening government-run grocery stores, freezing the rent for 1 million rent-stabilized tenants in the city, and a plan to create New York City’s first universal childcare program.\n \n\n   \n  According to CNN exit polling, 27% of voters in the mayoral election approved of Trump, compared to 70% who disapproved. And while a majority of voters in the overwhelmingly blue city — 58% — said that Trump was not a factor in their vote, 32% said they cast their ballots to express opposition to the president.\n \n\n   \n  There is, however, crossover in the Venn-Diagram of voters who supported both Trump in 2024 and Mamdani this year: 10% of Trump’s voters voted for Mamdani, according to CNN exit polling.\n \n\n   \n  The city, Leavitt said Thursday, is “becoming much more left than I think this president ever anticipated in his many years of living in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  But she cast the meeting as a reflection of Trump’s willingness to “meet with anyone and talk to anyone.” Asked whether the president could be persuaded to abandon his threat to cut federal funding to New York, she declined to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated that threat the day after the election, while offering a glimmer of collegiality. “I thought it was a very angry speech, certainly angry toward me. And I think he should be very nice to me. You know, I’m the one that sort of has to approve a lot of things coming to him, so he’s off to a bad start,” he told Fox News’ Bret Baier.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York. I really love New York,” the president added.\n \n\n   \n  But Mamdani also offers Trump — and his party — a political foil ahead of the 2026 midterms. The soon-to-be lame duck president, who has focused on rivals like former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, could make the mayor-to-be, who takes office January 1, his new boogeyman.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance, who may have his own higher political ambitions, has no interest in Friday’s get-together.\n \n\n   \n  “I might have a stomach bug,” he joked at a Thursday Breitbart News event.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s meeting with the president is taking place earlier than usual as he has not yet taken office. New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with Trump in the Oval Office in May 2025 and former Mayor Bill de Blasio met with him inside Trump Tower shortly after Trump was elected the first time in 2016. The meeting between Mamdani and Trump is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/medicare-premiums-rise-health-care","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:01:00-05:00","title":"Senior citizens will pay a lot more for Medicare in 2026","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senior citizens will face significantly higher Medicare premiums in 2026, with Medicare Part B rising by nearly 10% to $202.90—consumed from the $56 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.

  \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senior citizens are the latest group of Americans to face steep increases in their health insurance premiums for 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Part B premiums will jump nearly 10% next year, the largest increase in  four years  and second-largest hike, in dollar terms, in the program’s history. The standard monthly premium will be $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from this year, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That will eat up nearly one-third of the $56 monthly  Social Security cost-of-living adjustment  that retirees will receive in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  The steep increase in premiums for Medicare Part B — which covers doctors’ visits, outpatient hospital services, medical equipment and drugs administered by physicians, among other services — comes at a time when health insurance premiums are rising sharply for those with  job-based coverage  and  Affordable Care Act policies.  This upward trend puts more pressure on Americans already struggling with affordability as the prices of  food ,  utilities  and other necessities remain stubbornly high.\n \n\n   \n  “In a world in which people are concerned about the affordability of health care and all other needs, it’s pretty distressing that this increase is so large,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at The Century Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Increasing medical and pharmaceutical costs, as well as usage, are common drivers of the rise in health care premiums across coverage types.\n \n\n   \n  Medicare is also contending with the continuing wave of baby boomers becoming eligible to enroll, plus the ongoing shift toward surgeries and other medical services being performed at outpatient facilities, rather than in hospitals, where care is covered by Medicare Part A, said Rachel Schmidt, research professor at Georgetown University’s Medicare Policy Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  CMS noted that monthly premiums would have risen by another $11 had it not approved a change in payment for skin substitutes that the agency says will reduce spending by nearly 90% on the wound care products. Medicare shelled out more than $10 billion for these products last year, up from $256 million in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Medicare Part D prescription drug policies, which are offered by insurers, will see fewer changes for 2026 than they did for this year. The Biden administration had to rush last fall to stand up a  multibillion-dollar subsidy program  for insurers to prevent steep premium increases stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act. The law, which the Democrat-led Congress approved in 2022, required insurers to be on the hook for more of the drug costs once enrollees hit the catastrophic coverage phase above  a $2,000 cap .\n \n\n   \n  The number of plans being offered for 2026 will decrease modestly, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which noted that Elevance is exiting the market. Many insurers are hiking their premiums by as much as $50 for next year, though some are lowering them or holding them steady.\n \n\n   \n  “If seniors in the standalone PDP market are willing to shop, there is still stability,” said Brooks Conway, a principal at Oliver Wyman.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 69 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, which also covers people with disabilities. The annual open enrollment period ends December 7.\n \n\n   \n    Medicare Advantage market retrenches\n \n\n   \n  Medicare Advantage, which covers just over half of Medicare beneficiaries, is going through a second year of  major changes . The overhaul is being spurred by medical costs outpacing reimbursements from the federal government, which pays insurers to offer coverage to Medicare enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  Many enrollees will have to search for new coverage for 2026 since the number of offerings is tumbling 10% to 3,373 plans, according to Oliver Wyman. Major insurers, including CVS Aetna, Elevance, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, are reducing their plan options in at least 100 counties. The changes are expected to affect just over 2 million people.\n \n\n   \n  (These figures do not include special needs plans that cater to enrollees with chronic conditions or those who are dually eligible for Medicaid. These plans will have more offerings for 2026 than they did this year.)\n \n\n   \n  In certain counties, there will be fewer policies offered with $0 premiums and fewer PPO plans, which have wider provider networks, said Greg Berger, a partner at Oliver Wyman. Insurers are primarily seeking to exit or scale back their less profitable products and geographic areas.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of MAPD plans are trying not to grow,” Berger said, referring to Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage.\n \n\n   \n  And for the first time, some Americans will have no Medicare Advantage plans to choose from. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont and UnitedHealthcare decided to discontinue their coverage in the Green Mountain State, leaving traditional Medicare as the only option for residents in eight counties.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even with the pullbacks, most Medicare beneficiaries will have an array of options in 2026 — 39 plans, on average, down from 42 plans this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to a broad range of affordable coverage options in 2026,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, CMS’ administrator, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Also, fewer plans will offer $0 deductibles for prescription drugs, while maximum out-of-pocket limits for medical care are rising $490, or about 10%, on average. Among Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage that have a monthly premium, the average premium will increase to $66 next year, up from $60 this year.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the supplemental benefits that Medicare Advantage offers enrollees, such as funds for over-the-counter medicines, dental care and vision services, are getting skimpier. The dental allowance, for instance, is declining 10% to $2,107, on average, Berger said.\n \n\n   \n  The current disruptions in the market, however, don’t mean that Medicare Advantage will continue to shrink. Over the longer term, the program is still an attractive market for insurers, Schmidt said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not going away any time soon,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/discharge-petitions-congress-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"The success of the forced Epstein files vote is emboldening some Republicans to go it alone","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of a successful vote on the Jeffrey Epstein files, Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives are increasingly using discharge petitions — a procedural tool requiring 218 signatures — to bypass leadership and force votes on legislation.

Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson may want to put the Jeffrey Epstein saga behind him, but some Republicans saw rank-and-file members’ success in forcing Tuesday’s vote as an opportunity to push their own legislative priorities to the floor — even if it doesn’t have leadership’s blessing.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has put House Republican leaders on notice that unless they change their approach to a bipartisan bill banning lawmaker stock trading, she will circumvent them using a discharge petition and force a vote herself.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent interview in her office, the Florida Republican told CNN the overwhelming support from lawmakers to release the Jeffrey Epstein files should encourage more members to take advantage of the leadership-bucking tool that made the vote possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think more members need to use it,” Luna said. “More members need to get outside of this mentality that you have to go and ask for permission from leadership to bring legislation. That’s not why you’re here. And that defeats the purpose of why you call yourself a representative. If you want to be a follower, call yourself a follower of Congress, but not a representative of Congress if you’re not doing your job.”\n \n\n   \n  Typically, the majority party’s leadership team dictates floor activity, setting the calendar for which bills are brought and when.\n \n\n   \n  Discharge petitions face many procedural hurdles (to start, it requires 218 signatures — a majority of all 435 members, rather than a majority of members present) and rarely lead to an actual vote.\n \n\n   \n  It’s even more unusual for a member to deploy the tactic when their own party is in power. But in a fractured Washington with razor-thin margins in the House, there are signs lawmakers may consider the strategy more seriously.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Don Bacon recently signed onto a discharge petition to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers after President Donald Trump  signed  an executive order ending the practice. That petition just clinched the necessary 218 signatures needed to move forward toward a vote on the House floor. And this week, Bacon told CNN he is preparing to help launch another petition that would push for more aid to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I respect the speaker and the majority leader drive the agenda. But the discharge petition process enables us to push member-driven initiatives to the floor for a vote,” Bacon said.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who also signed onto the workers’ rights petition, said “it’s is certainly being viewed by members individuals as a tool in their disposal.” Still, he said, their use is “still very limited and it really depends on the issue.”\n \n\n   \n  This year alone, lawmakers have brought 10 discharge petitions, with the Epstein files push standing as the most notable. Last Congress, under Republican control, 20 discharge petitions were filed, after 18 the Congress before. By contrast in the 116th Congress, from 2019-2020, only 5 such attempts were made. Only a handful became law.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had long tried to block the Epstein discharge petition from coming to the floor and strongly criticized the use of the tool to force a vote, even though he ultimately supported the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Discharge petitions are never a good idea. In the House, it is a tool of the minority party, not the majority,” Johnson said in July.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Acknowledging Johnson’s argument, Luna said, “A discharge petition is simply a legislative tool where we actually can collect signatures to bring something to the floor. It’s kind of an old school way of legislating.”\n \n\n   \n  And the tool has helped her clinch legislative wins. The congresswoman’s threat of bringing a discharge petition helped her  reach an agreement  with Johnson in their standoff over proxy voting for new parents, an issue that had paralyzed the House.\n \n\n   \n  “I will protect the discharge petition with every bone in my body,” Luna told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    New push to ban stock trading\n \n\n   \n  Now, Luna is prepared to use the same strategy to ensure the bipartisan push to ban stock trading of lawmakers, their spouses and their dependent children becomes law as pressure has escalated for elected officials to weed out corruption and restore public trust in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long-traded stocks and seeking a ban has been a yearslong pursuit. But Luna says that she is running into new roadblocks that are clouding the process.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of taking up the bipartisan bill that has 95 cosponsors, Luna said she has been informed that leadership wants to pursue their own bill and that members would not be allowed to add their own amendments.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just not feeling that this has been an open and honest process,” Luna said. “And so, I will make that decision collectivity with the other members who signed on.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Luna said that House Speaker Mike Johnson has been understanding throughout this process, but she is giving leadership until Friday to address the issue with her.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, I understand that he also has to manage other people and there’s a lot of personalities,” Luna said of Johnson. “This is not a popular topic on the Hill. In fact, it’s made me very unpopular within the House of Representatives but very popular among the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Even with the Friday deadline, Luna says her discharge petition is ready to go.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s filed, so it means it’s baked, so I can call it up whenever. And that’s the element of surprise that we like to keep people on our toes. So it’s ready to go,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/americas/canadian-man-loses-legal-battle-to-keep-his-secret-million-dollar-stash","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:45:00-05:00","title":"Canadian man loses legal battle to keep his secret million-dollar stash","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marcel Breton, a Canadian man, lost a 16-year legal battle to retain over 1.2 million Canadian dollars he had hidden in unusual places on his property in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

16-year legal battle to get back more than 1.2 million Canadian dollars he had stored in bizarre locations around his home.\n \n\n   \n  On December 1, 2009, police visited Marcel Breton’s rural property on the outskirts of Thunder Bay, a city in northwest Ontario, looking for an illegal handgun,  according to court documents. \n \n\n   \n  There, they made an unusual discovery: 15,000 Canadian dollars’ worth of bills in the floor heating ducts of the living room, about 32,000 dollars stored in locations around the garage, and over 1.2 million worth of Canadian bills in a rubber tub buried in the ground under the garage.\n \n\n   \n  All up, the stash was worth 1.19 million US dollars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  Police also found a variety of drugs, including cocaine, marijuana and ecstasy, and told Canadian media at the time that they were “flabbergasted.”\n \n\n   \n  Breton was charged with various offences, including possession of the proceeds of crime, and was initially convicted. But in a retrial, he successfully argued the search of his property wasn’t lawful, and he was acquitted.\n \n\n   \n  But then came the matter of what to do with all of the money.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, an Ontario appeals court upheld a 2023 ruling that decided the lion’s share of the money should go to the government.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court noted the trial judge, Justice Bruce Fitzpatrick, remarked that it was “unusual for an average person to have such a large amount of money buried in tubs underneath their property.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge also noted that the most common type of bill found in the bundles was 20 Canadian dollars, which is the most common denomination associated with the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, Breton had not reported any income to the Canada Revenue Agency between 2001 and 2008, the documents said.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also did not buy Breton’s justifications for why he had so much cash – that he had won it in a lottery or casino, or had earned it from his vehicle repair business.\n \n\n   \n  The trial judge then ordered that most of the money be handed over to the government, a decision the appeals court affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Sanaa Ahmed, assistant professor of law at the University of Calgary, said the case is an example of “legalistic hair-splitting.”\n \n\n   \n  “Confronted with facts such as these, courts will often find ways to justify confiscating monies and thus ‘punishing’ the accused, even though they may have been acquitted otherwise,” she told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, as societies, we’re growing increasingly comfortable with breaking some rules to catch the so-called ‘bad guys,’” Ahmed added. “But we forget that we made those rules precisely to avoid subjective, normative judgements by those who found themselves in judicial office.”\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Gallant, professor of law at the University of Manitoba, said in this case, the onus is on Breton to prove the money was obtained legally, noting “cash is the currency of illegal drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “What legitimate source might underlie dollars stuffed in a barrel and buried?  Why bury it?  Each day, at the very least, you would even bank interest,” Gallant said.\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t all bad news for Breton. The appeals court upheld Fitzpatrick’s prior ruling that Breton gets to keep 15,000 Canadian dollars which was found inside the vents of the home, since the judge couldn’t rule out that that cash had been obtained lawfully. In today’s money, that’s worth just over $10,600.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/us/alabama-public-libraries-books-transgender-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:42:00.000Z","title":"Alabama Board Votes to Remove Books About Being Transgender from Public Library Youth Sections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Alabama Public Library Service Board of Directors voted to remove books discussing transgender identity, gender ideology, or multiple biological genders from youth and children’s sections of public libraries, relocating them to adult sections.

The books must be housed in the adult sections.\n \n\n   \n  Board Chairman John Wahl, who is also chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, called the action “a major step forward in putting parents back in control in what their children are exposed to.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to put Alabama families in charge. We want them to make the decision what is best for their families,” Wahl said.\n \n\n   \n  The state board vote came after a heated public hearing last month. Opponents on Thursday called it an attempt at censorship and the erasure of trans people.\n \n\n   \n  The decision affects more than 200 local libraries and will take effect in 2026 after a required publication period.\n \n\n   \n  The language is being added to existing rules that youth sections must be free of material that is “sexually explicit or other material deemed inappropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  The new language also includes a directive that “all material containing such content must be weeded out of the library’s collection or relocated to an adult section.”\n \n\n   \n  Mack Reynolds held a sign outside the building stating that “positive representation” is not the same as sexually explicit material. He noted that the vote was taking place on Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day that focuses on trans people who have lost their lives because of violence.\n \n\n   \n  Reynolds, who is transgender, said books are the best way for people to learn about people who are different from them.\n \n\n   \n  “What I hope is that other children can approach my daughter with curiosity and compassion. And if they don’t know, then there is so much more room for angst, fear and frustration,” Reynolds said.\n \n\n   \n  The scope of the new rule is not entirely clear. During a public hearing, some proponents had objected to books that teach children about pronouns or describe a child’s experience being transgender. It is less clear if any book with a transgender character would be removed.\n \n\n   \n  “Most of the people of Alabama have not asked for this latest library-fixated assault on the LGBTQ community because it’s their children and children of friends and relatives you’re attacking with this misguided proposal before you,” Jim Vickery told the board during a public comment period.\n \n\n   \n  Board member Amy Minton said most comments that they received during a public comment period were in favor of the change.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what the majority of people of Alabama want,” Minton said.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the proposal said parents who want their children to read the books can get them in other places, including the adult sections of libraries.\n \n\n   \n  Angie Hayden, a co-founder of Read Freely Alabama, said she is concerned the aim is to completely remove the books. She said state regulations do not allow the purchase of books aimed at children if state regulations also deem the book inappropriate for children.\n \n\n   \n  “So long term they are banning these books, slowly removing these books from your public library,” Hayden said.\n \n\n   \n  The board also tightened restrictions on youth library cards, stating that the “standard library card” for minors cannot access books in adult collections. Libraries can issue an all-access card only with the written permission of parents.\n \n\n   \n  Board members also had sharp disagreements over restoring funding to the Fairhope Public Library. The board had moved to withhold funding because of some titles in the teen section.\n \n\n   \n  Board members rejected a proposal to restore funding immediately. Wahl said he wanted to wait until they had reviewed Fairhope’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “John, are you becoming the censor-in-chief for Alabama?” board member Ronald A. Snider asked Wahl.\n \n\n   \n  Snider said the state board is acting like a “board of censorship” when they “second guess” the decisions of professional librarians and local library boards.\n \n\n   \n  “You can call it second-guessing or you can call it accountability,” Wahl replied.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/world/jd-vance-wife-india-religion-debate-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"04:39:00-05:00","title":"JD Vance Expresses Hope His Hindu Wife Will Become a Christian; Sparks Backlash in India","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Vice President JD Vance sparked international backlash by expressing hope that his Hindu wife, Usha Vance, might one day convert to Christianity, a comment seen as culturally insensitive and politically charged, especially among Indians and South Asian diaspora communities.

That’s ruffled feathers in India \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, Matthew Rehbein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:39 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When JD Vance told a stadium of thousands he hoped his wife would one day be moved “by the Christian gospel” the same way he was, he inadvertently stepped into a contentious dialogue in India and among the diaspora about religious freedom and, for some, evoked memories of the country’s complicated past with Christian proselytizing.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at an event last month with Turning Point USA at the University of Mississippi, Vance was asked by an audience member about Christianity and American patriotism.\n \n\n   \n  “Why are we making Christianity one of the major things that you have to have in common to be one of you guys? To show that I love America just as much as you do?” the audience member asked.\n \n\n   \n  In an assertive and lengthy response that began on immigration, Vance then discussed his interfaith marriage: “My wife did not grow up Christian. I think it’s fair to say she grew up in a Hindu family but not in a particularly religious family.”\n \n\n   \n  Raised in an evangelical family, Vance converted  to Catholicism in 2019.  His wife,  Usha Vance , who grew up in Southern California and is of Indian descent, was raised in a Hindu household.\n \n\n   \n  “Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church? I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,” Vance went on to say.\n \n\n   \n  As the debate around those comments began to swell online among some Indians and the Indian diaspora, Vance responded to a since-deleted comment  on X , writing that “like many people in an interfaith marriage,” he hopes his wife may see things as he does one day, but would continue to support her regardless.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on October 30 at the Turning Point USA event honoring his longtime friend and late conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, Vance explained that he and his wife were “agnostic or atheist” when they met.\n \n\n   \n  “We decided to raise our kids Christian,” the vice president said, adding that the couple’s 8-year-old son, Vivek, had his first communion a year ago –– a remark that drew thunderous applause.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance talked about navigating raising children in an interfaith marriage during an  interview  with Meghan McCain in June, noting she and her husband had several conversations about it during his conversion to Catholicism.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not Catholic and I’m not intending to convert or anything like that,” Usha Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that while their children attend Catholic school, “they can choose whether they want to be baptized Catholic.” They are also exposed to the Hindu faith and traditions through her family, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My grandmother is a particularly devout Hindu. She prays every day. She goes to the temple regularly. She’ll do her own pujas (prayer rituals).”\n \n\n   \n  During the event last month, the vice president said, “One of the most important Christian principles is that you respect free will … You figure this stuff out as a family, and you trust in God to have a plan, and you try to follow it as best as you can.”\n \n\n   \n  But, despite Vance’s invocation of free will, his remarks struck a nerve –– some described the vice president’s words as denigrating towards Hindus –– and broadly, South Asians –– at a time of rising hostilities towards immigrants in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ridiculous and absolutely wrong,” 25-year-old Kush Mehta of Mumbai told CNN of Vance’s comments expressing his hope his wife would convert. “I’m in favor of everyone having their own identity, their own values, and their own spiritual path. No one should be forced or pressured into any religion.”\n \n\n   \n  “Vance felt compelled to declare that his wife was indeed raised Hindu, but not that Hindu,” CNN affiliate CNN-News18 editor Shubhangi Sharma wrote in an  opinion column . “In a political climate so charged against Indian immigrants, this is not just personal. It’s political. It’s a presidential call to convert.”\n \n\n   \n  “When an elected leader treats his faith as the ultimate ideal for everyone, including his wife, it ceases to be personal,” Areena Arora, a journalist with  The Hindu , wrote in an opinion piece, noting at the time of his baptism six years ago, Vance told  The American Conservative : “My views on public policy and what the optimal state should look like are pretty aligned with Catholic social teaching.”\n \n\n   \n    A reminder of India’s colonial past\n \n\n   \n  For some, Vance’s comments were a reminder of India’s painful past, where the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century heralded Christian proselytization, prejudice and, at times, forced conversions - particularly under British colonial rule.\n \n\n   \n  “The belief that the Christian religion must shape public order is the same civilisational justification that fuelled Europe’s conquest of the world,” Arora, a journalist with The Hindu, wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the differences between how Hindus and Christians think of religion, and because of the colonial history of Christian evangelizing, many Hindus today still think of Christianity as a kind of undigestible ‘foreign faith,’” said Chad Bauman, a professor of religious studies at Butler University in Indiana whose research focuses on the interactions and conflicts between Hindus and Christians.\n \n\n   \n  “This view is particularly common among the supporters of the party currently in charge,” Bauman added, referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its brand of Hindu Nationalism.\n \n\n   \n  India has seen recurring ethnic and religious clashes for centuries – but tensions have surged in recent decades amid a rise in violence against the Christian and Muslim minorities and, most notably, since the BJP came to power in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  India’s constitution guarantees freedom of religion, although some critics argue that religious freedoms have been eroded under the BJP at the expense of non-Hindu minorities. The issue of changing religion remains deeply controversial, and multiple states have put in place laws restricting religious conversions for all faiths.\n \n\n   \n  Bauman said Vance’s remarks also confirmed a common stereotype many Hindus have of religion in Trump’s America: “America is not a nation of religious tolerance and pluralism but rather one that privileges Christianity over all other religions.”\n \n\n   \n  Several social media users described Vance’s comments as contrary to American values.\n \n\n   \n  One  X  user criticized Vance for what they viewed as him casting Usha’s Hindu faith as a “problem to be fixed,” writing: “This isn’t American values; it’s weak leadership & poor politics, bending to MAGA pressure, not defending her dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  Another user wrote on  X : “When JD Vance had hit his lowest, it was his ‘Hindu’ wife and her Hindu upbringing that had helped him navigate through the tough times. Today in a position of power, her religion has become a liability. What a fall.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘She has to stick to her roots’\n \n\n   \n  For some in India, Usha Vance’s position in the administration as a woman of Hindu faith has become a point of pride.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s amazing … to see someone with Indian roots and a Hindu background in such a visible, powerful space in the US. It shows how far the community has come and how diverse leadership is becoming,” said Mehta of Mumbai.\n \n\n   \n  If the second lady does convert, “It would create a lot of backlash from people who are very staunch in their beliefs,” said Vanessa Almeida, a business owner in Goa.\n \n\n   \n  “She has to stick to her roots as much as possible,” Almeida said. “That’s what the community has been hoping for.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the vice president and second lady’s offices.\n \n\n   \n  Vance was quick to defend himself on social media against backlash, writing in the  X post  that the criticism wreaked “of anti-Christian bigotry.”\n \n\n   \n  “She is not Christian and has no plans to convert,” Vance clarified, adding that Usha Vance encouraged him to “reengage” with his faith many years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “But like many people in an interfaith marriage –– or any interfaith relationship –– I hope she may one day see things as I do,” he goes on to say. “Regardless, I’ll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she’s my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is completely in contrast to Vance’s previous comments that his wife’s Hindu upbringing and values inspired his own return to faith,” Priyanka Deo, US correspondent of Indian network NDTV, said on  Instagram , adding that his latest remarks suggest acceptance in the United States is conditional and predicated upon becoming a Christian.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, who converted to Catholicism while already married, has said his wife encouraged him to explore his faith and that his family influenced him in the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember when I started to reengage with my own faith, Usha was very supportive,” Vance said during an interview with  Fox News  in June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  During the same interview, Usha Vance said she supported her husband’s decision for a few reasons, including seeing the power of her parents’ faith. “That was one of the things that made them such good parents. That made them, really, very good people.”\n \n\n   \n  “I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Wooing the Republican base?\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s comments come ahead of the 2028 election. Trump, in August, suggested Vance was “most likely” the heir apparent to the  Make America Great Again movement  –– the furthest he’s gone in backing Vance as a future presidential candidate.\n \n\n   \n  Vance also told Fox News recently he plans to talk to Trump about potentially running after the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Ram Puniyani, a Mumbai-based writer and critic of Hindu fundamentalism, said he thinks Vance’s comments trample on freedom of religion –– an essential tenant of any democratic society, be it the United States or India, which is still widely regarded as the world’s largest democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that America’s civic society had much more liberal attitudes earlier, but those attitudes are getting rigid, and this is not a healthy thing for the growth of democracy worldwide,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Usha Vance has not spoken out about her husband’s comments, though some have jumped quickly to her defense.\n \n\n   \n  “No one has been harsher on JD Vance’s policy than I have,” wrote California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who is also Hindu,  on X.  “But his wife is an accomplished daughter of immigrants, and they have young kids. Attack on the policies. Leave his family out of it.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to others who have called Usha Vance a threat to the “MAGA base,” McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, said the second lady was a “huge asset” to the Republican party, someone who bridged party and political lines and “brought warmth” to the vice president.\n \n\n   \n  “She is among other things a modern mother and a style icon,”  McCain wrote on X . “She’s personally my favorite person in the Trump administration.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/weather/texas-flash-flood-hill-country-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"Flood threat for soaked Dallas and Texas Hill Country persists overnight as storms keep firing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Severe flooding continues in the Texas Hill Country due to repeated storms that have delivered over 9 inches of rain, prompting a flash flood emergency for nearly 1,300 people in parts of Concho, McCulloch, and Menard counties.

Texas Hill Country as storms crawl across the South. Parts of the region are still recovering from devastating flooding that  killed more than 130 people  this July.\n \n\n   \n  Over 9 inches of rain has fallen since Thursday morning in parts of western Hill Country, prompting a flash flood emergency – the highest level of flood alert   – for nearly 1,300 people in southeastern Concho, western McCulloch and central Menard counties Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The significant rainfall led authorities to issue precautionary evacuations at local RV parks and area campsites, county judge Brandon Corbin said in a statement Thursday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The flash flood emergency has been downgraded to a regular flood warning Thursday evening, but officials are not letting down their guard. Western Hill Country could pick up another inch or less of rain before the night is through.\n \n\n   \n  Several flash flood warnings have been issued Thursday in the region, where a Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place. The rest of central and northern Texas could also see localized flooding Thursday, including Dallas-Fort Worth. And a second round of downpours could pile onto the state’s flood worries beginning Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Storms were “training” over Hill Country, or lining up and moving over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track. The storms will begin to move east away from the soaked region this evening, ending the threat of additional heavy rainfall.\n \n\n   \n  The Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms.\n \n\n   \n  Farther north, storms in Dallas-Fort Worth triggered flash flood warnings Thursday morning. Several roads were closed because of flooding in the north Dallas area, according to the National Weather Service. Between 2 to 4 inches of rain had fallen. Additional rounds of rain through the early evening could bring another 1 to 4 inches.\n \n\n   \n  Flood watches extend along much of the Interstate 35 corridor from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to Austin into early Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  After drying out Friday and Saturday, a second soaking storm is expected to arrive in Texas as the weekend comes to an end. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall has been issued by the Weather Prediction Center for northern and central parts of Texas from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re in the Hill Country and other parts of Texas, keep phones charged and alerts on and avoid driving through flooded roads.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/narrow-house-majority-congress-dg","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Speaker Johnson’s narrow majority gets a bit more breathing room after Sherrill’s resignation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has gained a bit more breathing room in his narrow majority after Democratic Rep.

breathing room after Sherrill’s resignation \n       \n  By Clare Foran, Annette Choi and Ethan Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has bit more room in his narrow House majority after Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill resigned to take office as New Jersey governor.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s resignation, two weeks after her election victory and two months before she takes office, will still leave Johnson needing the near-unanimous support of his party to advance legislation.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House is now 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats, with three seats vacant. Johnson can only lose two Republicans on any party-line vote, but has a bit more room for absences in his party.\n \n\n   \n  The next vacant seat to be filled will be in a Republican-leaning district in Tennessee, where a special election is scheduled for early next month. Then, at the end of January, two Texas Democrats will meet in a runoff to fill another vacancy. The special election for Sherrill’s seat is expected to take place early next year.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump’s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans won 220 House seats  in the November elections,   while Democrats won 215,  the  most narrowly divided House  majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida  opted not to return to Congress. \n \n\n   \n  Passing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\n \n\n   \n    How the House majority ranks in history\n \n\n   \n  The last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\n \n\n   \n  The 72nd Congress — which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era — officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\n \n\n   \n  At the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further — to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\n \n\n   \n  In an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown  changed significantly  by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\n \n\n   \n  According to  House historical records , the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results,  which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214 . As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\n \n\n   \n    Challenges created by a narrow majority\n \n\n   \n  Johnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\n \n\n   \n  The partisan breakdown in the House has shifted several times since then as a result of vacancies that have arisen due to lawmaker deaths and resignations.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has at times had a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation – most notably Trump’s  massive tax and spending cuts package  in July – but not without challenges uniting their conference.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage of the tax and spending cuts bill in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/lawsuit-diddy-assault-jonathan-hay","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:07:00-11:07","title":"Jonathan Hay's Allegations Push New Investigation Into Diddy's Alleged Sexual Misconduct","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Hay, a music producer and publicist, has come forward with allegations of sexual battery against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, claiming incidents occurred in 2020 and 2021 during a music tribute project honoring The Notorious B.I.G.’s son, CJ Wallace.

After speaking with the attorney’s office, Hay got cold feet, fearful of standing up against a figure as powerful as Combs. He was, he said, “terrified.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reviewed email correspondence showing Hay reached out to the civil attorney’s office in March 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “I was like, I can’t do this,” Hay said of his first attempt to come forward with his claims against Combs in early 2023. “I’m just not ready.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay finally filed his claims against Combs – then as a “John Doe” – in July 2025, shortly after Combs was convicted by a New York jury on two federal prostitution-related counts that would lead to him being sentenced to more than four years.\n \n\n   \n  Once Ventura filed her lawsuit and dozens of other civil accusers came forward with lawsuits, he felt encouraged to tell his story. Hay said that he’d never considered that there could have been others who had allegedly been abused by Combs.\n \n\n   \n  Combs denies all accusations against him.  Roughly 70 accusers  have brought civil lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  “Once Cassie’s lawsuit came out,” Hay said, “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go. And then once the raids happened, I was like holy crap. That’s when I was like, ‘Okay, now is my time. Finally, I just decided that, alright, I’m going to go forward with this.”\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted someone to listen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Hay’s claims are at the center of a new investigation, launched this week by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Department confirmed that their Special Victims Bureau is investigating Hay’s claims after receiving a copy of his police report, first documented in September 2025 by police in Largo, Florida, where Hay resides.\n \n\n   \n  In the police report, Hay says he suffered from sexual battery by Combs in 2020, and then again in 2021, when he was working on a remix of Christopher “The Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace’s music as a tribute project, honoring one of Combs’ closest collaborators. Hay worked on the new music with the rapper’s son, CJ Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  In the 2020 incident, Hay said he was working at a photoshoot when he found himself in the same room as Combs, who began to masturbate into one of Biggie’s shirts. The police report details that Combs “removed the shirt to uncover his penis and told Hay to come finish him off.” The report states that Hay told police he was in shock and “stated that Combs then finished himself off and ejaculated on one of Notorious B.I.G. shirts” and then threw the shirt on Hay, “simultaneously saying, ‘Rest in peace BIG.’”\n \n\n   \n  In 2021, Hay told police that Combs forced him to perform oral sex on him, which he said made him feel suicidal.\n \n\n   \n  Hay said that a detective from the LASD’s Special Victims Bureau contacted him on Tuesday this week to notify him that she had been assigned to his case.\n \n\n   \n  Hay is cooperating with authorities, hopeful that their active investigation may lead to further criminal charges.\n \n\n   \n  “Biggie was like his supposedly his best friend,” he said. “To just do that in a shirt and to attack me like he had?” Hay said. “He doesn’t need to be out on the streets.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality’\n \n\n   \n  Hay’s allegations first became public this July when he filed his lawsuit anonymously against both Combs and Wallace.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace is named as a defendant with Hay claiming that he and others “conspired” with Combs to “allow or assist in Combs’ ability to carry out” his actions against Hay.\n \n\n   \n  Wallace has filed a defamation suit against Hay. In it, he claims that Hay falsified these accusations because he was “irate” that Biggie’s estate decided not to release the majority of the songs produced back in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “Jonathan Hay’s allegations against CJ Wallace will be shown to be a complete fantasy, totally devoid of reality,” Jeremiah Reynolds, an attorney for Wallace, told CNN. “We look forward to Hay eventually being held liable in court for defamation.”\n \n\n   \n  “CJ knows what happened,” Hay said. “He was there.

Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone,” Jonathan Davis, a civil attorney for Combs, said in a statement. “He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided – and not in the media – based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hay said he is not surprised that Combs continues to deny his allegations, and he remains focused on pursuing justice through his case.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that when he gets out of jail,” Hay said, “that he is taken straight to jail in California, or to go through the court proceedings in California, and that he spends the rest of his life in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  After a two-month federal trial in New York earlier this year, Combs is currently serving his four-plus year sentence at Fort Dix federal prison in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to respect the jurors and the decision that they made,” Hay said of the conviction, which Combs is currently appealing. “At least he got some time.

reduction \n       \n  By Jennifer Hansler, Kevin Liptak, Natasha Bertrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:06 AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A new  Trump administration plan  for the end of the war in Ukraine would see Kyiv cede territory to Russia, US “de facto” recognition of Crimea and other Ukrainian territory forcibly seized by the Kremlin as Russian, and limits to the size of Ukraine’s military, according to a draft of the plan obtained Thursday by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The draft’s veracity was confirmed to CNN by a US official. Many of the ideas put forward in the 28-point plan have been rejected in previous negotiations by Ukraine and European officials and would be seen as concessions to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  US officials said the plan was still being worked on, and that any final agreement would require concessions from both sides, not just Ukraine. Some of the points being circulated now – including some that appear weighted toward Moscow’s demands – are not final, officials said, and will almost certainly evolve. During a Thursday afternoon briefing, the White House press secretary said the plan remained “in flux.”\n \n\n   \n  After meeting a top US military official in Kyiv on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to work with the Trump administration on the new plan, saying in a social media post that he was prepared for “constructive, honest and swift work” to achieve peace.\n \n\n   \n  However, Moscow had not yet been informed that Zelensky was ready to discuss the plan,   a Russian journalist cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying, state media reported Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-point plan, which President Donald Trump has reviewed and supports, is the White House’s latest attempt to bring  Russia’s war in Ukraine  to an end. Some of the proposal’s provisions – including territorial concessions in areas not currently held by Russia – have previously been nonstarters with the Ukrainians. But US officials see a new window of opportunity to restart peace discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The plan is still in the framework stage, and its many points haven’t been finalized.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the draft plan\n \n\n   \n  Similar to the ceasefire in Gaza, the draft describes the plan’s implementation as being “monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J. Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  “Sanctions will be imposed for violations,” it states.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan would have Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk be recognized “as de facto Russian, including by the United States.” This would mark a stunning reversal of longstanding US policy to acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity and not recognize forcible changes in territory.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan says Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact, “which will mean de facto recognition along the line of contact.”\n \n\n   \n  “Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside the five regions,” it says.\n \n\n   \n  The plan calls for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the parts of Donetsk that they currently control, “and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan states that Russian forces will not enter the demilitarized zone. The two countries would commit not to change the agreed-upon territorial arrangements by force, or else security guarantees would not apply.\n \n\n   \n  The security guarantees, which the plan says Ukraine will receive, are not detailed in the draft. However, it notes that the US will receive compensation for its guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  If Russia invades Ukraine, “in addition to a decisive coordinated military response, all global sanctions will be reinstated, recognition of the new territory and all other benefits of this deal will be revoked,” the draft states.\n \n\n   \n  “If Ukraine launches a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg without cause, the security guarantee will be deemed invalid,” it notes.\n \n\n   \n  The draft plan includes a commitment that Ukraine will not join NATO, that NATO will not station troops in Ukraine, and that European fighter jets be stationed in Poland.\n \n\n   \n  It limits the size of the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 personnel. It also calls for Ukrainian elections within 100 days.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the creation of a joint US-Russia “working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  It outlines a return of Russia into the global community, including the lifting of sanctions, invitation to rejoin the G8, and its reintegration into the global economy.\n \n\n   \n  The plan would see “all parties” in the war “receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court for the crime of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children. The plan calls for the return of “all civilian detainees and hostages,” including children, and the exchange of all prisoners of war and bodies.\n \n\n   \n  The draft calls for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to “be launched under the supervision of the IAEA, and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has made it very clear since day one, and even on the campaign trail, that he wants to see this war come to an end. He has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides of this war, Russia and Ukraine alike, for their refusal to commit to a peace agreement,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing. “Nevertheless, the president and his national security team are steadfast in seeing this war come to an end.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt rejected suggestions the plan was overly weighted toward Moscow, and said the administration had “talked equally with both sides” to create it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine, and we believe that it should be acceptable to both sides, and we’re working very hard to get it done,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Wednesday the document was a “list of potential ideas” rather than a completed proposal.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he wrote in  a post on X.  “And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some of the provisions being floated are likely to draw criticism from Ukraine and its backers since it would require significant land concessions. The two regions that  form the Donbas , Luhansk and Donetsk, are still partially held by Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal echoes a  peace proposal from talks  in Istanbul in the early weeks of the war in 2022, repeating some of Moscow’s wider geopolitical demands about Ukraine’s armed forces and allegiances.\n \n\n   \n    Talks in Ukraine\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with Zelensky in Ukraine on Thursday and delivered him the Trump administration’s proposed peace plan, a US defense official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll and Zelensky discussed “a collaborative plan to achieve peace in Ukraine” and “agreed on an aggressive timeline for signature,” the defense official said. The official clarified that the US expected Zelensky to sign a framework with the US to work toward an eventual peace agreement, not sign onto a final peace deal itself.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how aggressive that timeline is, or whether Zelensky agreed to its points. European and Ukrainian officials told CNN on Wednesday that the plan appears to contain unacceptable and maximalist demands from Russia, including ceding territory in the eastern Donbas region that Russia does not even currently control.\n \n\n   \n  But the Ukrainian presidential office said Thursday on X that “the President of Ukraine has officially received from the American side a draft plan which, in the American side’s assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The President of Ukraine outlined the fundamental principles that matter to our people, and following today’s meeting, the parties agreed to work on the plan’s provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war,” the Ukrainian presidential office said, adding that Zelensky expects to speak with Trump in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why the Army was tasked with delivering the peace plan rather than diplomats, the defense official said the Army “comes from a trusted position” with the Ukrainians, and is also in Ukraine to hold meetings on battlefield innovation — a topic Driscoll has been deeply involved in throughout his tenure as secretary.\n \n\n   \n  “We come from a trusted position. The US Army is a proven Ukraine ally,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundhog Day’\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat echoed a Western official’s description of some of the details of the proposal. The person told CNN that the new effort, which repeats many of Moscow’s maximalist demands dating back to 2022, reminded them of “Groundhog Day,” a film in which events repeat themselves over and over.\n \n\n   \n  A European envoy based in Ukraine said the plan had caught the diplomatic community completely by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “This has all been gone through before and rejected, and now we’re back to square one,” the diplomat said. “For the Ukrainians, it is just a non-starter and with good reason. It would just be inviting the Russians to come back again at a future date. It would be political suicide for any Ukrainian leader (to accept it), and it would be military suicide to hand over that fortified area.”\n \n\n   \n  The diplomat also described foreign ministries in Europe and elsewhere calling contacts in Washington for guidance on the plan only to be told they were equally in the dark.\n \n\n   \n  “We have heard directly from people in the State Department and on Capitol Hill that nobody knew anything about this plan until it was leaked yesterday,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  “People who should have known about it, knew nothing about it … There’s a lot of annoyance and confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In her first public comments since reports of the plan emerged, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told reporters Thursday that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Poland’s foreign minister Radosław Sikorski, meanwhile, told CNN that any plans should involve Europe and leave Kyiv with the capacity to defend itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a much bigger stake in this than the US, and therefore Ukraine, but also Europe, has to be involved,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said work on the talks was continuing “at the technical level between the teams” and that they were “carefully studying all of our partners’ proposals, expecting the same respectful attitude towards Ukraine’s position.”\n \n\n   \n  Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, told the Washington Post Live, “This is the start of a good process.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we’re finally having the leadership of the president of the United States, and this leadership is backed up by a real process, I think this is serious,” she said.   \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s special envoy,  Steve Witkoff , has been leading the effort, CNN reported on Wednesday, with a source saying the negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal. A US official said Witkoff had been quietly working on the plan for a month, with input from both the Ukrainians and the Russians on the terms they could accept.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, reiterated its denial that it was working with the US on a peace proposal for Ukraine, saying Thursday there were “no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have nothing new to add to what was said in Anchorage,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, referencing a meeting between Putin and Trump in Alaska in August. “We have no new developments.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Carey, Nick Paton Walsh, Brian Abel, and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/us-navy-south-china-sea-aircraft-salvage-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:31:00-05:00","title":"US Navy Trying to Pull Crashed Aircraft from Bottom of South China Sea","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Navy is attempting to recover an F/A-18 Super Hornet and an MH-60 helicopter that crashed within 30 minutes of each other in the South China Sea during routine operations off the USS Nimitz.

All crew members were rescued.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy confirmed to CNN on Friday that a salvage ship was operating in the South China Sea, while not revealing the specific location where the aircraft crashed or where the salvage ship is now.\n \n\n   \n  “USNS SALVOR (T-ARS 52), a Safeguard-class salvage ship operated by Military Sealift Command, is on-scene conducting operations in support of the recovery efforts,” said Cmdr. Matthew Comer, a spokesperson for the Navy’s 7th Fleet in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  The Salvor is capable of lifting objects weighing up to 300 tons off the seafloor, according to Navy documents. The maximum takeoff weight of the newest F/A-18 models on the Nimitz is about 33 tons while the MH-60 weighs around 11 tons.\n \n\n   \n  While neither the F/A-18 nor the MH-60 are the most modern of the Navy’s aircraft, experts say the wrecks could yield useful intelligence if they fall into the hands of an adversary.\n \n\n   \n  “Acquiring an air frame and surviving systems will … provide valuable insights into its technological strengths and how to defeat it tactically,” said Carl Schuster, the former head of the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that an F/A-18 has never fallen into Chinese hands, but if one did, Beijing could gather information that could help it improve People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carrier-based J-15T jets, which are not considered as advanced as the F/A-18.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the MH-60 carries anti-submarine warfare systems that are likely more advanced than China’s, Schuster said.\n \n\n   \n  “China is now prioritizing the upgrading of its anti-submarine warfare systems. So, recovering that helicopter should enjoy a high priority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot confirm whether China is making any attempt to get to the lost US aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea, in defiance of an international court ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The current US recovery effort follows  a similar mission  in 2022, when an F-35 jet, the Navy’s most-advanced fighter,  crashed while attempting to land  on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.\n \n\n   \n  The F-35 was eventually pulled up from 12,400 feet (3,700 meters) of water by a Navy recovery team.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, China has fortified its territorial claims by constructing military installations on contested islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The US says China’s assertions and military buildup threaten freedom of navigation in the waterway, through which trade worth trillions of dollars passes every year.\n \n\n   \n  US forces maintain a steady presence in the region to push back on Chinese sovereignty claims and support Washington’s allies and partners.\n \n\n   \n  But Schuster said Beijing has an edge on getting to wrecks in the South China Sea just based on proximity.\n \n\n   \n  “If China makes it a race, it enjoys homefield advantage, if you will, and can be expected to impede our recovery efforts” if possible, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said after the crashes that it could offer humanitarian assistance to the US Navy if needed.\n \n\n   \n  But a spokesperson also said that the crashes occurred during what he called “US military exercises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The US has been flexing muscles by frequently sending military vessels and aircraft to the South China Sea. This is the root cause of security issues at sea and disruption to regional peace and stability,” spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/trump-epstein-mamdani-democrats-feud-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"After high-profile missteps, Trump seizes on a new feud and a new potential adversary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a period of political turmoil, Donald Trump escalates a new feud with Democrats by reacting aggressively to a video in which lawmakers, including Air Force veteran Chrissy Houlahan, emphasized that military personnel must not follow illegal orders.

And at a White House meeting Friday, he’ll go head-to-head with the next mayor of New York,  Zohran Mamdani , a democratic socialist he’s planning to brand as the unacceptable “communist” face of the Democratic Party next year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political touch deserted him in recent days. He’s heard speculation about whether his decadelong grip on the GOP base is slipping. His missteps amplified the big question over Epstein — why is he so desperate to stop the evidence coming out? And his attempt to empathize with voters over the cost of living  became a farce  when he accused Democrats of stealing the world “affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  So you just knew the president, who has gotten  more irascible by the day , would look for an opening.\n \n\n   \n  And he found it, taking the chance to ignite the kind of political storm that obliterates everything in its path, drags his outraged foes onto his preferred political ground, rallies conservative media and solidifies his base.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tried to seize back the initiative — in the inflammatory way that only he can — in a post of social media posts and reposts that culminated by a warning that a group of Democratic lawmakers were guilty of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  His fury was provoked by a video from lawmakers who — unlike the commander in chief — were veterans of the military or intelligence services reminding members of the armed services that they  do not have to obey any illegal orders .\n \n\n   \n    ‘Never in a million years …’\n \n\n   \n  By any objective measure, Trump’s response was inflammatory and disproportionate in the country’s current climate of political violence. After all, this was a president of the United States ostensibly calling for the prosecution and possible execution of members of Congress. That’s not just an affront to decency and presidential decorum; it’s an assault on the foundations of constitutional, republican government and the separation of powers.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s dangerous. Republicans accused Democrats of inciting violence after two assassination attempts against Trump and the killing of conservative icon Charlie Kirk. It’s hard to see how this is any different. The president’s comments also contrasted with the conciliatory tone of one of his erstwhile political friends, MAGA icon  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia , who apologized Sunday on CNN for her role in “toxic politics.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the Democrats who appears in the video expressed her shock.\n \n\n   \n  “I never in a million years, thought I’d be talking to you tonight about the fact that the president of the United States has called for my death by hanging for sedition and treason. And called for it because I and a number of other people published a video that says you have to follow the law,” Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, loves these kinds of fights.\n \n\n   \n  By any normal political standards, they’d be potential career enders for a top political figure. But Trump uses them, as he did Thursday, to get Democrats to make arguments in defense of institutions, the Constitution, civility and traditional presidential behavior. Their points are often well made. But they can often seem esoteric and off-topic to voters far from Washington who are more concerned with economic security or the cost of health care. In recent elections, Democratic warnings about Trump fracturing norms and legal constraints and threatening the “soul” of the nation haven’t always worked.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the controversies whip up Trump’s conservative media cheerleaders and activists and sets up a loyalty test for Republicans wary of breaking with him.\n \n\n   \n  The country has seen it all before, multiple times: In Trump’s racist “birther” campaign against President Barack Obama; in his mockery of the late Sen. John McCain’s war record; in his false claims that he won the 2020 election. It’s a technique that has often worked for Trump. He might alienate half the country, but it’s one of the keys to his staunch support from his GOP base and his capacity to always portray himself as an anti-establishment scourge and an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  One question now, however, amid some of his worst-ever approval ratings and struggles with the economy, is whether Trump’s antics may begin to disgust even some voters who have always stood by him.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans face familiar political dodgeball\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s bombshell was typical of the distraction tactics that Trump has always used and that some of his critics have sometimes accused the news media of repeatedly falling for. Yet Trump’s “distraction” gambits are often so unhinged or threatening to basic American values that it’s inevitable that they create huge shock and fierce debate. They require pushback from his opponents, even if it dilutes their messages.\n \n\n   \n  As usual, Trump’s detonation of a new controversy forced Republicans on Capitol Hill to dance on the head of a political pin, with some deploying the classic excuse that they hadn’t read the posts.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson gingerly tried to separate himself from the president’s comments, saying the words “are not the ones that I would use.” He told CNN’s Manu Raju that “obviously, I don’t think that this is… these are crimes punishable by death or any of that.”\n \n\n   \n  Another close Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said the president’s comments were “over the top.” And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has questioned the legality of administration attacks on alleged drug-trafficker boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, said he didn’t think it was a “good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked whether the president really wanted the execution of members of Congress. She replied: “No.” But true to Trump’s lifetime mantra, she counterattacked, sketching an argument other Republicans adopted that the video was an attempt to get members of the armed forces to disobey the commander in chief.\n \n\n   \n  This is a misrepresentation. But it created sufficient political heat to blur reality while making the president’s out-of-bounds outburst seem just like one side of a political back-and-forth. Johnson, for instance, said that what the legislators did was “unprecedented in American history, and it should be called out, and that’s what the president has expressed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some might question why the Democrats chose to make their video — and to give the president an opportunity to change the subject after he’s spent days flailing over the Epstein matter and the cost of living. And any political move involving the military risks creating a drama that leaves servicemembers in the middle of a partisan firestorm.\n \n\n   \n  A counterargument would be that there is deep concern among many lawmakers — one that is especially acute for combat veterans — that Trump will ask service members to undertake unlawful attacks and missions. This is not hypothetical.  As CNN’s Aaron Blake reported , there have been many occasions when Trump’s foreign policy or military ventures have raised questions of legality.\n \n\n   \n  Judges have often ruled that administration policies infringed the law. Trump has sent troops into American cities on questionable grounds. His actions near Venezuela have many on Capitol Hill fearing an illegal war. And his threats of retribution need to be taken seriously since he’s turned the Justice Department into his engine of personal retribution.\n \n\n   \n  And after all, the Democrats in the video were only restating a principle that every servicemember understands — even if the question of deciding whether an order is a legal or not can be fraught and imprecise during the fog of war.\n \n\n   \n    High-stakes White House showdown looms\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s meeting with Mamdani at the White House on Friday is high stakes for both men.\n \n\n   \n  Both are New Yorkers; both won power through populist politics. Each harnessed a political moment and won power against insider, establishment elites.\n \n\n   \n  But while presidential power dwarfs that of a mere mayor-to-be, some comparisons may also be unflattering to Trump, who at 79 is closer to the end of his political career than the 34-year-old Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made his intentions clear with Mamdani. He’s setting up the mayor-elect as a political foil and a symbol of all Democrats to try to dispute their party’s more mainstream credentials ahead of the midterm elections next year. “Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting,” Trump said on his Truth Social network on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The president threatened during the mayoral campaign to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won because “as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Mamdani is not a communist, and anyone who understands the deprivations and tyranny of communist rule in the Soviet Union and elsewhere would see the comparison as absurd. But he’s been  enthusiastic in his democratic socialism , and Trump will be hoping that his attacks can brand the incoming mayor and his followers nationwide as extreme.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting, if it takes place in the Oval Office, before the cameras, will be a huge test for Mamdani. The president has not hesitated to humiliate some past visitors on television,  most notoriously Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . But Mamdani will also know that some of the president’s ire can sometimes be defused by flattery.\n \n\n   \n  The next mayor of New York City will be keen to show he can stand up to Trump — and to maneuver politically ahead of what could be a year of confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  And any new eruptions by the president, after a week in which he’s looked like he’s racing off the rails, might only further underscore doubts over his political health.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/asia/philippines-alice-guo-jailed-scams-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Philippines jails former mayor - who officials say faked her nationality to get the job – for human trafficking","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Philippine court has convicted former mayor Alice Guo (also known as Guo Huaping), an alleged Chinese national who falsified her Filipino citizenship to run for office, of human trafficking.

\nUpdated: \n        9:59 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Philippine court on Thursday convicted a  former mayor , who officials say is a Chinese national, of human trafficking charges for helping establish an illegal online gaming complex in a northern province where hundreds of Chinese and other foreign nationals were forced to conduct scams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pasig city regional trial court in metropolitan Manila sentenced Alice Guo to life in prison with seven other Filipino and Chinese co-accused, and ordered them to pay a fine of 2 million pesos ($34,000) each and compensate several trafficking victims, who filed the complaints.\n \n\n   \n  Guo denied all allegations against her and says she is a Filipino citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Vast online scam centers have  flourished  in Southeast Asia in recent years, especially in the border areas of  Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar . The UN has estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped in virtual slavery by gangs who force them to financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.\n \n\n   \n  In the Philippines, scam operations rapidly built vast compounds with buildings or rented upscale offices in Manila’s financial districts and moved around large numbers of workers by bribing authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine authorities allege that Guo is a Chinese national named Guo Huaping, who faked Filipino citizenship to run for mayor of the town of Bamban in northern Tarlac province, where she ran a sprawling illegal scam compound near the town hall.\n \n\n   \n  “They used the parcels of land and buildings to house the trafficked workers and to force them to work as scammers,” the court said in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a ban on hundreds of mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations, which proliferated under the administration of previous President Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos accused the gaming operations of crimes including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnapping and murder.\n \n\n   \n  Many have been raided and shut down since then, with tens of thousands of trafficked workers rescued and sent back to their home countries. But more scam centers remain in operation, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “The conviction of Alice Guo, also known as Guo Hua Ping, is a victory against corruption, human trafficking, cybercrime and many other transnational crimes,” said Sen. Risa Hontiveros. “But it is far from over.”\n \n\n   \n  Hontiveros led televised Senate inquiries last year that exposed underground online scam operations in the Philippines, along with Guo’s alleged criminal involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine security officials and Hontiveros have said the scam centers operated by Guo and other Chinese nationals may have also been used for espionage by China, which has had increasingly fierce territorial conflicts with the Philippines in the South China Sea and has strongly opposed the presence of American forces in the country. The Philippines is the oldest US treaty ally in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to demand accountability from every government agency that failed in their duties, and we will continue to investigate the full extent of Chinese intelligence operations in our country,” Hontiveros said. “And to all others who enabled Alice Guo’s criminal empire: the Philippines is not a playground for exploitation, infiltration and espionage.”\n \n\n   \n  Guo has not been charged with espionage and she denies any connection to spying.\n \n\n   \n  The town of Bamban is located several kilometers (miles) from a Philippine air force base, where American forces have been allowed to maintain a rotating presence with their aircraft and weapons under a 2014 defense pact.\n \n\n   \n  Guo was dismissed from her post as mayor last year by a state Ombudsman, who cited grave misconduct. She fled the Philippines in July 2024, but was tracked down in  Indonesia , where she was arrested and deported to the Philippines.

AM EST, Fri November 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fatima Bosch of Mexico has been named Miss Universe 2025 in a scandal-hit competition where she emerged as a fan favorite after she was  berated  by a Thai pageant director during a pre-pageant meeting, triggering a walk out by contestants.\n \n\n   \n  The 25-year-old humanitarian and volunteer was crowned by last year’s winner  Victoria Kjær Theilvig  from Denmark.\n \n\n   \n  Miss Universe is widely known as the “Super Bowl” of beauty pageants and draws millions of viewers each year. Delegates for each country are selected via local pageants that license local rights from the Miss Universe Organization.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Praveenar Singh came runner up, with Venezuela’s Stephany Abasali,  Philippines’ Ahtisa Manalo  and Ivory Coast’s Olivia Yacé also making it to the top 5.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand, this year’s host country, has a vibrant and lucrative pageant industry with one of the largest fanbases in Asia,  alongside the Philippines. \n \n\n   \n  The event featured representatives from 120 countries. Nadeen Ayoub became the first woman to represent  Palestinian people  at the pageant, and made it to the final 30 semifinalists before she was eliminated. Friday’s finale was hosted by American comedian Steve Byrne and opened with a performance by Thai singer Jeff Satur.\n \n\n   \n  Following the swimwear round, the top 30 contestants were narrowed down to 12, and then down to 5 after the evening round.\n \n\n   \n  Finalists were asked questions including which global issue they would speak about in front of the United Nations General Assembly, and how they would use the Miss Universe platform to empower young girls.\n \n\n   \n  “Believe in the power of your authenticity,” Bosch said. “Your dreams matter, your heart matters. Never let anyone make you doubt your worth.”\n \n\n   \n  The competition took place over three weeks, with delegates traveling around the country to rehearse and participate in events.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the beauty queens competed in the national costume showcase, which saw contestants donning flamboyant outfits designed to highlight their homelands. Miss USA, Audrey Eckert, paid homage to her home with an  elaborate bald eagle costume  designed by Simon Villalba.\n \n\n   \n  The contestant from Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, took a scary tumble during the evening gown round at Wednesday’s preliminaries and was carried away in a stretcher, according to social media videos which circulated of her fall. Miss Universe President Raul Rocha said in an  update to Instagram  that Henry was “under good care” in hospital and that she had not broken any bones.\n \n\n   \n    Pageant controversies\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Miss Universe competition was beset by controversy and internal drama in the weeks leading up to coronation night. The walk out sparked conversations over the merits of the international beauty pageant which claims to promote female empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  At a live-streamed pre-pageant meeting earlier this month, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly scolded Bosch ,  for not posting enough promotional content, appearing to call her a “dumbhead,” though Nawat denied this, insisting that he had actually accused her of causing “damage.”\n \n\n   \n  After Bosch pushed back against the insults, Nawat called security to escort her out of the room. Other contestants then stood up and walked out in solidarity.\n \n\n   \n  The incident drew global backlash, including from Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum, who described it as an “aggression” that Bosch handled with “dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization condemned Nawat’s behavior and limited his role in the pageant. Nawat apologized in a livestreamed welcome ceremony and declined to comment further on the incident to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Then, Miss Universe 1996, Alicia Machado, was criticized for making racist comments in an Instagram live video discussing the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Machado referred to Nawat as “that despicable Chinese,” and when a commentor pointed out he is Thai, Machado said “Chinese, Thai, Korean. To me all these people with slanted eyes like this are all Chinese,” while pulling up the corners of her eyes.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s representative did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Judge steps down, says pageant is rigged\n \n\n   \n  Two judges abruptly stepped down from the competition days before the winner was crowned, with one accusing the pageant of being rigged.\n \n\n   \n  Composer Omar Harfouch said on Instagram he had resigned from the eight-member judging panel, and claimed there was a secret, “impromptu” panel of judges who had pre-selected the top 30 contestants in advance of the final.\n \n\n   \n  “I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,” Harfouch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization said Harfouch’s claims “mischaracterize” the judging process.\n \n\n   \n  “The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,” the organization said in a  statement. \n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A second judge, former French soccer star Claude Makélélé, stepped down the same day, citing “unforeseen personal reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  “I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard,” he said  on Instagram .\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization saw a leadership shakeup after Thai media tycoon Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip stepped down in June. Mario Búcaro was  appointed the new CEO  at the end of October, just days before delegates arrived. Jakkaphong, who is also a transgender rights advocate,  bought the organization for $20 million in 2022 , but her company  filed for bankruptcy  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Next year’s Miss Universe contest will take place in Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n   This article was updated with results and details of the competition.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/chicago-marimar-martinez-shooting-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"Federal judge dismisses charges against Chicago woman shot after being accused of ramming car at law enforcement vehicle","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Georgia Alexakis, dismissed federal charges against Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, who was shot after allegedly ramming a Customs and Border Protection agent’s vehicle in Chicago on October 4, 2025.

shot after being accused of ramming car at law enforcement vehicle \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, Bill Kirkos, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:29 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Thursday dismissed federal charges against a woman shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago after allegedly  ramming into his car .\n \n\n   \n  The ruling from US District Judge Georgia Alexakis came hours after prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charges in a striking reversal by the US government, court documents show.\n \n\n   \n  Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz – who was driving a different vehicle – had entered not guilty pleas to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.\n \n\n   \n  The unprecedented move marks the latest development in a high-profile case that garnered public scrutiny and left a federal judge skeptical of how the investigation was handled.\n \n\n   \n  After the hearing Thursday, Ruiz was seen outside the courtroom hugging a crying loved one as a smiling Martinez told reporters, “I’m just blessed. I’m happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been hard,” she said. “I can’t sleep, but now I’m gonna go sleep.”\n \n\n   \n  Martinez had been accused of closely pursuing Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum and hitting his car on October 4. But Martinez’s defense attorney, Christopher Parente, alleged the opposite, saying it was actually the agent who sideswiped Martinez. Parente said, “This case was going to be a winner at trial regardless.”\n \n\n   \n  “These agents were lying about what happened,” he added following the dismissal. “Miss Martinez never rammed anybody. These agents hit Miss Martinez. These agents jumped out and shot Miss Martinez, a US citizen whose only crime was warning her fellow community members that ICE was in the neighborhood.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors had alleged Martinez and Ruiz “aggressively and erratically” followed and then rammed into Exum and other agents inside his vehicle who were on security detail in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Joseph Fitzpatrick, spokesperson and assistant US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said in a statement Thursday his office is “constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz, the largest ever law enforcement surge in the Northern District of Illinois.”\n \n\n   \n  “This continuous review process applies to all matters — whether charged or under investigation,” Fitzpatrick said. “It helps ensure that the interests of justice are served in each and every case, and that those cases that are charged are appropriately adjudicated through our federal court system.”\n \n\n   \n  When reached by CNN for comment on the judge dismissing charges against Martinez, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin restated previous claims that Martinez was one of the drivers who rammed agents and referred questions on the charges to the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After the collision last month, Exum stepped out of his vehicle and fired his weapon five times at Martinez, according to the charging complaint. Martinez suffered five gunshot wounds, Parente previously told CNN. McLaughlin called the shots “defensive.”\n \n\n   \n    Text messages and the federal vehicle were key in the court case\n \n\n   \n  Text messages from Exum were displayed in court earlier this month as Parente sought to prove his claim  the government potentially destroyed evidence  that may have supported the defense when it released Exum’s damaged vehicle and allowed the agent to drive it more than 1,000 miles to his home state of Maine.\n \n\n   \n  Exum texted an  article from The Guardian  on October 7 to a group of other agents, which quoted Parente saying Martinez had “seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum wrote in the next text message.\n \n\n   \n  Another message to the group read, “I have a MOF amendment to add to my story. I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum explained to the judge an “MOF” is a “Miserable Old F**ker” who is always trying to one-up someone wherever possible.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what exactly Exum was responding to, because the text conversations were redacted when presented to the court.\n \n\n   \n  When asked to explain the text message, Exum said, “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Exum defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk and “I did what I had to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Referencing the messages, Parente said, “He’s going to pay for those shots, and he’s not going to be as proud and as arrogant as he was when he testified in this courthouse a few weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Alexakis  said she was skeptical  about why the cars of Martinez and Ruiz were kept in Chicago as evidence, while the Border Patrol agent’s car was released and allowed to travel normally.\n \n\n   \n  “What gives me great pause is the fact the cars have been treated differently,” Alexakis said previously.\n \n\n   \n  Government attorneys defended federal agents’ decisions, saying the FBI had preserved any evidence they believed was relevant before releasing the car back onto the street.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Omar Jimenez and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/censure-process-congress-bipartisan-reform","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:04:00-05:00","title":"Bipartisan Push to Reform Censure Process Emerges in Congress After Flurry of Complaints Against Lawmakers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early November 2025, a surge of censure complaints against sitting members of Congress—such as retiring Democrat Chuy García and Democrat Stacey Plaskett—sparked bipartisan concern over the increasing frequency and political nature of the censure process.

This week alone, lawmakers had already weighed three different complaints in just as many days.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, retiring Democratic  Rep. Chuy García  of Illinois was censured for allegedly coordinating his own retirement to ensure his hand-picked replacement would win his seat next year. It was fellow Democrat, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, who forced the House to take up the symbolic resolution against García, infuriating members of her party.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, 22 Democrats voted with Gluesenkamp Perez to reprimand Garcia, along with 213 Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  The same day, a vote to censure  Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett , for texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, failed on a 209-214 vote. Three Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure and three Republicans registering as “present.”\n \n\n   \n  If the vote to censure Plaskett had passed, Democrats had planned to bring up a resolution against Florida GOP Rep. Cory Mills, who has faced a swirl of controversies in his time in Congress, including an  allegation of assault  against Mills and  accusations from  an ex-girlfriend that he threatened to release sexually explicit images and videos of her.\n \n\n   \n  But on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina brought a complaint against Mills, pointing to individuals who served with Mills in the Army disputing his version of events that led him to be recommended for the Bronze Star, which was reported on by  NOTUS . The complaint was  referred to the House Ethics Committee  after a vote to censure him failed despite seven Republicans joining Mace in favor of the measure.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the wave of complaints this week, Democratic Rep. Don Beyer and GOP Rep. Don Bacon have sponsored a bill to raise the threshold for a censure resolution to 60%.\n \n\n   \n  “I just think we’ve got out of control,” Bacon said Thursday. “It should be more bipartisan when we do one.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alison Main, Aileen Graef, Sarah Ferris, Ellis Kim and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/ncaa-sports-gambling-rule-recission-tally","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-05:00","title":"NCAA Currently Falling Short to Rescind Rule That Would Allow College Athletes to Gamble on Professional Sports, Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the NCAA approaches a 5 p.m. ET deadline on November 20, 2025, to rescind a rule allowing college athletes, coaches, and staff to gamble on professional sports, it faces a critical gap: only 188 out of 361 Division I schools have requested rescission, falling short of the required 241 (two-thirds) to block implementation.

submitted the paperwork to request the recission, the source said.

Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not. But citing the growth in legal sports betting nationwide – now permissible in 38 states – and arguing that sports betting was now available to regular college students, the NCAA agreed to change its policy. Betting on college sports would still be against the rules.\n \n\n   \n  The rule change originally was meant to go into effect on November 1 – a week after the sweeping indictments involving the NBA and members of New York crime families. While the optics weren’t good, the actual implementation of the rule was delayed because of a technicality – less than 75% of the cabinet members voted in favor of the change, triggering an automatic rescission period.\n \n\n   \n  That rescission period ends Friday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/style/frida-kahlo-portrait-record-woman-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:54:00-05:00","title":"Frida Kahlo self-portrait sells for $54.7 million, setting new record for female artists","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Frida Kahlo's self-portrait 'El sueño (La cama)' sold for $54.7 million at Sotheby’s in New York, becoming the most valuable artwork by a female artist in auction history, surpassing Georgia O’Keeffe’s previous record.

Another of the Mexican artist’s self portraits “Diego y yo” (Diego and I) previously held the title for second most expensive artwork sold by a female artist after also being auctioned by Sotheby’s, New York, in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  When sold, that painting became the most expensive piece of Latin American art ever.

Curling green vines envelop her body, while a skeleton wired with dynamite and holding a bouquet of dried flowers lies above her.\n \n\n   \n  The bed was a regular motif in Kahlo’s work. She was confined to her bed for long periods of time as she endured a life of chronic pain following a near-fatal bus accident and subsequent surgeries.\n \n\n   \n  During the long recovery after the accident, Kahlo’s family set up an adapted easel and fitted a mirror to the canopy of the bed so she could continue to paint while lying flat. “I am not dead and I have a reason to live. That reason is painting,” she wrote at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Kahlo painted the piece in 1940, which was a turbulent time for the Mexican artist. It was the year that she remarried Diego Rivera after divorcing the fellow artist a year earlier, and was also the year that her former lover, the Russian revolutionary Leon Trosky, was assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  In an email to CNN prior to the auction, Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby’s head of Latin American art, said “El sueño (La cama)” had been “one of very few works of this calibre still in private hands.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frida Kahlo occupies a completely singular place in art history. There’s an almost spiritual connection people have with her paintings, which are so deeply personal yet at the same time resonate universally.

Rhoades resigned Thursday, a week after he took a leave of absence for personal reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Rhoades had also stepped down last week from his role as chairman of the College Football Playoff selection committee.\n \n\n   \n  Linda Livingstone, the school’s president, said in a letter Thursday that Rhoades had informed her of his decision to step away from his position at Baylor. She said the move was effective immediately.\n \n\n   \n  After Rhoades began his leave of absence November 12, the private Big 12 school said it was investigating unspecified allegations against him. The status of that investigation, or if it is still ongoing, was not immediately clear after he left the job.\n \n\n   \n  The school, without giving further details, said last week that allegations against Rhoades did not involve Title IX, student-athlete welfare or NCAA rules violations, and did not involve the football program.\n \n\n   \n  Rhoades took over as Baylor’s AD in July 2016, in the wake of the revelation of a sprawling sexual assault scandal that cost two-time Big 12 champion football coach Art Briles his job. That NCAA case against the Bears wasn’t resolved until 2021, when the school was placed on four years of probation.\n \n\n   \n  Livingstone said co-interim ADs Jovan Overshown and Cody Hall will continue in their current roles leading the department during the search for a new athletic director.\n \n\n   \n  “Be assured we remain deeply committed to competing at the highest levels of athletics, both in competition and the classroom,” Livingstone wrote. “I am certain that we will find a new AD who shares in this competitive commitment, aligns with and supports Baylor’s Christian mission, and can lead us into this next era of intercollegiate athletics.”\n \n\n   \n  Rhoades was in the second year of a three-year CFP selection committee appointment, and his first season as chairman. He was replaced as chairman by Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek, while Utah AD Mark Harlan was appointed to fill Rhoades’ vacancy on the committee as the Big 12 representative after previously serving a one-year term in 2023.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/justice-department-adam-schiff-ed-martin-bill-pulte-christine-bish","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:52:00-05:00","title":"Justice Department Investigating Alleged Impersonation of Federal Agents in Mortgage Fraud Probes of Democrats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether individuals impersonated federal agents during mortgage fraud probes into prominent Democrats, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Cole, Casey Gannon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:52 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether people impersonated federal agents in mortgage fraud probes of prominent Democrats, a development that could complicate efforts to prosecute political enemies of President Donald Trump, people briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The new probe led by the Maryland US Attorney’s Office and the Federal Housing Finance Agency inspector general is examining the handling of the mortgage fraud investigations into California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to sources.\n \n\n   \n  One witness in the Schiff matter, a Republican from California named Christine Bish, said she traveled to Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday morning in response to a grand jury subpoena. Bish said she spoke to federal investigators inside the courthouse who asked her about people who told her they were working with Trump administration officials leading the mortgage probes.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re investigating each other,” Bish later told CNN in a telephone interview. “It’s stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  The subpoena Bish received demanded she give to the prosecutors in Maryland any communications she had with “any person or persons claiming to be” working under the Federal Housing Finance Director  Bill Pulte , the Justice Department official  Ed Martin , or others “claiming to be acting at the direction or request” of them or their offices, according to the subpoena reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte helped to prompt the Schiff and James investigations, as well as mortgage fraud-related inquiries into other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte in particular has played an extraordinary role in the probes by publicly making criminal referrals to the Justice Department, a step normally taken through mortgage investigators in his agency. And Martin has touted his pursuit of Trump’s political foes.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors are also looking into whether grand jury materials gathered in the James case were illegally shared with people who were not authorized to review it, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. James has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department declined to comment. The FHFA, its inspector general’s office and Martin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Pulte also were unsuccessful.\n \n\n   \n  Bish, who previously ran for office in California, has publicly said she had information to share about Schiff related to his mortgages. She told CNN on Thursday that when she came to the Greenbelt courthouse, she believed she was going to provide grand jury testimony on Schiff and mortgage fraud, but that prosecutors “seemed more concerned” about looking into whether “there was conspiracy or collusion between me and Pulte or me and Ed Martin.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she passed her independent findings on Schiff to Pulte’s office earlier this year, after she said his office contacted her directly.\n \n\n   \n  Schiff is one of Trump’s longtime political foes, with the president in September pushing in a Truth Social post for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute him.\n \n\n   \n  “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action,”  Trump wrote in the post . “Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office have been hesitant to proceed with charges against Schiff, CNN previously reported. Schiff has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crime, and his attorney declined to comment for this story Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re trying to tie me into some kind of clandestine conspiracy, it’s not there, and the best way to protect myself is to be open and honest and public,” Bish said Thursday, adding later: “Something’s not adding up. And I haven’t gotten to the bottom of it yet, but I will.”\n \n\n   \n  The interview questions Bish was asked on Thursday went beyond any probe into Schiff, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “They assured me, when they interviewed me, that the focus of the investigation was Adam Schiff. And I kept pulling the testimony back to Schiff, but it seemed like they were looking for more — stuff that doesn’t exist,” Bish said at the courthouse on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators focused their questions on two people whom Bish said reached out to her for information on Schiff.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people worked in the first Trump administration and claimed to work for Pulte, and Bish said she spoke to the person several times. The other person said he was affiliated with the mortgage agency Freddie Mac, according to Bish, and she said she spoke to him once.\n \n\n   \n  “You know – had I ever talked to Director Pulte? Had I ever talked to Ed Martin? Did I have any communication with them? And that’s where the conversation kept going back,” she added. “So I don’t know if they’re on a fishing expedition or you know what’s going on.”\n \n\n   \n  Bish said she has never spoken with Martin.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Evan Perez and Kara Scannell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments and comment. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/football-nfl-cowboys-ceedee-lamb-missed-curfew-explanation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00Z","title":"CeeDee Lamb Says Casino Visit Led to Curfew Violation with Fellow Dallas Cowboys Receiver George Pickens","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, Dallas Cowboys wide receivers, were benched for the first series of their 33-16 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders due to a curfew violation at the Red Rock Casino the night before the game.

reason behind China’s fury toward Japan’s Takaichi \n       \n  Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:36 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weeks into the job,  Japan ’s new leader has come face-to-face with what it means to cross  China ’s red line on Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  In the days since  Sanae Takaichi  suggested her country could respond militarily if China were to move to take control of Taiwan by force, Beijing has pulled out its economic pressure playbook: warning its citizens against travel and study there, suggesting there’ll be no market in China for Japan’s seafood exports, and unleashing a wave of wall-to-wall nationalist fervor pointed at the prime minister.\n \n\n   \n   The furor  appears carefully calibrated to send a warning to Japan – and other countries in the region – of what could happen if they even consider taking a stance at odds with China on Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that Beijing claims as its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  But the spat, which shows no sign of abating roughly two weeks on, also reveals something else: Beijing’s deep-seated concerns about the potential for changing military postures in Asia – as US allies ramp up defense spending and coordination in the face of its own  rising military might .\n \n\n   \n  No other country piques those concerns like Japan, whose Imperial Army in the 20th century invaded, occupied and waged atrocities on China and, decades earlier, colonized Taiwan – key pain points in China’s so-called “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers.\n \n\n   \n  Anti-Japanese sentiment has simmered in the country since that time – flaring up and gaining traction in recent years with nationalist hardliners’ voices becoming increasingly mainstream in China under strongman leader Xi Jinping.\n \n\n   \n  Reinforcing the ruling Communist Party’s longstanding determination to ensure history can never repeat itself, Xi has rapidly modernized China’s military and grown its global influence.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in Beijing’s eyes, Takaichi’s comments reveal that Japan does not respect the vast rebalancing of power that’s positioned China as an ascendant superpower – and that it has military ambitions that could threaten China’s rise.\n \n\n   \n  “For the first time, a Japanese leader has expressed ambitions for armed intervention in Taiwan and issued a military threat against China,” a commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily  said  earlier this week. “Behind this lies the dangerous attempt by Japan’s right-wing forces to break free from the constraints of the pacifist constitution and seek the status of a ‘military power.’”\n \n\n   \n    Japan’s ‘militarism’\n \n\n   \n  Japan has made a  sweeping shift  in its security posture in recent years, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, to boost its defense budget and acquire counterstrike capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  That’s come as Beijing has ramped up its military activities in the region, including around Taiwan – and as the US has pushed its allies for more burden-sharing on defense spending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response, but politicians – particularly among right wingers in Takaichi’s party – are increasingly wary of the implications for Tokyo if Beijing attacks Taiwan, which sits strategically to Japan’s south. This sentiment has resulted in a growing impetus to further expand Japan’s defense spending and even change the constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Now Takaichi, a hawkish figure who has previously drawn Beijing’s ire for questioning some of the narratives around imperial Japan’s culpability for its war atrocities, has taken the step of speaking plainly on the Taiwan issue. In the first days of her term, she also called for closer security ties with the US and is moving to accelerate the country’s defense build-up.\n \n\n   \n  In Beijing’s eyes,  according to  a social media account linked to the Chinese military, such efforts run the risk of seeing “the ‘ghost’ of militarism” reemerge “to wreak havoc in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  And that’s why some on the Japanese side feel that Beijing is lashing out now “to box Takaichi in and put her on the back foot early on – so she will be more reluctant to push forward on Japan’s investment in defense,” according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese troops killed more than 200,000 unarmed civilians during its occupation, and raped and tortured tens of thousands of women and girls, in what is known as the Nanjing Massacre, one of the most notorious wartime atrocities of the 20th century. Japan has repeatedly apologized and expressed remorse for its wartime atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  That era, however, has been front and center in China this year as Beijing marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II, when Japan’s surrender to Allied Forces freed China from its occupation and saw Taiwan handed over to the Nationalist-run Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese Communist Party established the People’s Republic of China in 1949 after emerging victorious from a civil war, while the defeated Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. Beijing has used the anniversary to justify its claim to the island – and broadcast concern about what it sees as Japan’s turn toward militarism.\n \n\n   \n  China sees taking control of Taiwan as a core piece of the “national rejuvenation” that it must complete by mid-century – a goal that, if Beijing decides must be achieved by force, could be heavily complicated by a stronger Japan.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, Takaichi’s comments can be summed up as “the wrong person, talking about the wrong thing” at the “wrong time,” according to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Defending its sovereignty’\n \n\n   \n  Despite Tokyo dispatching an envoy to Beijing earlier this week to calm the dispute, Beijing has showed no signs of dialing back its deluge of rhetoric.\n \n\n   \n  It’s instead insisting Tokyo retracts the comment – a position that offers neither side an easy way to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, China has continued to stoke nationalist feelings, including sabre-rattling from China’s military, which on Wednesday released a video titled “Don’t be too cocky.” Without mentioning Japan by name, it includes a rap crooning: “We’ve honed our skills through rigorous training, how can we allow you to be so cocky?”\n \n\n   \n  But it may be an image of Japan’s foreign ministry envoy Masaaki Kanai and his Chinese counterpart Liu Jinsong following their meeting in Beijing earlier this week that underscores why China won’t want to ease up pressure just yet.\n \n\n   \n  That image – showing Liu standing straight with his hands in his pockets, talking to Kanai who tilts his head forward while listening – has gone viral across Chinese social media.\n \n\n   \n  Commentators have referred to the Japanese diplomat as “bowing,” while they hailed the choice of Liu’s attire – a suit whose style is associated with China’s May Fourth anti-Imperialism movement of 1919.\n \n\n   \n  The symbolism, it appears, was no coincidence: “China’s stance in defending its sovereignty remains unchanged for a century,” said a caption on a post from state broadcaster CCTV.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/border-patrol-charlotte-gregory-bovino","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:45:00-05:00","title":"Charlotte Officials Say Border Patrol Operation Has Ended, But DHS Insists Immigration Enforcement Will Continue","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A five-day federal immigration enforcement operation in Charlotte, North Carolina — dubbed 'Operation Charlotte’s Web' and led by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino — resulted in over 370 arrests, widespread fear, and significant disruption to daily life, including school closures affecting over 30,000 students and the closure of a long-standing family-owned bakery.

Charlotte officials say Border Patrol operation has ended, but DHS insists immigration enforcement will continue \n       \n  By Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, Taylor Romine, Chris Boyette, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:45 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The dayslong immigration crackdown that arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week appeared to end with the same level of confusion it began with, as local officials announced the operation concluded Thursday while federal officials refuted those claims.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Thursday, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden issued a statement saying the federal immigration enforcement operation in the city had ended. But moments later, a top Department of Homeland Security official rejected that characterization.\n \n\n   \n  DHS dubbed the operation in Charlotte, which led to over 370 arrests, “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Over more than five days, enforcement actions disrupted life across the city, resulting in business closures, children kept out of school, and widespread fear in the community.\n \n\n   \n  At the helm of the operation was top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who, along with some of his federal agents, left Charlotte Thursday, according to a Homeland Security official, fueling confusion about the state of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the sheriff’s statement was released, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “Wrong. Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification on the operation’s status. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office says it stands by its statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to  what happened in Chicago  after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his agents are  expected to launch an operation in New Orleans  after the Thanksgiving holiday ,  as early as December 1, continuing the recent focus on city-specific immigration enforcement operations.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said  in a post  following McFadden’s announcement that she is “relieved for our community,” and urged the city to “come together” as they move forward.\n \n\n   \n  “We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said in a statement Thursday. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust.\n \n\n   \n    Federal agents leave behind a city rocked by fear and confusion\n \n\n   \n  In the few days that federal agents focused their immigration enforcement crackdown on North Carolina’s largest city,  fear and confusion  swept through the Charlotte community.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN’s Gustavo Valdes she had been getting questions from students such as, “What is going to happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?” and “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  She described having only nine students show up on one day this week, as parents were afraid to send their children to school or, in some cases, parents with legal status drove the children of undocumented parents to class.\n \n\n   \n   More than  30,000 students — about 20% of district enrollment — were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said, citing updated data from the beginning of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  When a CNN crew in a black SUV was parked near a school this week, an official asked them to move their vehicle because it resembled a CBP vehicle and was frightening parents picking up their children.\n \n\n   \n  One  nonprofit  estimates about half of the mom-and-pop businesses it works with have  closed at some point  during the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  A family-run Colombian bakery, which has closed only once in its 28-year history,  closed last week, with the family unsure of when it will reopen .\n \n\n   \n  While some in the community are expressing relief that the operation may be over, others remain skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that provides legal services to people in removal proceedings,  warned the community  not to “let your guard down” as ICE is still operating in the area and other parts of the state.\n \n\n   \n  “CBP might be leaving but ICE is still here!” the group said in an Instagram post.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte and Chicago could help New Orleans prepare\n \n\n   \n  While the Charlotte operation appears to have concluded, an immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans is expected as early as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Some in Charlotte’s community  adopted tactics  they saw activists use in Chicago, such as watching for raids, blowing warning whistles, and carrying signs advising people of their rights. In Charlotte,  some  also  stood outside the entrance  of a local ICE processing facility to block federal agents, a method frequently seen at the  Broadview ICE facility  near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Both cities  quickly mobilized  to train community members on how to respond if they saw an immigration raid or ICE presence.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte was a departure from what is typical in these operations, notably being much shorter — at less than a week — than the operation in Chicago, which started in early September.\n \n\n   \n  The operation also  took Charlotte by surprise , as President Donald Trump had not mentioned the city as a target. In contrast, while local and state officials in Chicago said federal officials  hadn’t shared details  about the operation or its timing, Trump  frequently named Chicago  as a  target  for a federal crime crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The focus now appears to be shifting to New Orleans, a city President Trump considered sending the National Guard to  as early as September . New Orleans would be one of the first Democratic-led cities in a Republican-led state targeted for an immigration enforcement operation. CNN has reached out to local and state officials to see how they are preparing for the potential operation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/fugees-pras-michel-sentenced-prison-obama","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00Z","title":"Fugees Rapper Pras Michel Sentenced to 14 Years in Prison Over Illegal Donations to Obama Campaign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pras Michel, a Grammy-winning member of the hip-hop group Fugees, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for illegally funneling over $120 million in foreign contributions from Malaysian billionaire Jho Low to former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign.

These are mostly preventable with the right precautions.\n \n\n   \n  I want to make sure that the food my family and I are preparing is safe—and so are the leftovers, so I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where her responsibilities included overseeing food safety.\n \n\n   \n   CNN:   What causes foodborne infections? \n \n\n   \n   Dr.   Leana Wen:  Foodborne infections are caused by pathogens, like bacteria, viruses and parasites. In the US, the most common form of foodborne infection is  norovirus , which is a contagious virus that spreads from person to person through sharing utensils or touching objects that an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth. There are also several bacteria that cause foodborne illness, including salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter and listeria.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What symptoms do people experience? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Typical symptoms of foodborne illness include abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Many people recover within 24 hours, but some can become very ill, depending on the pathogen and their underlying medical conditions. Those at highest risk for complications are young children, pregnant women, older individuals and people with immunocompromising medical illnesses.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: I’ve seen a lot of recalls for food products.  How do I make sure that the food I’m preparing is OK before placing it out at meals? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Rhere have been  several instances of high-profile food recalls , but it’s important to remember that the majority of foodborne illnesses occur in everyday settings that don’t involve high-profile cases. Definitely be aware of food recalls (the US government maintains a  comprehensive list of recent recalls ) and make sure that you don’t have products in your fridge or pantry that are deemed unsafe. But don’t obsess over it, as chances are that the food you buy will be safe. However, there are many other things that you can and need to do make sure you abide by safe food preparing practices.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Let’s talk about some of these best practices. How do I defrost my turkey safely? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This is a great question and applies not only to turkey but also to other poultry and meat. The concern is to keep bacteria from growing when the turkey thaws.\n \n\n   \n  There are  three ways to safely thaw turkey . The easiest, though the one that takes the longest, is to thaw in the refrigerator. You put the turkey in a container to prevent it from dripping onto other food. It generally takes 24 hours for each four to five pounds of turkey, so an 8-pound turkey could take two days, and a 12-pound turkey could take three days.\n \n\n   \n  The second way is to wrap the turkey in a leak-proof bag and submerge it in cold water. This takes about 30 minutes per pound, so the 8-pound turkey will take about 4 hours to thaw. You could use tap water and change the water every 30 minutes. It’s important to cook the turkey immediately after it is thawed to prevent bacteria growth.\n \n\n   \n  The third way is to use a microwave. How long it will take depends on the specific microwave. This is the fastest method, but because some parts of the turkey will start to cook during microwaving, it’s essential to cook the turkey right after thawing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not a good idea to leave the turkey thawing on the counter in a warm room. That’s because parts of the turkey may still be frozen while some parts reach high enough temperature for the bacteria to rapidly multiply.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How long can a Thanksgiving buffet sit out? Does it vary by dish? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The rule of thumb to keep in mind is the “two-hour rule.” Once the food is cooked, it should not be left at room temperature for  more than two hours . In the summer, if this is an outdoor picnic and the temperature is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, food should be refrigerated after an hour.\n \n\n   \n  This rule applies to all perishable foods, including meat, fish and milk products. Cooked leftovers should be refrigerated. The foods that do not need to be refrigerated according to the two-hour rule are baked goods such as cookies and cakes, dried meat such as jerky, whole fruit that is not chopped, and nuts.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What if the food is on a burner or in a slow cooker to keep it warm? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  The temperature at which bacteria multiples rapidly is between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. If the food is being kept warm by an appliance such that is over 140 degrees Fahrenheit — or if it’s being kept cooled at below 40 degrees Fahrenheit — this does not count toward the two-hour rule. But  within two hours  of removing from the warming or cooling apparatus, it needs to be refrigerated.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: The fridge is my friend, right? Can food go into the fridge so we can enjoy leftovers the next day? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Yes, if it is stored in a timely manner in the refrigerator. Leftovers can typically be kept in the fridge for  three to four days . They can also be frozen for three to four months.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other safety tips people should keep in mind before gatherings? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  We’ve talked about thawing and storage of leftovers, and we also need to discuss cooking or reheating to the right temperature. The temperature varies  depending  on the type of meat or fish. An internal meat thermometer is crucial for monitoring the temperature. Make sure that fish is cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and chicken, turkey and poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n \n\n   \n  Be aware of cross-contamination. Do not use containers or utensils you have used with raw meat or fish to touch other products, like vegetables and fruits.\n \n\n   \n  Also, remember that norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness. People who have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps or other symptoms of norovirus should not prepare food. Everyone should wash their hands often and well with soap and water.\n \n\n   \n  Event hosts should also ask that those who are experiencing signs of respiratory infection to stay home. And those who are especially vulnerable to severe illness due to underlying conditions should take additional precautions that are appropriate for their individual circumstance.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/hang-democrats-trump-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-05:00","title":"Why Democrats Are Warning About Trump Giving Illegal Orders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, a group of congressional Democrats released a video urging military personnel not to obey unlawful orders that President Donald Trump might issue, prompting Trump to accuse them of sedition and even suggest they deserve execution.

\n        7:33 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has yet again suggested that his  political   opponents  deserve to be executed. And yet again, he’s basing this argument on a rather novel legal theory and a dubious interpretation of the facts.\n \n\n   \n  A half-dozen congressional Democrats cut a video this week urging members of the military  not to obey unlawful orders  that Trump might issue. Trump then responded by issuing a series of social media posts suggesting these members had committed sedition and possibly even deserved to die.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from saying they should be arrested, to re-posting someone who said George Washington would “HANG THEM,” to saying “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Thursday that Trump  does not, in fact, want members of Congress put to death .\n \n\n   \n  But she otherwise stood by the idea that these members were acting dangerously and undermining the commander in chief. She said the members were urging members of the military to “defy the chain of command.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are literally saying to 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers to defy the chain of command – not to follow lawful orders,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  But that is not what they were literally saying.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the members were not urging anyone to disobey “lawful orders.” They explicitly referred in the video only to  unlawful  orders – and repeatedly so.\n \n\n   \n  The other problem is that “defying the chain of command” isn’t just something military servicemembers are  allowed  to do in such cases; it’s something they’re often  required  to do.\n \n\n   \n  The section of Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice dealing with failing to obey orders states that members can only be sanctioned for disobeying lawful orders. And servicemembers are generally obligated to not follow orders that are “manifestly unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  If there’s a potentially more legitimate objection to Democrats’ video, it’s that they’re erecting a straw man – basically that they’re inventing out of whole cloth the prospect of Trump issuing illegal orders, in order to make military servicemembers hesitant to abide his orders.\n \n\n   \n  This is the argument that some of Trump’s allies have gone for on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “If you can’t name the unlawful orders that these guys are bringing up in their video, you know, that just shows me that you don’t have the courage to even call out what you’re talking about,” Republican Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona said.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum in a separate segment pressed Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, one of the lawmakers in the video, repeatedly on the same subject.\n \n\n   \n  “What specific order from the commander in chief that we are asking our military to carry out are you objecting to?” MacCallum said. “This is very, very vague.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not as if this is a prospect Democrats have invented out of whole cloth. Trump has given them plenty to work with, including some things  Crow mentioned in the interview .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly proposed doing things – with the military and otherwise – that appear to be illegal. People who served with him have said he suggested illegal action. And Trump is certainly testing the bounds of the law with his use of the military even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  The big example right now is Trump’s strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean – strikes that have  killed more than 80 people  without a legal process.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that both the United Nations and top allies like the United Kingdom regard the strikes  as illegal extrajudicial killings . Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has echoed those claims, while other GOP senators have questioned their legality as well. The administration has also declined to publicly detail its legal justification, even as the Justice Department has produced a  classified legal opinion  authorizing the strikes. It has released survivors of the strikes who, if they had been kept in US custody, could have  forced it to defend itself in court . Also, a top commander who CNN has reported  raised questions about the legality of the strikes  is now retiring early.\n \n\n   \n  There is a very real question about whether the servicemembers involved in those strikes are carrying out illegal orders. And the administration has proactively avoided a more robust legal process that could settle that question.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s hardly all. Here are some other key data points:\n \n\n   \n  It’s certainly provocative for Democrats to raise this issue like they have. But it’s not as if they’ve conjured it out of thin air.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/settlers-set-fire-to-cars-in-latest-west-bank-arson-as-israeli-pm-convenes-meeting-about-settler-violence-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00Z","title":"Israeli settlers torch scrapyard in West Bank arson attack as Netanyahu calls meeting on rising extremist violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli settlers set fire to over 150 vehicles at a scrapyard in Huwara, a Palestinian town in the West Bank, in a violent act of arson that occurred on November 20, 2025.

\n  Israeli settlers set fire to cars in the latest arson in the occupied West Bank as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a security meeting on settler violence.\n \n\n   \n  According to witnesses and WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, settlers torched a vehicle scrapyard in the town of Huwara in the northern West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military said its soldiers were dispatched to Huwara after receiving reports of Israeli civilians throwing rocks toward Palestinian vehicles, setting fire and damaging property.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows numerous cars on fire as firefighters try to extinguish the blaze. Thick, black smoke pours into the night sky from the fire that appears to spread over a sizable area.\n \n\n   \n  Mohammed Dalal, who owns the scrapyard, says more than a dozen settlers descended on the site, smashing cars and starting the fire. He says no one was in the scrapyard at the time, but he estimated that 150 cars were torched or damaged.\n \n\n   \n  “I have children in university, I have grandchildren, I have a family; we all depend on this scrapyard,” Dalal told CNN. “Like many Palestinians, I have olive trees, but I haven’t been able to harvest my olives and so this is our only source of income. All I can do is ask God to compensate us.”\n \n\n   \n  The attack happened the same evening Netanyahu convened a security meeting on settler violence in the West Bank, according to two Israeli officials, which has surged in recent weeks and months.

On Monday in a rare condemnation of settler violence, Netanyahu said the attacks were being carried out by “a small, extremist group.”\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Defense Minister Israel Katz declared that Israel will no longer use administrative detention against Israeli settlers, preventing the country’s security apparatus from using one of its most powerful tools to incarcerate settlers while still employing it widely against Palestinians.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledge that cars had been set on fire in the Palestinian town, not far from the settlement of Yitzhar, which is known for its extremist ideology.

They’re very clear, and it’s time to move on.”\n \n\n   \n  The preponderance of scientific evidence shows that vaccines do not cause autism, Singer said.\n \n\n   \n  “ No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines . This includes vaccine ingredients as well as the body’s response to vaccines,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Paul Offit agrees. In a  post on Substack  on Thursday, Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said scientific studies can “never prove never.”\n \n\n   \n  “If RFK Jr. wanted to be honest with the American public, he would make it clear on the CDC’s website that chicken nuggets also might cause autism, which has never been and will never be disproven,” Offit wrote.\n \n\n   \n  HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday, “We are updating the CDC’s website to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on an episode of his  “Chasing Life” podcast  that he doesn’t think vaccines cause autism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s no medicine that’s 1,000% safe,” Makary said. “And I think we have to remember that with everything. I think the absolutism around some of this stuff creates mistrust. And when we say they’re 1,000% safe and it’s impossible for there to be a single complication of a vaccine, that’s the kind of rhetoric, I think, that doesn’t resonate well. So I think we have be humble and take a very honest approach.”\n \n\n   \n    Studies find no relationship\n \n\n   \n  Other bullets on the updated CDC page say studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have been ignored by health authorities. This too is not true: Studies showing a connection between vaccines and autism have proved to be poorly done or were fraudulent. There are, however, many well-done, credible studies that find no such relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One of the  largest studies  looking at this question was published in 2019. Researchers in Denmark enrolled more than 650,000 children born between 1999 and 2011 and followed them from the time they were 1 year of age until the end of August 2013. Roughly 6,500 children were diagnosed with autism during the study period.\n \n\n   \n  When the researchers compared those who received the MMR vaccine with those who did not, they found no significant difference in the risk of developing autism. That held true whether the kids got other vaccines, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine; whether they had siblings with autism; or a host of other factors, such as whether certain kids might be prone to developing a form of regressive autism after getting their shots.\n \n\n   \n  “This study strongly supports that MMR vaccine does not increase the risk for autism,” the authors wrote in the conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  This study is not cited on the CDC’s updated “state of the evidence” on MMR vaccines, however. Instead, it mentions older evidence reviews and raises questions about aluminum, an ingredient added to some vaccines to boost their protection.\n \n\n   \n  The new CDC updates do mention another recent Danish study, published in 2025, which found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of 50 disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. But instead of accepting the overall conclusion of the study, the new CDC page tries to cast doubt on it by homing in on details of data in a supplementary table, saying the findings and other “warrant further investigation” into aluminum exposure and chronic diseases.\n \n\n   \n  The CDC page also says the US Department of Health and Human Services has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\n \n\n   \n  Singer said this is a waste of valuable research money and a distraction from strong science showing that most cases of autism can be traced to genes that affect a baby’s brain development.\n \n\n   \n  The main heading  on the page  states that “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but it has an asterisk that directs readers to a footnote: “The header ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.”\n \n\n   \n  The footnote seems to refer to a commitment by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and Republican from Louisiana,  during his confirmation process  that language on the CDC website “pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism” would not be removed. Cassidy described the promise in a speech in which he explained his support for Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy told CNN on Thursday that he had spoken with Kennedy.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted on X on Thursday, Cassidy said, “I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Dangerous health disinformation’\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Peter Hotez, who is director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and wrote a book called “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism” about his daughter’s diagnosis, said the updated information on the CDC’s page follows a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve decided they want to prove vaccines cause autism. So they keep making a series of assertions,” Hotez said, going back to debunked research that claimed the MMR vaccines caused autism and a retracted 2005 Rolling Stone article by Kennedy that asserted the preservative thimerosal caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  There have also been claims that aluminum in vaccines was a cause of autism, and those have been disproved, Hotez said.\n \n\n   \n  Hotez says the updates to the CDC’s page are “pure garbage.”\n \n\n   \n  “I consider it a piece of dangerous health disinformation, and it needs to be removed right away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on social media late Wednesday that the changes are “a national embarrassment.”\n \n\n   \n  “The weaponization of the voice of CDC is getting worse. This is a public health emergency,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Daskalakis said the agency’s scientists were completely blindsided by the page update.\n \n\n   \n  “This distortion of science under the CDC moniker is the reason I resigned with my colleagues,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than restoring trust in America’s health agencies, moves like this have undermined it, said Dr. Sean O’ Leary, a pediatrician who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear that it’s going to lead to fewer children being vaccinated, children suffering from diseases they didn’t need to suffer from,” O’Leary said.\n \n\n   \n  This is the latest move by the Trump administration to alter longstanding US vaccine policy and practice and cast doubt on vaccinations.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy has hired longtime anti-vax allies – including David Geier, a discredited researcher who was  once disciplined  by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license, and Lyn Redwood, a nurse who was president of the World Mercury Project, which later became Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group Kennedy ran before campaigning for office – to undertake new evaluations of government data in an effort to prove conspiracy theories that hazards of vaccines have long been hidden from the public.\n \n\n   \n  The rate of routine childhood vaccinations has dropped in the United States, allowing preventable diseases including measles and whooping cough to surge. In a call with state health officials Monday, the CDC disease detectives leading the measles response suggested that the US status as a country that has eliminated continuous measles spread was in jeopardy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/north-korea-operatives-fake-job-portal-ai-firms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:18:00Z","title":"North Korean operatives running fake job portal targeting US AI firms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korean operatives have launched a sophisticated cyber operation by creating a fake job portal that mimics the legitimate platform Lever to target applicants of U.S. artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency firms.

CNN\n \n   \n  North Korean operatives created a fake job-application platform targeting applicants to major US artificial intelligence and crypto firms as part of a new effort to steal money and know-how for the Kim Jong Un regime,  researchers said  on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a twist on a yearslong campaign to infiltrate Fortune 500 companies: Instead of simply impersonating employees of those companies,  North Korean  tech workers are now working to gain long-term access to the computers of applicants before they join a company, according to security firm Validin, which discovered the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  “Going after job seekers gives North Korean actors a huge advantage. Instead of trying to slip past an employer’s defenses, they take over the entire hiring process and make it feel completely legitimate to individuals,” Validin’s chief executive Kenneth Kinion told CNN. “People assume they’re doing a normal coding test or following steps for a promising job opportunity, so they’re far more likely to run whatever the interviewer sends them.”\n \n\n   \n  The fake jobs platform mimics the style and substance of Lever, a headhunting platform that boasts tens of thousands of customers. Among the fictional jobs advertised on the North Korean-built platform are a “product manager” related to Claude, the popular AI model developed by San Francisco-based firm Anthropic.\n \n\n   \n  Anthropic’s technology is in high demand. The firm committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft’s compute capacity to expand the use of Claude, Microsoft announced this week.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from Lever, Anthropic and all the other companies impersonated in the scheme. The North Korean diplomatic mission in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Because many candidates don’t want their current employer to know they’re looking elsewhere, they’re less likely to report anything suspicious, making it even easier for the attackers to slip through unnoticed,” Kinion said.\n \n\n   \n  Kinion, whose team discovered the fake job portal this week, said he wasn’t aware of anyone who has fallen victim to the scheme yet, but many have fallen for past industrial espionage campaigns tied to Pyongyang.\n \n\n   \n  For years, North Korean workers have used fraudulent identities and sometimes passed interview screenings to infiltrate American companies big and small. The workers then send the money back to Pyongyang to support the regime’s rogue weapons program, according to private experts and US officials.\n \n\n   \n  A previous CNN  investigation  showed how the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korean hackers have also  stolen billions of dollars  from banks and cryptocurrency firms over the last several years, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. A White House official  estimated  in 2023 that half of  North Korea’s  missile program had been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft.\n \n\n   \n  A series of US indictments and sanctions has raised awareness of the insider IT worker threat. Pyongyang has evolved its tactics in response, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  “These operators appear to hold elevated privileges, far beyond what a standard IT worker receives, which is evident from their more malicious activities,” Michael Barnhart, a North Korea-focused researcher at insider threat firm DTEX Systems, told CNN. “This reinforces the notion that these activities are part of a broader, well-integrated ecosystem within North Korea’s cyber operations.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/nigeria-christians-trump-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00Z","title":"Nigerian Officials Meet US Officials Amid Trump’s Threats of Military Action Over Violence Against Christians","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nigerian officials, led by National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, are holding high-level diplomatic meetings with key US officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau in response to President Donald Trump’s designation of Nigeria as a country of particular concern due to perceived threats to Christians.

Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat, and it could begin the week of Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/brian-walshe-guilty-plea-legal-defense","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Brian Walshe Pleads Guilty to Body Disposal, Faces Murder Trial","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, a Massachusetts man, pleaded guilty to misleading police and the illegal disposal of his wife Ana Walshe’s body after she vanished in early 2023, but he has not admitted to murdering her.

Here’s what that could mean for his murder trial \n       \n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:44 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man on trial for murdering his wife in 2023 admitted this week that he disposed of her body in dumpsters and misled police, but his lawyers insist he is not admitting to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with the court having chosen the jury that will consider the murder charge still haunting him, the question becomes: How will  Brian Walshe’s  legal team defend him?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, minutes before jury selection was set to begin for his murder trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife, Ana Walshe. The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection was completed on Thursday.  CNN affiliate WCVB  reported 16 panelists had been chosen, 12 of whom will decide the case. The other four will be alternates.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-democrats-seditious-behavior","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump accuses Democratic lawmakers who urged military to disobey illegal orders of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump accused Democratic lawmakers who urged military and intelligence personnel to disobey illegal orders of engaging in 'seditious behavior, punishable by death,' sparking immediate backlash from both Democratic and Republican leaders.

Trump accuses Democratic lawmakers who urged military to disobey illegal orders of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’ \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Arlette Saenz, Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Thursday suggested that Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials  to disobey illegal orders  should be put to death, sparking an outcry among Democrats on Capitol Hill that the president was seeking to incite violence.\n \n\n   \n  “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, responding to a video from half a dozen members of Congress who previously served in the military and intelligence community urging people currently in those roles to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote. He also reposted several other users’ posts, including one that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”\n \n\n   \n  The comments drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who condemned Trump’s comments as an attempt to incite violence, and even drew the scrutiny of members in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally who served as a lawyer for the military reserves, said the president’s remarks were “over the top,” though he also said he considered the Democrats’ video “despicable.” And GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he didn’t think it was “really a good idea to talk about jailing your political opponents, or hanging them, or whatever else.”\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later denied that Trump was calling for lawmakers to be executed, arguing that the members of Congress with national security backgrounds should not be encouraging anyone to defy orders from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These members knew what they were doing. They were leaning into their credentials, as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander in chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him and you can betray your oath of office,” Leavitt said. “That is a very, very dangerous message. And it perhaps is punishable by law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a joint statement, the six Democratic lawmakers in the video – Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan – vowed they “will not be intimidated.”\n \n\n   \n  “What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the lawmakers said in part.\n \n\n   \n  “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.”\n \n\n   \n  Slotkin was accompanied by USCP officers to an event in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Her team requested the additional presence from USCP for the event that took place off Capitol Hill, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n   “I think when a lion’s share of Americans understand that it is in their own power to push back on this kind of rhetoric and this kind of threat, that’s when we actually turn the tide,” she said at the event.\n \n\n   \n  Deluzio called for both parties to unite against what he called Trump’s “outrageous call for political violence.” “It’s a moment where Democrats and Republicans and everyone else in the country should condemn his calls for political violence,” he said on CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Crow, meanwhile, warned on CNN that Trump’s comments should be taken seriously. “We have to take everything that Donald Trump says seriously. He throws a lot of stuff out there, but some of the things he carries through on,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the comments “an outright threat” and that Trump was “calling for the execution of elected officials.” He added from the Senate floor: “This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his leadership team said they had been in touch with law enforcement authorities to make sure lawmakers were protected.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families. Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the president’s comments, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he didn’t agree with them but dismissed the video that sparked his reaction as “unnecessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t agree with that. Obviously, everyone has their First Amendment rights. But what they did was ill-advised and provocative and unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, similarly called the video “wildly inappropriate,” as he defended Trump. Though he later conceded he wouldn’t have used the same language.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to allow others to make legal judgments about how that…the words that the President chose are not the ones that I would use, OK,” Johnson said Thursday evening.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, I don’t think that this is…these are crimes punishable by death or any of that,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The lawmakers who posted the video that sparked Trump’s reaction did not specify which orders service members received, or might receive, that could be illegal. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said in the video, adding, “Know that we have your back. … Don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the Justice Department will be taking a “very close look” at those lawmakers’ actions, calling it a “disgusting and inappropriate display of supposed leadership from the Democrat Party.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/americas/colombia-holy-grail-shipwreck-san-jose-treasures-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00Z","title":"Colombia recovers first treasures from 300-year-old ‘holy grail of shipwrecks’","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombia has recovered valuable artifacts—including gold, silver, bronze coins, a porcelain cup, and a cannon—from the sunken Spanish galleon San José, which sank in 1708 during the War of the Spanish Succession while transporting colonial riches.

     5:09 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Colombia has recovered gold and bronze coins, a porcelain cup and a cannon from a sunken  Spanish warship  dubbed the “holy grail of shipwrecks.”\n \n\n   \n  The artifacts are the first  treasures  to be recovered from the wreckage of the San José, a Spanish galleon that was sunk by the British Royal Navy in the Caribbean more than 300 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of its sinking, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the San José had been carrying large amounts of gold, silver and emeralds from Spanish colonies in Latin American back to the Spanish king.\n \n\n   \n  Collectively, those treasures are believed to be worth billions of dollars in today’s money and they are at the center of a heated legal dispute between the Colombian government and a US-based marine salvaging company named Sea Search-Armada (SSA).\n \n\n   \n  Colombia maintains that it discovered the San José in 2015 with help from international scientists, but SSA, formerly known as Glocca Morra, claims to have found the shipwreck in the early 1980s and has launched a  legal battle  in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, claiming it is entitled to approximately $10 billion – roughly half the estimated value of the shipwreck’s treasure.\n \n\n   \n  The Colombian government says its recovery of the treasures is part of a research project that could provide clues about Europe’s economic, social and political climate during the early 18th century. It also says the galleon is significant to Colombia’s culture and identity.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Thursday, Colombian Culture Minister Yannai Kadamani Fonrodona described the recovery as a “historic event” that demonstrated the country’s capacity to protect its underwater cultural heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Alhena Caicedo Fernández, director of Colombia’s Institute of Anthropology and History, said it “opens the possibility for citizens to approach, through material evidence, the history of the San José galleon.”\n \n\n   \n  The government says the items, which were recovered using underwater robots, will now undergo a lengthy conservation process at a lab and will be used for archeological research.\n \n\n   \n  Historical records show that the San José was part of a shipping fleet known as the Flota de Tierra Firme.\n \n\n   \n  It was one of several ships in the fleet that left Peru in 1707 carrying a large amount of royal cargo, but records show that it never reached Spain, instead sinking off Colombia following a battle with British forces the following year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/climate/trump-oil-drilling-offshore-california-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00Z","title":"Trump opens parts of Florida, California waters up to offshore oil drilling, breaking decades of precedent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has proposed a five-year offshore drilling plan that would open federal waters off the entire California coastline and in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico near Florida to oil exploration, reversing decades of bans.

Neither state’s waters have been open to new drilling for decades.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s Interior Department released a five-year offshore drilling plan on Thursday that would open up vast parts of California’s coastline to drilling, which hasn’t happened in that state since the late 1960s. The Department is also proposing new oil drilling in parts of the Eastern Gulf — located approximately 100 nautical miles off Florida’s coast — a decision opposed by Florida’s Republican leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s proposal would open the Eastern Gulf to federal oil drilling auctions starting in 2029. It would open auctions for drilling in central and southern California in 2027 and northern California in 2029.\n \n\n   \n  The oil industry has been advocating for opening up parts of the Eastern Gulf that are adjacent to areas where oil production has been happening for decades in the Central Gulf, an industry source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal is sure to be met with resistance in California. The state’s coast has not seen drilling since a devastating oil spill in 1969, which drew national attention for destroying coastal wildlife and the state’s fishing industry.\n \n\n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the plan “idiotic” in a statement and vowed the state “will use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s interesting that Donald’s proposal doesn’t include the waters off Mar-a-Lago,” Newsom said in his statement.\n \n\n   \n  During Trump’s first term, Florida’s congressional delegation — including Republicans — repeatedly pushed back against attempts to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico to drilling. The first Trump administration extended the offshore drilling ban for the Eastern Gulf, rather than opening it up.\n \n\n   \n  This new Gulf action has also rankled many Florida Republicans, where memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill still shape public opinion. Molly Best, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said the governor’s office still supports the ban on drilling in the area from Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The DeSantis administration “urges the Department of Interior to reconsider,” Best said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  And a letter from several Florida Republican congressmen to the president urged the administration to withdraw the Eastern Gulf parcels, saying oil exploration there was “incompatible with military operations and recreational uses.” Among the signees is Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed candidate for governor in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Leading up to the release of Thursday’s five-year plan, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said he   believed he had assurances from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that any new drilling in the Gulf would not threaten Florida economically, environmentally or militarily, a source with knowledge of their conversation told CNN. A source close to several Republicans in Florida’s delegation told CNN officials believe the proposal honors those assurances, though congressional staff were still studying the details.\n \n\n   \n  National Ocean Industries Association president Erik Milito called the inclusion of the Eastern Gulf a “forward-looking approach” and American Petroleum Institute president Mike Sommers hailed it as a “historic step.”\n \n\n   \n  The move is part of President Donald Trump’s agenda to open up more parts of the country to drilling for fossil fuels — the oft-repeated campaign promise of “drill, baby, drill.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s plan also proposes holding lease sales in the western and central Gulf of Mexico, where the vast majority of offshore drilling currently takes place. It also proposes auctioning off federal waters along almost all of Alaska’s coastline at the end of the decade and into the early 2030s.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Trump administration’s new plan, California leaders vowed to push back on the federal government’s move to open waters up to drilling, including possible legal action.\n \n\n   \n  “Time and again, President Trump has shown that his interest lies with his Big Oil friends profiting at the expense of our environment and public health,” said Christine Lee, a spokesperson for California attorney general Rob Bonta. “We won’t stand for this and are exploring our legal options.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Jared Huffman, both California Democrats, said in a joint statement that Trump’s plan “targets California and the whole West Coast because they think we will roll over.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are wrong,” Padilla and Huffman said. “We’re going to fight this with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  Given Trump’s tariffs, it’s not currently boom time for oil drilling, experts told CNN. Companies instead are trying to curb their spending and hold onto their earnings, said Tom Seng, a professor of energy finance at Texas Christian University.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the industry doesn’t have a lot going on,” Seng told CNN. “We certainly have a pro-fossil fuel administration. They’re going to streamline things for us, but the marketplace will always dictate activity.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Seng said, some oil exploration companies will likely want to “take advantage of the lease offerings,” with an eye towards the long-term future.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, when will they deploy the capital to actually drill on the leases?” he said. “There won’t be a rush to do so. $60 oil won’t help.”\n \n\n   \n  Environmental groups said the plan would pose a threat to marine life and oceanside communities around the country.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft plan is an oil spill nightmare,” said Oceana campaign director Joseph Gordon. “The last thing America needs now is a massive expansion of offshore drilling that could shut down our shores with catastrophic oil spills.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken in recent days and weeks to expand oil drilling around the country. The Interior Department this week announced it was rolling back a Biden-era rule that had banned fossil fuel drilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, over 13 million acres.\n \n\n   \n  And environmental groups sounded the alarm as oil company ConocoPhillips proposed more oil drilling exploration in Alaska, including drilling four new exploratory wells in the NPRA. The company is currently developing the massive Willow project in NPRA where it expects to start producing oil by 2029. Willow was approved by former President Joe Biden in a move that roiled the Democratic president’s base.\n \n\n   \n  “The public deserves the right to have a say on what happens on these critically important public lands in the Western Arctic,” Earthjustice attorney Ian Dooley said in a recent statement. “Seismic and drilling activities can cause impacts on this sensitive ecosystem that lasts decades.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/illinois-immigrants-release-blocked","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00Z","title":"Appeals Court Blocks Release of Hundreds of Migrants Arrested in Illinois Just a Day Before They Could Have Left Detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal appeals court in the 7th Circuit blocked the release of hundreds of migrants arrested during Operation Midway Blitz, a DHS-led immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago area from June to October 2025.

paused the  release of hundreds of immigrants  who were arrested during the Department of Homeland Security’s aggressive immigration actions in the Chicago area earlier this year, according to a court filing Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Last Wednesday, US District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the Trump administration to release on $1,500 bond hundreds of detainees after he determined the arrests violated a local consent decree barring warrantless arrests of immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  Court records showed last Friday the Department of Justice submitted a list of more than 600 people to be assessed for release. The list showed only a fraction of those detained were considered “high risk” by federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  The list included criminal histories for just 16 defendants. Those criminal histories included convictions or arrests for aggravated assault, driving under the influence, indecent exposure, battery and enticement of a minor and kidnapping.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of the DOJ filing showed migrants arrested in the Chicago area were transferred to detention facilities as far away as Texas and Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday sided with the Trump administration to keep those on the list in custody, just one day before detainees were set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions between the Trump administration and local leaders, protesters and journalists in Chicago and Illinois have boiled over since Operation Midway Blitz got underway over the summer. The government is fighting a multi-front legal battle as groups challenge agents’  use of force  on demonstrators, treatment of media and clergy, and warrantless detentions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal immigration crackdown has drawn pushback from community members concerned about the potential for racial profiling and  constitutional rights  violations – for both documented and undocumented people – as  the mass deportation agenda  has swept up people of all ages, from  children  and  families  to  suspected criminals , by making arrests at  Home Depots  and farms, outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  In its request to pause the release of migrants, the Trump administration argued Judge Cummings’ orders in the case incorrectly interpreted the law, exceeded the scope of the consent decree and the court’s “legal and equitable authority” and infringed upon the immigration officers’ ability to operate.\n \n\n   \n  Though the appeals court did not explain why it sided with the Trump administration in the detention case, its decision comes just a day after a three-judge panel with the 7th Circuit blocked  a different judge’s order  because they believed the judge had overstepped their authority by imposing strict limits on how federal agents could operate in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In that ongoing case, US District Judge Sara Ellis responded to concerns from demonstrators, clergy and media about federal agents’ escalating crowd-control methods. Ellis prohibited agents from using several types of force, issued detailed requirements for body cameras and identification, and ordered the government to produce reams of internal records.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis called the Trump administration’s claims of rampant violence and obstruction in Chicago “not credible” in a written order released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants would have people believe instead that the Chicagoland area is in a vise hold of violence, ransacked by rioters, and attacked by agitators – which justifies the unprecedented swath of indiscriminate uses of force unleashed on journalists, peaceful protestors, and religious practitioners. That narrative simply is untrue.”\n \n\n   \n  Both cases under judges Cummings and Ellis are still ongoing. The 7th Circuit will hear oral arguments in the case on migrant detentions on December 2.\n \n\n   \n  The National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, the lead attorneys in the class-action lawsuit, said they are “deeply disappointed” by Thursday’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The Seventh Circuit stay means that Chicago-area families will face, at minimum, weeks more separation, and people will continue to languish in inhumane immigrant detention centers, at risk of deportation without due process. This is especially sad given that families already have been separated from loved ones for weeks,” the organizations said in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  Even after Judge Cummings’ order paved the way for detainees’ release, the fate of those in custody remained unclear. Several of those arrested had filed their own individual cases, and some, according to the DOJ filing, were already released.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, according to Cummings’ ruling. The judge had ordered that those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple attorneys CNN spoke with were unsure how Cummings’ ruling would impact their clients who were transferred out of Judge Cummings’ jurisdiction.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:12:00Z","title":"Child Missing After Cross-Country Trip; Mother's Uncooperative Stance Sparks Investigation","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after being last seen with her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, during a cross-country road trip from Lompoc, California, to Nebraska.

What may happen next? \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:12 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after she was last seen with her mother wearing wigs on a cross-country road trip.\n \n\n   \n  The mother, Ashlee Buzzard, returned to their California home without Melodee, did not report her daughter missing and has declined to cooperate with law enforcement, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI has joined in the search for Melodee, and the case has drawn  widespread attention  well outside of Southern California. In all, the set of circumstances has raised serious red flags about Melodee’s well-being and about potential criminal wrongdoing for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Still, investigators have not charged Buzzard with a crime related to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  So, what gives?\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just not, ‘A kid’s missing. They haven’t been seen. Let’s arrest the mother,’” CNN legal analyst  Joey Jackson  said of how law enforcement operates. “What are the specific factual circumstances that would make the mother responsible?”\n \n\n   \n  “In any case, you need probable cause,” he added. “Is there reason to believe that a crime was committed and the subject of the person being arrested committed it?”\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke to several legal experts and re-examined other high-profile missing children cases to better understand the potential path forward in Melodee’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office, with assistance from the FBI, has been searching for Melodee and has publicly released some information from the “critical” time period of the road trip from October 7 to 10. Still, investigators may have more evidence that has not been released to the public, making it difficult to speculate on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re waiting for is evidence if she should be charged, and if so, with what,” Los Angeles’ Loyola Law School Professor  Laurie Levenson  said. “This one is still kind of a mystery. We know something is amiss: All of the wigs, the travel, the concerns that people are showing. I think those are legitimate that something is amiss, but we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Melodee went missing last month\n \n\n   \n  The search for Melodee began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the girl had been absent for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found, officials said. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts and “has been uncooperative” with investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts has focused on her and her mother’s movements during a 1,000-mile road trip from their home in Lompoc, California, to Nebraska. On October 7, Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from a rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing wigs on October 7, the sheriff’s office said. Further, the rental car’s license plate was changed midway through the trip in what the sheriff’s office said is believed to be an attempt “to avoid detection.”\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said in a November 6 statement . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  On November 7, the sheriff’s office  announced  the mother was arrested on a felony false imprisonment charge for allegedly using a box cutter and preventing an adult man “from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  She pleaded not guilty and was released from custody with GPS monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  The charge was dismissed and her pre-trial supervision ended on Thursday after the judge did not find sufficient probable cause, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office told CNN. The hearing featured testimony from the accuser, according to  CNN affiliate KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard’s attorney, Adrian Galvan, declined to comment to CNN about the investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday night Ashlee Buzzard was “in consistent contact with investigators and they have not had any additional information that they are prepared to release.”\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when the girl was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n    The next steps in the investigation\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are likely to continue tracing the steps of the road trip as they search for physical evidence, digital communications and witnesses, legal experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is what they should be doing,” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller explained. “They are taking their time. They are being meticulous. They are building the pieces of a case that may come together if and when they do have evidence to arrest her.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Buzzard, her uncooperative stance may be frustrating for investigators, but the Fifth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to silence in an interrogation.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no legal imperative at all, under any circumstance, no matter how bad things might look for you in public opinion, for you to say anything,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Other missing children cases\n \n\n   \n  In two high-profile cases involving missing children, the parents were initially charged with lesser counts as investigators continued to search for more evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Florida mother  Casey Anthony , for one, was initially charged with child neglect, providing false statements to police and obstruction in July 2008 in the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter  Caylee Anthony . The child had last been seen a month earlier and was reported missing by her grandparents.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, in October of that year, Anthony was indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The decomposed body of her daughter was found in December 2008.\n \n\n   \n  A jury ultimately acquitted her of murder but convicted her on four counts of providing false information to police.\n \n\n   \n  Or consider the case of the Idaho mother  Lori Vallow Daybell .\n \n\n   \n  Her children, JJ and Tylee, were last seen in September 2019, and relatives raised concerns about their whereabouts two months later. In  February 2020 , Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.\n \n\n   \n  The children’s bodies were found in June 2020, and Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were then indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Both were later  convicted  of  murder  in the children’s deaths.\n \n\n   \n  How Melodee’s case will play out remains a mystery.   In the near term, investigators’ focus will remain on finding her and her well-being.\n \n\n   \n  “There are so many open questions at this point,” Levenson said. “Right now, I think the priority is probably less the charges and more finding the kid.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/state-department-freedom-speech-human-rights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"State Department to Focus on Freedom of Speech in Next Human Rights Report, Likely Targeting European Governments","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. State Department is shifting its focus in the upcoming human rights report to freedom of speech and 'natural rights,' particularly targeting Western European countries like the UK, France, and Germany for alleged restrictions on free expression.

reported the 9-year-old had been absent for a prolonged time.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into her whereabouts has now stretched for nearly a month, focusing on a 1,000-mile road trip from California to Nebraska and closely examining the actions of her “uncooperative” mother, Ashlee Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard was initially charged with a felony in an incident involving an unrelated different person, but the charge has since been dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a closer look at the timeline of the child’s disappearance and the search for her.\n \n\n   \n    Mother-daughter life in SoCal\n \n\n   \n  Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard lived in a home on Mars Avenue in Lompoc, California, about an hour’s drive west of Santa Barbara.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when she was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most recent photos of Melodee was from 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee participated in the Lompoc Unified School District’s remote study program and was seen in  August 2025 , according to the  Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office .\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office described her as about 4-feet-6-inches tall, 60 pounds, with brown curly hair and brown eyes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘critical’ road trip\n \n\n   \n  On  October 7 , Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing what appeared to be wigs on  October 7 , the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle’s travel route spanned as far as Nebraska, and the return route detoured into Kansas. It is unclear when the car began to head back west.\n \n\n   \n  During the journey, the license plate on the Malibu, which was originally a California plate (9MNG101), appears to change. The car was seen with a New York license plate (HCG9677) beginning  October 8 . “The plate does not belong to the vehicle or Buzzard and is believed to have been used as a false or switched plate to avoid detection,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Per the sheriff’s office, on  October 9 , the Chevy Malibu traveled through cities in at least four states, including Green River, Utah; Panguitch, Utah; Northwest Arizona; Primm, Nevada; and Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n \n\n   \n  On  October 9 , surveillance footage captured Melodee in an area near the Colorado–Utah state line on the return trip, the last confirmed sighting of her.\n \n\n   \n  The next day, the Malibu was returned to the Lompoc rental agency with its original California plates.\n \n\n   \n    The investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on  October 14  by Lompoc school administrators, who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in. The sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts, the  sheriff’s office said .\n \n\n   \n  Ashlee Buzzard “has been uncooperative with investigators,” the  sheriff’s office said  on  October 17 .\n \n\n   \n  The FBI joined the investigation on  October 18 .\n \n\n   \n  With public interest growing, the  sheriff’s office  on  October 20  asked the public “not to attempt to conduct their own searches or investigations. While well-intentioned, these efforts could unintentionally interfere with investigative work already in progress.”\n \n\n   \n  On  October 22 ,  investigators released  to the public a timeline of Melodee’s movements, and on  October 24 , they  released  surveillance images of her at the rental car agency.\n \n\n   \n  Members of Melodee’s father’s side of the family held a candlelight vigil for the missing girl on  October 24 , according to  KSBY .\n \n\n   \n  On  October 30 ,  investigators served  follow-up search warrants at the Buzzard home, a storage locker and the rental car.\n \n\n   \n  Further,  investigators released  on  November 6  a short video of Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard at the rental agency weeks earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest and dismissal of false imprisonment charge\n \n\n   \n  On  November 7 , the sheriff’s office  announced  they had arrested Ashlee Buzzard on a false imprisonment charge unrelated to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they learned of an incident a day earlier in which the mother “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.” Buzzard faced a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the false imprisonment case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house on  November 6  to offer help finding Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  “[D]uring an interaction at her residence, the situation escalated. Ms. Buzzard became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing,” the man wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “A box cutter was produced, and despite multiple requests to be allowed to exit the home, I was not immediately permitted to leave. The door was secured by several locks, which delayed my ability to exit. This incident was reported to law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard appeared in court  November 12  and pleaded not guilty to the false imprisonment charge.\n \n\n   \n  Her defense attorney Adrian Galvan argued she was not a flight risk, but prosecutors disagreed, noting her use of wigs and the license plate swaps during her road trip with Melodee last month.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent that she has taken lengths to conceal her identity and whereabouts on other occasions, and if she were to be released, that would be a concern,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor mentioned the presence of a box cutter but did not provide a detailed account of the alleged incident.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Buzzard be released on GPS monitoring with a no-contact order for the victim.\n \n\n   \n  At a pretrial hearing  November 20 , the judge did not find sufficient probable cause and dismissed the charge and the pre-trial supervision, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The hearing featured testimony from the accuser who said he felt threatened by Buzzard when he visited her home on November 6,  KSBY reported . The judge ruled to dismiss the complaint, saying an audio rexcording of their conversation did not show enough evidence for the accuser to have been in fear, according to KSBY.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/travel/real-id-tsa-fee","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"15:56:00-05:00","title":"Travelers without a REAL ID could be charged $18 by TSA under proposed rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has proposed a $18 fee for travelers without a REAL ID to use airport checkpoints, as part of the implementation of federal security standards established under the REAL ID Act of 2005.

The administration has claimed that the National Guards presence added significant preventative measure that helped decrease crime in the district.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump is well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington, DC, to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement with specific tasks,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in response to the ruling. “This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC.”\n \n\n   \n  In her ruling, Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, acknowledged the complexities of the case given “the unique constitutional position of the District of Columbia.”\n \n\n   \n  Cobb, however, said that “at its core, Congress has given the District rights to govern itself. Those rights are infringed upon when Defendants approve, in excess of their statutory authority, the deployment of National Guard troops to the District.”\n \n\n   \n  “From the beginning, we made clear that the U.S. military should not be policing American citizens on American soil,” DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement following the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “This unprecedented federal overreach is not normal, or legal,” he added. “It is long past time to let the National Guard go home – to their everyday lives, their regular jobs, their families, and their children.”\n \n\n   \n  Cobb found that “the deployments at issue entail the day-to-day presence of more than 2,000 National Guard troops,” which the judge noted is about two-thirds the size of the local police force.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court finds no authority in Title 49 of the D.C.

She did that while being a full-time student.”\n \n\n   \n  “Under the law, she is presumed innocent and reserves all of her defenses for presentation in a court of law,” Louis Barbone added.\n \n\n   \n  When law enforcement officers responded to the scene along a trail in a nature preserve, they found Greene “in a wooded area,” crying and screaming with her hands and feet bound with zip ties, and dozens of cuts on her body, including her face and chest, according to court documents. Two messages were written in black marker on her body: “TRUMP WHORE” on her stomach and Van Drew “IS RACIST” on her back.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said in the complaint that Greene claimed the men who allegedly attacked her said they had a gun and “threatened to shoot her.” She told authorities she was held down while the men cut her and wrote on her body.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department said the investigation revealed that Greene had paid “a body modification/scarification artist” to make the cuts to her body before the staged attack.\n \n\n   \n  FBI agents went to the artist’s studio, and according to the complaint, obtained a receipt showing Greene had paid $500 for the cuts to be made on her body.\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement officers also found zip ties similar to the ones used to bind Greene’s hands and feet, in her car, court documents said. Her co-conspirator’s phone had also been used to search “zip ties near me” two days before the incident, the Justice Department said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply saddened by today’s news, and while Natalie is no longer associated with the Congressman’s government office, our thoughts and prayers are with her,” Van Drew’s office said in a statement. “We hope she’s getting the care she needs.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene now faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty on both charges. She made her first court appearance on Wednesday and was released on $200,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with a statement from Greene’s attorney.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/ups-plane-crash-ntsb-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:40:00Z","title":"NTSB Releases Frame-by-Frame Images of Engine Separating During Deadly UPS Crash in Louisville","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reveals that a fatigue crack in the engine mount of the left engine on UPS Flight 2976 caused it to separate from the McDonnell Douglas MD-11F aircraft just after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.

UPS has 26 other MD-11s in their fleet, a company spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The engine and other faulty parts\n \n\n   \n  Investigators who combed the runway shortly after the crash said they recovered and cleaned hardware from the scene—a pair structural fittings which kept the engine pylon snug to the wing. The fittings—known as lugs—showed signs of fatigue cracking and over-stressing, evidenced by “their 2 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions,” investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The report also lays out a new timeline of the crash sequence along with new data which showed the plane failed to climb higher than 30 feet above Runway 17 Right at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  A witness in the control tower reported the takeoff speed appeared normal for the type of aircraft, but the climb was not. Another witness said the plane stopped climbing and began to lose altitude before rolling to the left, the preliminary report said.\n \n\n   \n  The MD-11 is equipped with three engines: one on each wing and one on the tail. The plane went through some previous maintenance in San Antonio that put it out of commission for six weeks, investigators said. All service records will be reviewed.\n \n\n   \n  The left and right engines of the plane are attached to the underside of pylons that are attached to each wing.\n \n\n   \n    Investigators are still gathering more information\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have also been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigators said.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorder contained two hours and four minutes of “good quality digitally recorded audio,” Inman previously said. The flight data recorder contained 63 hours of data that spanned over 24 flights, including the accident, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  In a rare move, the NTSB drew a parallel to a previous disaster—the 1979 crash of American Airlines Flight 191, in Chicago which killed 271 on board and two on the ground. The plane involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the forerunner to the MD-11.\n \n\n   \n  During that plane’s takeoff rotation, the left engine, pylon assembly and about three feet of the leading edge of the left wing separated from the plane and fell onto the runway. The plane rolled to the left and crashed.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple specialists in varying factors were deployed to investigate including experts   in air traffic control, human performance, aircraft performance and more.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the 12-pages of new findings were published just more than two weeks since the November 4 crash, significantly faster than the NTSB’s typical 30-day timeline to put out a preliminary report.\n \n\n   \n  “We appreciate the National Transportation Safety Board’s prompt release of preliminary findings and will fully support the investigation through its conclusion,” UPS said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Boeing, which long ago merged with the planes original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, said, “We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB.

\n  The  United Kingdom  did “too little, too late,” in its early response to the coronavirus pandemic, leading to thousands of more deaths, the head of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry said as its latest findings were released.\n \n\n   \n  “The initial response to the pandemic was marked by a lack of information and a lack of urgency,” the inquiry’s report said, adding that “despite clear signs that the virus was spreading globally, all four nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) failed to take sufficiently timely and effective action.”\n \n\n   \n  If the UK government had introduced restrictions earlier, when the number of Covid cases was lower, mandatory lockdown could have either been shorter or avoided all together, it added.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, “this lack of urgency and the huge rise in infections made a mandatory lockdown inevitable.”\n \n\n   \n  “They had no choice by then. But, it was through their own acts and omissions that they had no choice,” said Baroness Heather Hallett, the inquiry’s chair.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, if the lockdown – which began on March 23, 2020 – had been introduced just a week earlier, at least 23,000 people would have survived, according to the report.\n \n\n   \n  “The evidence suggests that the number of deaths in England alone in the first wave up until the 1st of July 2020, would have been reduced by 48%,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report, the second of 10 areas of investigation for the inquiry, was focused on how political leaders and senior officials made decisions during the pandemic. It examined the core machinery of government, the role of scientific advice, and the relationship between Westminster and the devolved nations as the crisis unfolded.\n \n\n   \n  Calling February 2020 a “lost month,” Hallett said: “The obviously escalating crisis required leadership from the very top. All four governments knew that in the reasonable worst case scenario, up to 80% of the population would be infected, with a very significant loss of life.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, rule-breaking politicians and their advisers weakened public confidence in government decisions and increased the likelihood that people would ignore restrictions, the report said, faulting all four UK nations for poor planning and decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  It said that strained relations and low trust between former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland made coordination difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s response throughout the crisis was criticized by many who said that he wasn’t taking the pandemic seriously enough.   The so-called “ Partygate ” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday, contributed to his departure as prime minister in July 2022.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a toxic and chaotic culture at the heart of the UK government …this kind of culture is detrimental to good decision making,” Hallett said.\n \n\n   \n  Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, which campaigned for an independent inquiry, said in a Thursday  statement  that “while it is vindicating to see Boris Johnson blamed in black and white for the catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic, it is devastating to think of the lives that could have been saved under a different prime minister.”\n \n\n   \n  “To make mistakes is human. To refuse to listen to frontline workers, vulnerable people, the insights of devolved leaders or scientific experts is unforgivable,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The report said that children were not given sufficient priority, as ministers did not fully account for the consequences of closing school and that overall, lockdown caused lasting societal harm and heightened existing inequalities.\n \n\n   \n  It did commend ministers for a successful vaccine rollout and for managing the exit from lockdown in early 2021 in a way that protected vulnerable groups.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s report follows the inquiry’s initial report, published in July 2024, which delivered a stark assessment of the country’s pandemic preparedness.\n \n\n   \n  That report concluded that the UK entered the pandemic with “fatal strategic flaws” embedded in its emergency planning systems and found that government preparedness was focused almost entirely on influenza rather than respiratory viruses like Covid-19, despite international warnings.\n \n\n   \n  This narrow scenario planning meant that essential protections, such as robust PPE stockpiles, effective surveillance, and diverse expert input were all inadequate once the pandemic began, it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ten recommendations were issued, including a statutory body for emergency preparedness, regular national pandemic exercises, simplified crisis structures, and significantly improved data systems.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/science/universe-expansion-slow-down-dark-energy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:48:00Z","title":"Are astronomers wrong about dark energy?

New study casts doubt on universe’s accelerating expansion \n       \n  By Jacopo Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:48 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The universe’s expansion might not be accelerating but slowing down, a new study suggests.\n \n\n   \n   If confirmed, the finding would upend decades of established astronomical assumptions and rewrite our understanding of dark energy, the elusive force that counters the inward pull of gravity in our universe.\n \n\n   \n  Two separate teams of astronomers, while observing bright, exploding stars called Type 1a supernovas, put forth the idea in 1998   that dark energy might enable the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists had   noted that some of the most distant supernovas were dimmer than expected and concluded that they had moved away from Earth faster than anticipated. The discovery won them a  Nobel Prize in physics in 2011 .\n \n\n   \n  However, the nature of dark energy has remained a mystery, and its role in the universe’s expansion has been called into question  before .\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a consortium of hundreds of researchers using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)   in Arizona, developed the  largest ever 3D map  of the universe. The observations hinted at the fact that dark energy may be weakening over time, indicating that the universe’s rate of expansion could eventually slow.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a study  published  November 6   in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society provides further evidence that dark energy might not be pushing on the universe with the same strength it used to.\n \n\n   \n  The DESI project’s findings last year represented “a major, major paradigm change … and our result, in some sense, agrees well with that,” said Young-Wook Lee, a professor of astrophysics at Yonsei University in South Korea and lead researcher for the new study.\n \n\n   \n  Lee and his colleagues’ work builds on the evolving understanding of dark energy, suggesting that the universe’s expansion has already started to slow down — something that could alter the fate of the universe itself. “Dark energy is there, but the present universe has already entered a decelerating phase, today,” Lee said. “So the fate of the universe could change. And if you can change the fate of the universe, that is really important progress in cosmology.”\n \n\n   \n    Aging supernovas\n \n\n   \n  To reach their conclusions, the researchers analyzed a sample of 300 galaxies containing Type 1a supernovas and posited that the dimming of distant exploding stars was not only due to their moving farther away from Earth, but also due to the progenitor star’s age.\n \n\n   \n  “Before our work, Type Ia supernovae were thought to explode with nearly identical intrinsic brightness, making them highly reliable ‘standard candles,’” said study coauthor Junhyuk Son, a doctoral candidate of astronomy   at Yonsei University. “However, we found that their luminosity actually depends on the age of the stars that produce them — younger progenitors yield slightly dimmer supernovae, while older ones are brighter.”\n \n\n   \n  Son said the team has a high statistical confidence — 99.99% — about this age-brightness relation,  allowing them to use Type 1a supernovas more accurately than before to assess the universe’s expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “If confirmed, this would represent the most significant shift in cosmology since the discovery of dark energy in 1998,” Son said. “It would suggest that the (expansion of the) universe is no longer accelerating today and that dark energy is not a constant force but something that evolves over time. This discovery would open an entirely new chapter in our understanding of the physical nature of dark energy, how it has changed throughout cosmic history, and what it ultimately means for the fate of the universe.”\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, if the expansion continues to slow down, the universe could begin to contract, ending in what astronomers imagine may be the opposite of the big bang — the  big crunch . “That is certainly a possibility,” Lee said. “Even two years ago, the Big Crunch was out of the question. But we need more work to see whether it could actually happen.”\n \n\n   \n    Extraordinary claims\n \n\n   \n  The new research proposes a radical revision of accepted knowledge, so, understandably, it is being met with skepticism.\n \n\n   \n  ”This study rests on a flawed premise,” Adam Riess, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University and one of the recipients of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics, said in an email. “It suggests supernovae have aged with the Universe, yet observations show the opposite — today’s supernovae occur where young stars form. The same idea was proposed years ago and refuted then, and there appears to be nothing new in this version.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, however, said Riess’ claim is incorrect. “Even in the present-day Universe, Type Ia supernovae are found just as frequently in old, quiescent elliptical galaxies as in young, star-forming ones — which clearly shows that this comment is mistaken. The so-called paper that ‘refuted’ our earlier result relied on deeply flawed data with enormous uncertainties,” he said, adding that the age-brightness correlation has been independently confirmed by two separate teams in the United States and China.\n \n\n   \n  Other experts in the field who were not involved with the study echoed some of Riess’ concerns. Dan Scolnic, an associate professor of physics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, noted that the study makes a leap from host galaxy age to supernova age that isn’t physically justified. “The authors are proposing ideas that the community has already tested and corrected for with much larger data sets. The universe is still accelerating just fine,” Scolnic said.\n \n\n   \n  Dillon Brout, an assistant professor in the departments of astronomy and physics of Boston University, pointed out via email that the paper raises a fair question about how the ages of supernova progenitors change over cosmic time, adding that it is always important to challenge our way of thinking in order to a better understand of the universe. “However, the way they model that evolution is not supported by observations nor by our understanding of how these systems form. Modern supernova analyses already account for the connection between brightness and the environments where these stars originate, which captures most of the effect they discuss,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Dragan Huterer, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an email, noting that he does not feel the new research “rises to the threshold to overturn the currently favored model.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee is aware that the work might be controversial. “We have a long way to go to convince everyone in the supernova cosmology community,” he said. “There are still many people who are strongly against (our results), so a lot of debate and discussions should happen in the near future.”\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, more clarity on the issue might be around the corner. The new  Vera C. Rubin Observatory , which started operating this year, is set to help settle the debate with the early 2026 launch of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, an ultrawide and ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the universe made by scanning the entire sky every few nights over 10 years to capture a compilation of asteroids and comets, exploding stars, and distant galaxies as they change.\n \n\n   \n  “Vera Rubin will discover more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies with very high-precision age measurement,” Lee said. “It will take three or five years, and it will allow a more direct cosmological test without worrying about this age bias effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dark energy is getting weirder and weirder,” Lee concluded. “But there is no good theory that can explain this very weird behavior. So I think we are missing something. Maybe, in five years, an even more surprising result can come up.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/jd-vance-economy-patience-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"14:16:00Z","title":"Vance pleads for ‘patience’ on the economy in sharp departure from Trump’s rhetoric","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance has shifted the Trump administration’s economic messaging by calling for public patience, acknowledging that affordability issues like rising food prices — including eggs and coffee — remain serious concerns despite Trump’s claims of economic success.

the economy in sharp departure from Trump’s rhetoric \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:16 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance on Thursday acknowledged that the Trump administration faces growing  skepticism over its economic record , issuing a plea for patience ahead of what he predicted would be an eventual “economic boom.”\n \n\n   \n  “We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do,” Vance said during a Breitbart News event. “As much progress as we’ve made, it’s going to take a little time for Americans to feel that.”\n \n\n   \n  The conciliatory tone represented a sharply different approach from the one taken in recent weeks by President Donald Trump, who has  continued to insist  that the economy is thriving while dismissing cost-of-living concerns as little more than a Democratic talking point.\n \n\n   \n  It also underscored the White House’s ongoing efforts to calibrate its messaging on the economy ahead of next year’s midterm elections — and in the  aftermath of GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginia   earlier this month that voters indicated were driven in large part by deep disappointment with Trump’s domestic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Vance during his remarks conceded that Americans remained unhappy over the affordability issues that have weighed on those approval ratings, such as the  price of groceries . At one point, he went as far as to undercut one of Trump’s key barometers of economic success — a decline in the price of eggs since January — by admitting that the food staple is still too expensive for many people.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an American who’s just struggling to get by, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you want your kids to have good opportunities. And then the price of eggs goes from $2 a dozen to $8 a dozen under the Biden administration, and then it goes from $8 a dozen to maybe $6.50 a dozen,” Vance said. “Well, to you that is still a major problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president sought to cast much of the blame for voters’ sour mood on former President Joe Biden, complaining that the prior administration had “put us in a very tough spot.” He also blamed Democrats for any near-term economic fallout from the record-long  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  “I do think that actually pumped the brakes a little bit on all the economic news that we’re seeing,” Vance said of the shutdown. “That’s going to cause a little bit of damage.”\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also celebrated a  stronger-than-expected September jobs report  released earlier on Thursday, calling it evidence that Trump’s policies were working.\n \n\n   \n  Yet he allowed that the Trump administration still has plenty of work to do to convince voters that those policies stand to benefit them, departing from the president’s preferred approach of touting his agenda as an unqualified success.\n \n\n   \n  At a US-Saudi Investment Forum a day earlier, Trump dismissed the focus on affordability, calling it a “new word” that Democrats have latched on to since he took office.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that we’re going up in is our stock market, okay, we’re bringing prices down,” Trump said, despite the rise in the cost of key products like  beef and coffee  that economists have blamed at least in part on the administration’s tariffs. “But they came up with a new word that they’re using: affordability.”\n \n\n   \n  The president in speeches and social media posts since Democrats’ electoral victories earlier this month has also called affordability concerns a “con job,” urging voters to credit him for falling gasoline prices and an inflation rate that’s come down from its Biden-era peak — but begun over the last several months to slowly climb once again.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has floated a range of initiatives aimed at reining in the cost of living despite Trump’s insistence that prices are falling, including rolling back tariffs on hundreds of products and raising the prospect of sending $2,000 checks to Americans at some point next year. Trump is  also expected to step up domestic travel  in the coming months focused on promoting his economic agenda, as aides try to boost voter awareness of the administration’s accomplishments.\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides are also planning to  pitch a new health reform plan  ahead of the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies amid GOP fears that the party will pay a hefty political price if voters’ health insurance costs skyrocket.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has offered few details about what that plan will look like. Though Vance on Thursday claimed the eventual proposal would get bipartisan support, he did not provide specifics.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president also offered few new strategies for ushering in the booming economy that he said “we really do believe is coming,” arguing only that the administration needed a bit more time to realize its goals.\n \n\n   \n  “The thing I’d ask from the American people is to ask for a little bit of patience,” Vance said. “We just gotta keep it going.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/sport/soccer-ncaa-washington-huskies-mia-hamant","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Women’s college soccer team wins conference championship just 3 days after its beloved goalie died","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The University of Washington women's soccer team won the Big Ten tournament championship on November 9, 2025, just three days after the death of their beloved goalkeeper and teammate, Mia Hamant, who had been battling stage 4 kidney cancer since April.

That ecstasy will often be peppered with relief because things rarely go perfectly in a shootout. But for the other side, there is only dejection and heartbreak; it’s cruel to come so close to winning and lose.\n \n\n   \n  On November 9 in the Big Ten tournament championship game, it would have been hard to guess the result just from looking at the University of Washington’s  women’s soccer  players. They hugged each other tight, and some were weeping on their knees as they processed both a win and a loss: Just three days before the final, beloved goalkeeper Mia Hamant had died.\n \n\n   \n  Hamant had been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive form of stage 4 kidney cancer in April, upending her soccer dream for her senior season. But as she was tossed into a desperate fight for her life, Hamant remained an integral part of the team, both in the locker room and as their biggest cheerleader on the sidelines for home games. She was also ready to contribute on FaceTime when they were on the road.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to perfectly describe her because Mia was Mia,” the Huskies head coach Nicole Van Dyke told  CNN Sports , adding: “If I didn’t start with her being an exceptional goalkeeper, she might be upset.”\n \n\n   \n  Last season, Hamant’s save percentage ranked her as one of the top three goalkeepers in the college game, but she was valued for so much more than her ability to stop shots.\n \n\n   \n  “She was strong, resilient, an exceptional teammate,” Van Dyke continued. “She was funny, she just regularly kept us laughing, she always brought people with her. She brought us so much joy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamant documented her fight against cancer on her Instagram page,  @miakickscancer , and she maintained regular contact with the coaches while helping develop some of the players in the team, particularly this season’s sophomore goalkeeper Tanner Ijams.\n \n\n   \n  “She was probably my biggest role model and definitely my biggest inspiration going into this season,” Ijams told CNN Sports. “You could just see how incredibly strong she was throughout all of this because you could tell how much pain she was in and we all knew that she was dealing with this insane battle of her life, and yet she was still laughing with us.”\n \n\n   \n  But on November 6, the laughter stopped. The Huskies had just beaten Wisconsin in their semifinal match when they learned that they had lost their friend and teammate.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something no one’s prepared for,” explained Van Dyke, “Fortunately, we were surrounded by friends and family, and I know that’s what Mia and Mia’s family wanted for us. To be together in that moment, we’re unbelievably grateful for that.”\n \n\n   \n  They all spent the next day together, united by grief as they tried to make sense of their loss without somebody who would usually be on hand to lift their spirits.\n \n\n   \n  On a team outing to Target, they bought pajamas and candles, and at Chick-fil-A, they drank milkshakes. The next day, on the eve of the final, the senior players were asked whether they should even take the field against Michigan State. The players looked quizzically at their coach, incredulous that they were even having the conversation, but she had to be sure: Was carrying on what they all wanted to do?\n \n\n   \n  “I know she would be up there making fun of us for being so sad,” Ijams recalled. “We knew that she would want us to go out in that finals match and crush them. So, that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  The players could sense Hamant everywhere around the stadium that day, they listened to her playlist in the locker room and they couldn’t help thinking of her when a sunset, which she so admired, glowed in the exact orange hue of the ribbons they’d been wearing in her honor all season. Orange is known as the color of kidney cancer awareness.\n \n\n   \n  Nobody could have known it at the time, but in what would be one of Hamant’s final games for the Huskies, she was the hero. In a quarterfinal match of the Big Ten tournament last season, Washington beat Iowa in a penalty shootout and Hamant made three saves. It seemed tragically poetic that in the first game after her passing, the match against Michigan State would also be settled with spot kicks, during which the goalkeepers play an outsized role in the proceedings.\n \n\n   \n  “Mia loved penalties, and I definitely share that love with her,” Ijams said. “She would have been absolutely thrilled to go to penalties. I knew that we had already won the game before the penalties even started.”\n \n\n   \n  Channeling some of the tricks and mind games that her late teammate had taught her, Ijams imposed herself on the shootout, saving two of MSU’s first three kicks.\n \n\n   \n  There would be no need for a fourth. Washington’s penalty takers all converted, securing an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament and a chance to win the national title – a goal that the team is still chasing.\n \n\n   \n  After their successful spot kicks, each player paid their respects.\n \n\n   \n  Jadyn Holdenried lifted her jersey to reveal a t-shirt with the inscription “For Mia,” Laura Cetina kissed her orange wristband, and Alex Buck blew kisses to the heavens. By the time Julia Hüsch stepped up with the chance to finish the game, Ijams could feel the emotional dam breaking.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, my job was done because I knew she was going to put it away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When the players all rushed into each other’s arms a moment later, the emotion was palpable.\n \n\n   \n  “We felt that our love for (Mia) wasn’t going to be defined by any result,” explained Van Dyke. “We didn’t put pressure on ourselves to do it. I don’t think there was a dry eye in the stadium, or across the nation, to finish in penalties to win that game.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone was just sobbing in each other’s arms,” said Ijams, “We were just saying like, ‘Hey, we did it, like we did it for her.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/inflation-polls-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:35:00-05:00","title":"Polls show Trump’s happy talk on inflation is falling flat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Polling data reveals a significant gap between President Donald Trump’s claims of declining inflation and the public’s perception, with 75% of Americans reporting that grocery prices have increased over the past six months—directly contradicting Trump’s assertions that prices are down.

Trump set about falsely  claiming prices were actually down , that there is “almost no inflation,” and that everything was more or less hunky dory.\n \n\n   \n  It  was bizarre , even from a president who often seems to reside in his own elaborately crafted alternate reality.\n \n\n   \n  And it appears to be falling flat.\n \n\n   \n  New polling conducted since Trump began driving this message shows Americans continue to see things very differently than Trump has cast them. And their reviews of his economic stewardship appear to actually be getting worse.\n \n\n   \n    75% plus say grocery prices are up, despite Trump’s repeat claims\n \n\n   \n  “Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down,” Trump said November 6. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” he said at another point. He added last week that grocery prices were “already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”\n \n\n   \n  But just 12% of Americans said grocery prices have gone down over the last six months, according to a new  Marquette University Law School poll  conducted November 5 through 12.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, 75% said they’ve gone up.\n \n\n   \n  (Average grocery prices were indeed  up roughly 1.4%  in September compared to when  Trump took office in January, and the 0.6% jump in one month from July to August was the largest in three years.)\n \n\n   \n  Even among Republicans, only 2 in 10 subscribed to Trump’s alternate version of reality in which prices are actually dropping. A majority said prices are up.\n \n\n   \n  The numbers were similar in a Fox News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  That poll, conducted November 14 to 17, showed 85% of registered voters  said grocery prices are higher than a year ago, with 60% saying they’ve “increased a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  Around two-thirds or more also said the prices of utilities, healthcare and housing were up.\n \n\n   \n  (“A year ago” technically includes two months in which Trump was not yet president, but it stands to reason people perceived the question as being mostly about his tenure.)\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking: The percentage who say grocery prices are up “a lot” (60%) is significantly higher than the percentage who said that about groceries and everyday items back in October 2021 (43%). This despite inflation back then having been about double what it is today.\n \n\n   \n  That suggests this problem is really ingrained – and will be difficult for Trump to defeat with happy talk.\n \n\n   \n    The chasm between Trump’s claims and Americans’ views of inflation\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed there is “virtually no inflation,” “almost no inflation” and said inflation is “almost nonexistent.” He has also said “we don’t have any inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, inflation has remained stubborn throughout Trump’s tenure and is at about 3% on an annualized basis – right where it was when he took over.\n \n\n   \n  And the perception might be even worse.\n \n\n   \n  52% of registered voters  said inflation was “not at all” under control, according to the Fox poll. That includes nearly two-thirds of independents (65%).\n \n\n   \n  Fewer than 2 in 10 overall – and only one-third of Republicans – said inflation was at least “mostly” under control.\n \n\n   \n    Trump blames Joe Biden; the public doesn’t\n \n\n   \n  To the extent Trump has allowed that there are economic pains, he’s generally cast them as remnants of the Biden era.\n \n\n   \n  “Biden was a disaster with affordability,” Trump told Fox News shortly after the election. He added: “When I took over, it was a mess.”\n \n\n   \n  But this, too, appears to be a losing argument.\n \n\n   \n  The Fox News poll asked whether Trump or Biden were more responsible for the current economy, and voters  chose Trump, 62%-32%.\n \n\n   \n  Only around half of Republicans (53%) blamed Biden.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s numbers appear to be getting worse\n \n\n   \n  The gamble for Trump in pitching this alternate reality is evident: If people don’t ultimately subscribe to it, they might come to view Trump as out of touch and  not taking the problem seriously enough.\n \n\n   \n  Already,  CBS News-YouGov polling  has shown 75% of Americans and a majority of Republicans have said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices.\n \n\n   \n  And indeed, it seems Trump is doing himself no favors right now. If anything, his political picture on the economy and affordability is worsening:\n \n\n   \n  The same poll shows Americans say by about a 2-to-1 margin that they expected Trump’s policies will continue to increase inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Trump has given people plenty of reason to attach whatever happens with the economy to him. That’s what happens when you rock the economy with a series of unilateral global tariffs that weren’t even endorsed by Republicans in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump voluntarily took ownership of the economy. Now he wants to disclaim the reality of what’s followed.\n \n\n   \n  Political analysts love to mine Trump’s actions for secret political strategy and three-dimensional chess moves. But this seems more like desperation than anything else.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/transgender-day-remembrance-victims","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00+00:00","title":"New Environmental Protection Law Enacted, Effective April 5, 2024","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 5, 2024, a new environmental protection law came into full effect after being introduced in March 2024.

For transgender Americans, this year’s memorials will take on particular poignance, as the  Trump administration  and  conservative lawmakers  have  taken great strides  to restrict how they can live  publicly  and privately, while also eliminating  federal data collection  about anti-trans hate crimes and ending funding for an  LGBTQ suicide hotline .\n \n\n   \n  Since last November, at least 27 trans and nonbinary people have been killed, according to the nonprofit  Advocates for Trans Equality . The number is likely an undercount as precise data is difficult to collect, the organization notes. Some research has shown trans people are  more than four times  more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime.\n \n\n   \n  “In many ways, in our society, trans people are made to feel invisible,” said Bahari Thomas, the advocacy group’s director of public education.\n \n\n   \n  Trans people, particularly trans youth, are also at heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the  Trevor Project . The organization notes this may be the result of a lack of social support and exposure to stigma and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  Gwendolyn Smith – one of the activists who founded Transgender Day of Remembrance – said it’s both heartening to see her community uphold what she started decades later and sobering to see them continue to experience high rates of violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s crucial, she said, to remember the “very vibrant lives” trans victims led. “That’s our humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has profiled eight trans people who died this year, focusing on the fullness of their lives rather than the tragic circumstances of their deaths. These are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Tahiry Broom, who stood ‘ten toes down’ for her values\n \n\n   \n  Tahiry Broom could show up anywhere – from a seat at a church service to a night club’s pulsing dance floor – armed with her long, painted nails, shimmery eyeshadow and colorful wigs. Then, like magic, the whole place would belong to her.\n \n\n   \n  And Patricia Bender would most likely be there, too, watching proudly.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is Tahiry Broom’s aunt, but the two grew up more like siblings. With only five years between them, Bender and Broom spent their days in Cleveland, practically inseparable.\n \n\n   \n  “When you see me, you saw her,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  Bender said she loved Broom’s fearlessness. Broom taught her to “walk into the room like you own it, every time.”\n \n\n   \n  Broom was outspoken, always standing “ten toes down” for anyone or anything she believed in, ever since she was a kid. She was a social butterfly who “could make fun out of nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Bender, who is a member of the LGBTQ community, said Broom leaned on her for support before coming into her own as a transgender woman.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m like, ‘Hey, you can’t worry yourself worrying about what the next person is going to feel like or what the next person is going to think, because at the end of the day, you’re killing yourself trying to make everybody else happy,’” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  She also helped Broom become more acquainted with those in Cleveland’s LGBTQ community. Bender already knew “everything and everybody” and getting to know new people “was a big thing” for Broom.\n \n\n   \n  She was outgoing. She loved everybody, and they loved her back.\n \n\n   \n  Going one to two weeks without hearing from her wasn’t cause for concern. She was independent and tended to mind her own business.\n \n\n   \n  But in February, Bender’s phone began to ring and ring and ring. She hesitated to answer, sensing there may be bad news on the other end of the line.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes your phone rings and it rings different,” Bender said.\n \n\n   \n  When she finally answered her cousins’ FaceTime call and saw their rosy and tear-stained faces, she said she felt numb.\n \n\n   \n  Broom – visiting snowy Southfield, Michigan, at the time – had been shot and killed, less than a month before her 30th birthday.\n \n\n   \n  “My little brother, my nephews, my male cousins, I worry about them. They’ll be outside doing only God knows what,” Bender said. “Tahiry? Nobody worries about Tahiry.”\n \n\n   \n  A suspect in Broom’s death has been charged with second-degree murder and remains in custody, awaiting a trial date, according to Southfield police.\n \n\n   \n  Hearing of an arrest in Broom’s case was a “calming feeling” for Bender, but getting her justice would involve the suspect being “in a cell for the rest of his life,” she said. She and her family members keep up with the case by regularly attending the suspect’s Zoom hearings.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers and advocacy groups say Black trans women, like Broom, are disproportionately impacted by violence. Of the 372 trans victims identified by Human Rights Watch between 2013 and 2024, 73% were women of color, and 60% were Black women.\n \n\n   \n  Bender is still Broom’s “ying and yang.” Her “frick and frack.”\n \n\n   \n  Her niece might have thought introducing her to the local LGBTQ scene, being older or being her “auntie” made Bender Broom’s “savior.” But Broom, Bender said, saved her too.\n \n\n   \n  “I may be helping you in a sense or exposing you to this…and I’m helping you live your truth,” she added. “And the whole time, you think you need me. But the whole time, I needed you more.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Sydney Bishop \n \n\n   \n    Karmin Wells, a Detroit ballroom legend whose walk rivaled Naomi Campbell\n \n\n   \n  She was the “walking wonder” of Detroit’s queer ballroom scene – a nightlife runway legend whose hip-twisting strut is rumored to have put Naomi Campbell to shame. She wouldn’t hit the runway in anything less than six-inch heels, and the jangle of jewelry and sharp clack of her heels announced her presence almost everywhere she went.\n \n\n   \n  She was Karmin Wells – nothing more and nothing less.\n \n\n   \n  “Her style can’t be mimicked ever again,” said her aunt, Markeitha Bibb. “When she came in, they knew what it is. They knew she was (going to) take the stage.”\n \n\n   \n  The 37-year-old was a staple of the local ballroom community, a historic queer subculture where performers compete in categories that include modeling, dancing and “voguing.” Often, performers compete as members of a “house,” a chosen family that can provide a support system that biological families sometimes cannot.\n \n\n   \n  Wells had worked the stage for years, eventually earning the status of “legend” and becoming the mother of the Detroit chapter of the internationally-renowned House of Revlon.\n \n\n   \n  Monica Hudson met Wells when she was still a teenager. Hudson had been doing LGBTQ community outreach at the city’s Palmer Park when she came across Wells and was instantly charmed by her witty sense of humor.\n \n\n   \n  “Our interaction was so real and so raw and authentic. She ended up becoming my chosen daughter,” Hudson said. When Wells was killed on May 25, Hudson said it felt like “losing a part of myself.”\n \n\n   \n  Wells was shot to death in her home just days before her 38th birthday. Police say the suspect has not been identified or charged.\n \n\n   \n  “The world lost a talented, funny, loving, caring, hardworking hustler. The world has lost a gem,” said Hudson.\n \n\n   \n  She cared deeply for her grandfather, Willie Bibb, and her younger sister, Kimari Howard, her aunt said. And she had formed her own sprawling family of chosen children – younger people she mentored and uplifted, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever you gave her, she gave it back to you 10 times,” said Marcel Goudeaux-Stanley, Wells’ close friend and former significant other. “You could never outdo her. She had a really, really big heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Never staying in one place for long, Wells’ suitcase seemed to always be packed. She would leave Michigan at a moment’s notice, traveling to Las Vegas to hit the casinos or to Atlanta to compete in balls, Bibb said. Then, she would show up on her aunt’s doorstep, insisting they go out to Gigi’s or the Woodward, popular LGBTQ bars in Detroit.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s always on the go. She’s always hustling,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  But Wells found peace in small ways: through morning devotionals to God, performing alone in the privacy of her living room, and finding the company of those who knew who she was when the aura of entertainment wore off, Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n  “When she’s around people that she loves, that genuinely love her, and when she can be comfortable and she can rest, that’s where she’s genuinely happy,” Hudson said.\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Lia Smith, a curious student athlete and formidable board game opponent\n \n\n   \n  For her parents, Lia Smith’s birth was a dream come true – albeit a little nerve-racking.\n \n\n   \n  Born early at just over 31 weeks and under 4 pounds, Smith arrived just minutes before her twin (a fact she would later point out with pride to her “baby” sister). Her father, Greg Smith, camped out in the NICU for weeks until he and his husband, Keith, were able to take the babies home to meet their other child.\n \n\n   \n  “We were just thrilled beyond belief,” Greg Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  Smith grew into a healthy child and young adult who was deeply empathetic, “intrinsically curious and very hardworking,” her father said.\n \n\n   \n  She filled her days learning piano and trombone, going to swim practice, poring over books on world history, and playing board games and cards with her family. Exceptional with numbers and problem-solving, she eventually learned how to count cards and maximize her odds of winning.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I learned to only play games of pure chance with her if I wanted to win,” Smith said at his daughter’s   memorial service earlier this month. “Simply put, she was smarter than me.”\n \n\n   \n  Diving became a “core part of her existence,” he said. At age 8, Smith began training with Stanford’s youth swim program, and by the time she left home for college, her bedroom walls were decorated with hundreds of competition ribbons.\n \n\n   \n  Though she was recruited by several colleges to compete on their men’s teams, she was delighted to be invited to compete on the women’s team at Middlebury College in Vermont, her father said.\n \n\n   \n  It would be the first time she would compete on a team that aligned with her identity. After her first year at Middlebury, Smith stopped competing in diving but continued to practice with the team.\n \n\n   \n  “She was really more focused on being one of the girls,” Smith said. “It was very affirming, and mostly she just wanted to hang out with them and practice.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Smith returned to Middlebury as a senior, working towards degrees in statistics and computer science. The 21-year-old was somehow able to find time to pursue other interests as well.\n \n\n   \n  “She loved to debate the history of Japan or think about the intricacies of China. She had a keen and eclectic interest, and it made it always fun and interesting to talk to her.”\n \n\n   \n  Though she loved to spend time with family and friends, she was at her core an introvert. In her cherished private moments, she would read, sit down at the piano, or write poetry, which she rarely shared.\n \n\n   \n  But while Lia was deeply loved, her father Greg said at her memorial that she “lived on a daily basis with the quiet whispers of judgment and the furrowed brows of contempt.”\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Lia was reported missing. After a days-long search, her body was found near the college campus. She had died by suicide.\n \n\n   \n  Lia did not leave a note explaining why she killed herself, but her father noted that she had felt the brunt of cultural backlash against transgender people, a feeling he said was only exacerbated by online harassment and  a parade of restrictions  on transgender people under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Over time, I believe the relentless negativity exhausted her,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of people attended memorial services at Middlebury and at Smith’s high school, her father said. He was stricken by the “infinite love” shared at the services and the outpouring of support he has received from strangers online.\n \n\n   \n  “She was perfect for us in every way,” he said. “We cherished her, and others did, too.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe \n \n\n   \n    Amyri Dior, a mother figure with a musical soul\n \n\n   \n  Even though Amyri Dior didn’t have children, she was like a mother to all. She guided and cared for her loved ones in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, deeply. And when it came to her family and friends’ children, she didn’t play around — she looked after them like her own.\n \n\n   \n  “My child, her friend’s children, she would claim them as her kids,” Alejandra Rederford, Dior’s cousin and best friend, said. “Always giving. She will give her last, even if it’s her last … Amyri was a good, caring, genuine soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Dior also “didn’t discriminate” when it came to music and had a passion for singing, rapping and dancing. Rederford said sometimes she would sing while Dior rapped on the spot. Through giggles, she also recalled a memory of Dior dancing in a parking lot once to the sound of a car alarm.\n \n\n   \n  “She would try to hype the people around her to dance,” Rederford said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would write her own songs, her grandmother, Carrie Joyner, remembered.\n \n\n   \n  “She sang her own music from her own voice. She loved singing with such character,” Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  Dior would also take the time to have deep conversations with Rederford and others about her experience as a trans woman. She was confident in her identity, even if some people didn’t accept her.\n \n\n   \n  Rederford and Joyner also highlighted Dior’s immense strength, living in foster care as a child for eight years before ultimately running away to her grandma’s house.\n \n\n   \n  Dior and Rederford were only a year apart, and mid-February was always a special time, with their birthdays on February 15 on February 21, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  On Dior’s 23rd birthday this year, they celebrated with a house party full of food and drinks. Dior sang along to songs she loved while laughing with her friends and family.\n \n\n   \n  Just seven days later, the two were supposed to be celebrating Rederford’s birthday together. While Rederford was still getting dressed, she answered a phone call, thinking it was Dior ready to be picked up for the night of festivities. Instead, the voice on the other line was her aunt, telling her Dior had been shot.\n \n\n   \n  A man has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in Dior’s death, according to a criminal complaint from the Milwaukee District Attorney’s office obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “She was a shining soul,” Rederford said. “She was really loved. Everywhere she (went), she was loved.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Taylor Galgano \n \n\n   \n    Kelsey Elem, who was chasing her dream of modeling\n \n\n   \n  Kelsey Elem’s smile could light up a room the moment she walked in, her mother, Calvenita Brock, said. She said Kelsey moved through the world with love, the kind you could feel just being around her.\n \n\n   \n  “Kelsey would give a person any and everything,” Brock said.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Greenville, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, with her mother and two brothers, Elem ran track, sang in the church choir and loved animals. Later, she joined Job Corps and received her nursing certificate, her mother said.\n \n\n   \n  Elem loved fashion. She was always dressed to impress, known for her bold style and her signature long nails. Brock said the two were very close, and Elem often turned to her for styling advice.\n \n\n   \n  “She’ll come by the house like, ‘Ma, I need to go in your closet, and I’m on my way, get me something out. I need something to wear today.’”\n \n\n   \n  Brock said she spoke to Elem daily, up until the morning of her death on April 24. She was 25 years old when she was fatally shot. The suspect, whom Brock has identified as one of Elem’s friends, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree domestic assault and armed criminal action.\n \n\n   \n  The day before her death, Elem posted on Facebook about how proud she was of her transition journey and how happy she was with life.\n \n\n   \n  “She fought to be the woman and the queen that she were,” Brock said. Elem strove to show other trans people “that they didn’t have to have shame, they didn’t have to feel unloved, because, you know, some people’s … loved ones don’t accept them, and Kelsey was there to let them know, because I accepted my child.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time of her death, she was traveling around the US as a model, building a dream she had long imagined.\n \n\n   \n  “She been traveling all around and so she kept telling me, ‘Mom, you got to come on,’” Brock said. “So she told me, ‘Well, I’m (going to) make sure I do all this for you, Ma, you wanted to do all this, and you stopped for us.’”\n \n\n   \n  She was laid to rest on May 9 in a red, pink, white and green casket adorned with photos of her and the words “goodbyes are not forever.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Amanda Jackson \n \n\n   \n    Sam Nordquist, who dreamed of buying a log cabin filled with animals\n \n\n   \n  A man so kind he would give you the shirt off his back.\n \n\n   \n  That’s how Linda Nordquist describes her son Sam. His kindness permeated every part of his life, from the patient demeanor he assumed at his job caring for vulnerable adults to the loving care he showed his pet cats and lizards, or the way he showered his young nieces and nephews with affection. On drives around Minneapolis, Nordquist would often buy extra food to hand out to the homeless, his sister, Kayla Nordquist, said.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist’s confidence blossomed after he transitioned, his sister said, buoyed by a close-knit and deeply supportive family. His mother helped administer his testosterone shots and carefully emptied his surgical drains after he got top surgery. Although transgender identity was new to her, “Sam is still Sam to me, and I loved Sam no matter what,” his mother said.\n \n\n   \n  He was close with his family, often jetting off for road trips with his sister and her children or binging true crime shows together. He lived with his mother, and they built a familiar routine: sharing a cigarette before work, walking the dog together, and making plans for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Last September, their routine ended when Nordquist traveled to upstate New York to meet a woman he had met online. Nordquist was tortured to death in early February, according to New York State Police. Seven people have been indicted on murder charges for their involvement. He was 24. Authorities have said there is no evidence of a hate crime but said Nordquist was treated “like a dog” before his death: beaten, assaulted, sexually abused, starved, and held captive for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “My heart is shattered,” his sister said. Kayla Nordquist said she still wakes up every day wanting to text her brother. For his mother, “life will never be the same. Life will never be normal as we used to know it.”\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist had big aspirations, his family said: He dreamed of buying a log cabin, filled with animals. His mother wishes most of all she could have seen Nordquist find “actual true love.” It stings, she said, that she’ll never see her son get married or have children.\n \n\n   \n  In Minnesota, Nordquist’s family is dedicated to keeping his memory alive as they brace for their first holiday season without him. His sister had a portrait of him tattooed on her arm, and both his sister and mother got tattoos of “8,995,” the number of days Nordquist was alive. For Christmas, his mother is decorating the tree with ornaments adorned with her son’s name.\n \n\n   \n  His mother has taken responsibility for his cat, who sometimes wakes her up scratching at the door of Nordquist’s room, which she’s left untouched since he was killed. His sister, meanwhile, took in his bearded dragon – and she’s found herself caring for the lizard just as lovingly as Nordquist did, decorating its tank for Halloween and Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  Nordquist “was the most gentle, kindest, sweetest person that you’ll probably ever meet,” his mother said. “And the world should know that they’re all missing out on him.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Zoe Sottile \n \n\n   \n    Laura Schueler, the ‘Beyonce of Cincinnati’ with an eye for consignment shopping\n \n\n   \n  Laura Schueler was the friend you could call for anything.\n \n\n   \n  De’Whitney Hankins said she would text Schueler for help with outfit choices because she trusted her fashion instincts. Schueler, a transgender woman, was known for wearing trendy furs, jackets, shoes and purses often purchased from consignment shops, Hankins said. Her edgy style prompted some in their circle of friends to call Schueler the “Beyonce of Cincinnati,” Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was very much outgoing,” said Hankins, a transgender woman who befriended Schueler in the 1990s when they were living in the same neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  But the light Schueler brought to others— along with her fun, selfless and caring spirit— darkened when she was  shot and killed on June 7  in Cincinnati, Hankins said. Schueler was 47. A 19-year-old man was arrested on July 11 in connection with her death and charged with murder, felonious assault, among other charges, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said Schueler was confident and secure with herself, which inspired many others in the transgender community. She cared deeply about her family, including her nieces and nephews, Hankins said.\n \n\n   \n  “She was not a taker,” Hankins said. “She was more of a giver. If you were hungry, she would give you money or take you to get something to eat. And she would give you the clothes off her back.”\n \n\n   \n  Hankins said she believes Schueler was targeted because she was a transgender woman and her death was a hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot of love to give, and we still had stuff to do,” Hankins said. “My heart is empty.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Nicquel Terry Ellis \n \n\n   \n    Dream Johnson, whose animated personality was made for reality TV\n \n\n   \n  When she began her transition three years ago, Iris Terrell’s daughter chose a new name for herself, one that her mother said fit her perfectly: Dream.\n \n\n   \n  “Dream wanted to be a superstar one day,” said Terrell.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson thought her big, confident personality would be perfect for a reality show and wanted to be on TV, Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a beautiful soul and would always, always keep you laughing,” her mother said. “She was the life of the party.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s aunt, Vanna Terrell, said her niece’s desire to be in the spotlight even extended to their holiday gatherings.\n \n\n   \n  “We would say we’re going to color coordinate, and Dream would go outside the box and wear something totally different,” Vanna laughs. “We would have a family function, and she would dress like Diana Ross.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s mother and aunt say the family supported her transition and credit Dream’s closest friends for helping her find her own new style.\n \n\n   \n  “They were pushing her to come out of her shell – to be whoever she wanted to be,” Vanna Terrell said.\n \n\n   \n  “I know for a fact that her friends are definitely going through the hardest time now because they stayed together,” she adds.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson’s life was cut short in July at the age of 28 when she was shot four times on a sidewalk in her hometown of Washington, DC, in a residential neighborhood about two miles from the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  According to a court document, witnesses say Dream got into an argument with a group of strangers mocking her and calling her “a boy” and a slur used to attack the LGBTQ community.\n \n\n   \n  Although surveillance footage showed Johnson never physically attacked anyone, according to police, a member of the group allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot her to death. She was unarmed,  prosecutors say .\n \n\n   \n  The suspect is charged with first-degree murder, and the case is classified as a gender identity hate crime.\n \n\n   \n  Although the allegation that Dream was targeted for being transgender is painful to her family, they also feel it is important that the reality of the crime be recognized.\n \n\n   \n  “We were pushing for that. We wanted the hate crime (charge),” Vanna said. “We needed the world to know that this is still out here.”\n \n\n   \n  That kind of hate was something Johnson never had to worry about at home.\n \n\n   \n  “I told her she was kind. She was beautiful,” said Johnson’s mother. “Can’t no one change you from being you, and don’t let no one change you.”\n \n\n   \n  Iris Terrell keeps Johnson’s positive spirit even through the sadness surrounding her death, but said the holidays will be hard this year.\n \n\n   \n  But despite her family’s tragedy, Iris Terrell only has   happy memories of her daughter and the person she became.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one thing that I loved about her – that she was herself.”\n \n\n   \n   From CNN’s Andy Rose \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/dick-cheney-funeral-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:55:00-05:00","title":"Bush, Biden and former vice presidents honor Dick Cheney, while Trump, Vance snubbed for funeral invitation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dick Cheney, the former U.S. vice president and a key figure in pre-MAGA Republican politics, died on November 3, 2025, at age 84.

Vance said Thursday that the former vice president was “a guy who served his country,” and wished his family “all the best in this moment of grieving.” Trump has not publicly expressed his condolences or commented on Cheney’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney received full military honors at the invitation-only memorial service at Washington’s National Cathedral. Former Presidents Joe Biden and George W. Bush and former first ladies Jill Biden and Laura Bush attended as well as former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle.\n \n\n   \n  Bush eulogized his former vice president as a consummate public servant who could be relied on, and who “lifted the standards” of those around him.\n \n\n   \n  “His abilities were self-evident, without need of calculation or self-promotion,” Bush said. “His talent and restraint exceeded his ego.”\n \n\n   \n  The former president recalled that Cheney was initially tapped to help him find a running mate during his 2000 presidential run. But after going over the list of names, Bush said he came to realize that Cheney himself was the best man for the job.\n \n\n   \n  The former president said Cheney rattled off a list of reasons why he should not serve as his running mate when Bush approached him with the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “I told him that, at such a moment, most in his position would have jumped at the chance, but Dick stayed detached and he analyzed it before I made my decision,” Bush said. “He insisted on giving me a complete rundown of all of the reasons I should not choose him.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney would go on to serve two terms with Bush, becoming one of the most influential and powerful vice presidents in modern history.\n \n\n   \n  Also in attendance at the memorial service were a number of Supreme Court Justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. A large number of past and present Cabinet members from both Republican and Democratic administrations were also expected, as well as congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi was present along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and former leader Mitch McConnell.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, who served as Bush’s vice president from 2001 to 2009, died on November 3 at the age of 84. Prior to being elected vice president, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and as a congressman representing Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n  He was further remembered for his progressive stance on several social issues, including gay marriage, but his role as the architect of the Iraq War saw him leave office  deeply unpopular  and cemented a polarizing legacy.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Williams, who worked as Pentagon press secretary during Cheney’s time as defense secretary, recalled offering to resign from his position after a magazine outed him as gay in 1991.\n \n\n   \n  “He wouldn’t hear of it, and for several days after that article appeared, he would call me on the direct line to my desk at the Pentagon to ask how I was doing and to tell me to get on with the job,” Williams said.\n \n\n   \n  While official Washington funerals usually include invites to the White House, excluding Trump should not be a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was a lifetime hardline conservative who endorsed Trump’s 2016 campaign. But he spent the last years of his life speaking out against Trump, particularly after his daughter then-Rep. Liz Cheney drew the president’s ire for her prominent role in a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021,  insurrection at the Capitol .\n \n\n   \n  Liz Cheney made a reference to her father’s decision to support Harris over Trump last year. “For him,” she said, “a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.”\n \n\n   \n  The funeral’s guest list itself was also a nod to a time when Washington was not so polarized and politicians from both sides of the aisle paid their respects when a dignitary passed away.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Cheney  described Trump as a coward  and said no one was a “greater threat to our republic.”\n \n\n   \n  Pence, who similarly broke with Trump over the president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said that Cheney gave him two pieces of advice shortly after Pence was elected vice president in 2016. He urged Pence to spend “a lot of time on Capitol Hill” and to receive the president’s daily brief first thing in the morning, before attending any meeting with the president, in order to be better prepared for what would be discussed.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a way that he said, ‘You will be better equipped to be able to advise the president if you know in advance what’s coming and can run that through the filter of the president’s priorities,’” Pence told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny before the funeral.\n \n\n   \n  The White House offered a muted reaction after Cheney’s death with press secretary Karoline Leavitt telling reporters that Trump was “aware” the former vice president had died and noting that flags had been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Trump not being invited to the funeral, which  Axios  was first to report.\n \n\n   \n  Honorary pallbearers at Cheney’s funeral included members of his Secret Service detail; his former chiefs of staff, David Addington and Scooter Libby; and photographer David Hume Kennerly.\n \n\n   \n  On one of the last pages of the service leaflet was a quote from the writer and naturalist John Muir, saying: “The mountains are calling and I must go.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/shutdown-holiday-travel-callout","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-05:00","title":"Changed your Thanksgiving plans?

Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order that would block states from enforcing regulations around artificial intelligence, renewing an AI deregulation push that’s raising concerns among tech safety advocates and state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n \n\n   \n  The draft order directs the US attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws and preempt them with Trump’s more lax federal policy, according to a copy viewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving technology is already subject to little oversight as it extends into more areas of life — from personal communications and relationships to health care and policing. In the absence of broad federal legislation, some states have passed laws to address potentially risky and harmful uses of AI, such as the creation of misleading deepfakes and algorithmic discrimination in hiring. Critics of the preemption push worry that if left unchecked, AI companies could evade accountability should their tools harm consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for comment about the pushback, a White House official told CNN that until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential orders is speculation.\n \n\n   \n  The language in Trump’s draft order mirrors the argument from some in the tech industry, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, that navigating a patchwork of state laws would slow down innovation and could affect America’s competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome, uniform national policy framework for AI,” the draft order states.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also suggested adding language blocking state AI regulations to the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual defense policy bill, in a Tuesday  post  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Congress killed an earlier attempt by Republicans to prevent states from regulating AI in July. The US Senate voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill before the bill passed. Weeks later, the Trump administration released a Silicon Valley-friendly  AI action plan , a package of initiatives and policy recommendations that largely centered on scaling back AI regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n \n\n   \n  While some in Silicon Valley may support easing up on AI regulation, the proposal has received broad pushback as concerns about AI safety have escalated in recent months. A growing  string of reports  have highlighted risks of the technology causing  delusions  or contributing to  self-harm  among users. Companies like OpenAI and Meta have also been scrambling to  block young people  from accessing adult content via AI systems.\n \n\n   \n  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the effort “federal government overreach” in a Tuesday  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Stripping states of jurisdiction to regulate AI is a subsidy to Big Tech and will prevent states from protecting against online censorship of political speech, predatory applications that target children, violations of intellectual property rights and data center intrusions on power/water resources,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Senator Ed Markey called out Republicans for “trying to sneak their AI regulation moratorium into the defense bill” and accused Trump of siding “with his billionaire Big Tech buddies,” in an X  post  Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The renewed preemption push comes as Trump hosted a dinner at the White House this week for business leaders, which was attended by many AI industry leaders, including Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and tech investor and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of organizations — including tech employee unions and other labor groups, tech safety and consumer protection nonprofits and educational institutions —  signed   letters to Congress  this week opposing the idea of blocking state AI regulations and raising alarms about AI safety risks.\n \n\n   \n  “This draft executive order isn’t about interstate commerce or American competitiveness,” Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, vice president of The Leadership Conference’s Center for Civil Rights and Technology, said in a statement. “It’s about giving the administration’s tech billionaire buddies and corporations a free pass rather than protecting the people it’s meant to serve.”\n \n\n   \n  J.B. Branch, big tech accountability advocate at the consumer protection nonprofit Public Citizen, noted in a statement that “AI scams are exploding, children have died by suicide linked to harmful online systems, and psychologists are warning about AI-induced breakdowns” and that blocking state regulations could “shield Silicon Valley from responsibility.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israel-west-bank-war-crimes-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Israel’s Forced Expulsion of Palestinians from West Bank Refugee Camps Amounts to War Crimes, HRW Alleges","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, Israel forcibly expelled over 32,000 Palestinians from three West Bank refugee camps—Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams—using military force including helicopters, bulldozers, and armored vehicles.

tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the  occupied West Bank  earlier this year amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has alleged.\n \n\n   \n  According to a 105-page report released by the non-profit organization, 32,000 Palestinians were expelled by Israeli forces from three camps in January and February, while international attention was focused on  Israel’s war in Gaza , and they have not been allowed to return.\n \n\n   \n  As part of its research, HRW said it interviewed 31 displaced Palestinian refugees from Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery and Israeli military demolition orders, as well as verified video and images of Israeli military operations.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN in a statement that the military launched what it called Operation “Iron Wall” in the three camps ten months ago “in light of the security threats posed by these camps and the growing presence of terrorist elements within them.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it destroyed “rows of buildings” to create “new access routes inside the camps.” The military said the decision to demolish the buildings “was made based on operational necessity, with careful consideration and only after alternative options to achieve the same military advantage were examined.”\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said the “demolitions were conducted lawfully, based on military necessity and with the required proportionality” and that “terrorism in Judea and Samaria has decreased by 70%” since the start of the operation, using the biblical term for the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  The HRW report claims that Israel stormed Jenin refugee camp on January 21, with Apache helicopters, drones, bulldozers, and armored vehicles carrying ground forces, to oust the Palestinians living there.\n \n\n   \n  Similar operations were carried out at Tulkaram on January 27, and Nur Shams on February 9.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli soldiers “were yelling and throwing things everywhere…. It was like a movie scene – some had masks and they were carrying all kinds of weapons,” one 54-year-old woman told HRW.\n \n\n   \n  The displaced Palestinians have not been permitted to return home, the report found, adding that Israeli soldiers fired upon those who did attempt to re-enter. Only a few have been allowed to collect their belongings, it said, while HRW analysis of satellite imagery six months on found that more than 850 homes and other buildings had been damaged or destroyed across the camps.\n \n\n   \n  No shelter or humanitarian assistance was offered to displaced residents by the Israeli military, the report found. Instead, people were left to fend for themselves, seeking shelter wherever they could, including crowding into the homes of relatives or friends, or arriving at mosques or local charities.\n \n\n   \n  All three camps date back to the early 1950s, when they were established by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to house Palestinians who were expelled from their homes or forced to flee following Israel’s creation in 1948. Those refugees and their descendants had resided there ever since.\n \n\n   \n  “Israeli authorities in early 2025 forcibly removed 32,000 Palestinians from their homes in West Bank refugee camps without regard to international legal protections and have not permitted them to return,” Nadia Hardman, a senior migrant rights researcher at HRW, said.\n \n\n   \n  “With global attention focused on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing in the West Bank that should be investigated and prosecuted.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has intensified operations across the West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing checkpoints, and cutting communities off from the outside world.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been an escalation in Israeli settler attacks and land grabs in the territory. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law.\n \n\n   \n  HRW is now calling for senior Israeli officials to be investigated over the expulsions, including Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, the Central Command commander who oversaw West Bank military operations.\n \n\n   \n  Where found responsible, they should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the organization said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/entertainment/hunger-games-sunrise-first-look","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Our first look at ‘The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping’ is already a wild ride","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, a prequel set 24 years before the original events, premieres on November 20, 2026, focusing on the origin of Haymitch Abernathy, played by Joseph Zada.

and a clean slate: Saudi Arabia’s crown prince got almost everything he wanted from Trump \n       \n  Analysis by Abbas Al Lawati and Becky Anderson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Just three years ago, the US was openly  reconsidering its relationship  with Saudi Arabia. President Joe Biden had vowed to make Mohammed bin Salman a pariah. Even arms sales to one of America’s closest military partners were put under review.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the crown prince and de facto Saudi leader walked into the Oval Office to find a different world - one where President Donald Trump defended him so forcefully that he scolded a reporter for “ embarrassing our guest ” when she pressed him on the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the Oval Office theatrics, the substance of the administration’s announcements tells the real story of bin Salman’s remarkable rehabilitation in Washington. It also highlights Trump’s willingness to move past the Khashoggi episode and deepen relations with a kingdom that has pledged  nearly a trillion dollars  in US investments and maintains business ties with his own family.\n \n\n   \n  The visit also underscores the crown prince’s growing clout and his ability to skillfully navigate great power rivalries to his advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps his biggest win was persuading Trump to drop the one condition Washington had long insisted on before sealing major defense and trade deals with Riyadh: Full normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The shift marks another reversal from just a year ago, when the Biden administration insisted that any comprehensive US-Saudi deal could only move forward if  all three of its components  – bilateral defense and trade agreements, Saudi normalization with Israel, and an Israeli commitment to a pathway to a Palestinian state – advanced together. But with Israel rejecting the prospect of a Palestinian state and Saudi Arabia refusing to soften its position, the framework stalled.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Trump administration appears to have decoupled those components, handing Riyadh most of what it has long sought on defense, economics and regional security.\n \n\n   \n  This week it designated Saudi Arabia a Major Non-NATO Ally, moved forward with plans to  sell it F-35 jets  “pretty similar” to those flown by Israel, and signed a new Strategic Defense Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  In a nod to Riyadh’s singular focus to rewire its economy away from oil dependence, the two countries launched an  AI cooperation framework  which includes clearing of the sale of advanced chips to the kingdom, signed a critical minerals agreement, and opened the door to expand cooperation on nuclear energy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also delivered on bin Salman’s regional requests as the crown prince tries to reshape the Middle East’s security landscape, agreeing to help end the civil war in Sudan\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office, bin Salman framed the new agreements as delivering benefits for both the US and Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a very important time in our history,” bin Salman said in the Oval Office on Tuesday, seated beside Trump.\n \n\n   \n    What Saudi Arabia didn’t get\n \n\n   \n  While bin Salman received almost everything Saudi Arabia has been seeking from the US, there were two notable exceptions: a green light to domestically enrich uranium for future nuclear plants and a formal defense commitment.\n \n\n   \n  The US has long been reluctant to back a Saudi nuclear program that includes domestic uranium enrichment – a process that can produce bomb-grade material if purified to high levels – but CNN understands that Riyadh is reluctant to give up its right to do so, citing its substantial uranium deposits. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News on Wednesday that the agreement doesn’t include domestic enrichment.\n \n\n   \n  Among Washington’s Arab allies, Qatar has the strongest defense relationship with the US. It hosts the biggest US airbase in the region, was declared a Major Non-NATO ally in 2022, and this year received the strongest US security commitment for any Arab state, through an executive order declaring that any armed attack on the nation would be regarded as “a  threat to the peace and security  of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that Saudi Arabia is seeking at least as deep a security commitment from Washington. A senior Saudi source told CNN the kingdom wants a permanent agreement that would last beyond Trump’s presidency, a move that would ultimately require Congressional approval. But a White House statement made no mention of any obligation to defend the kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  “What (bin Salman) reportedly wants is a Senate-ratified defense commitment along the lines of a NATO Article 5 pledge,” wrote Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment think tank, referring to NATO’s mutual defense clause. “The last time Washington delivered that was 65 years ago, with the 1960 US-Japan treaty.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a case to be made for such a pact, he continued. “The United States went to war to protect Saudi and Gulf oil before, a defense pact might prove to be a deterrent to future predators, and it would lock Saudi Arabia into a pro-American alignment for years to come, boxing out our competitors Russia and especially China.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia has been signaling that it is willing to seek defense partners beyond the US should Washington not make a stronger commitment to its security. In late 2023, bin Salman was  explicit about the threat  in an interview with Fox News, saying the US doesn’t “want to see Saudi Arabia shifting their armament from America to another place.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Riyadh has been gradually  improving its ties with Beijing , culminating in the surprise rapprochement  between Saudi Arabia and Iran  in the Chinese capital in March 2023. The message has been that the US is Riyadh’s  first port of call , but there are others too.\n \n\n   \n  And earlier this year, bin Salman followed through on his quest to diversify security partners, securing protection from Riyadh’s closest Muslim ally, nuclear armed Pakistan. The mutual defense agreement marked a striking expansion of the kingdom’s search for non-US security guarantees.\n \n\n   \n  That hedging has not gone unnoticed in the halls of power in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s a positive move,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a top Republican foreign policy voice, said about the growing defense partnership between Riyadh and Washington. “Because to pull Saudi as an ally of the United States in this direction, rather than to China, and it will also solidify normalization in that process, in a post Gaza world.”\n \n\n   \n  The Eurasia Group think tank said in an analysis piece last week that the US-Saudi relationship is now driven more by great power competition than normalization with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “The kingdom has become a key strategic partner in the US’s competition with China,” it said. “The strategic convergence underway between Washington and Riyadh will continue to be underpinned by the role the kingdom can play in supporting the US in sectors that are crucial for US competition with China.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that Riyadh’s calculation on normalization has shifted as Saudi public sentiment toward Israel has grown more negative and the kingdom has already secured many of the gains it expected from Washington.\n \n\n   \n  In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he got a “positive response” from bin Salman on normalizing with Israel but said he wouldn’t “use the word ‘commitment’.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alison Main, Manu Raju and Casey Riddle contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-survivors-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-05:00","title":"‘We have power together’: For Epstein survivors, a day of emotion and triumph","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse convened in Washington, D.C., to demand transparency and accountability through legislative action.

 \n  By MJ Lee, Nicky Robertson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:53 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The scrum outside of the Cannon office building early Tuesday morning slowly grew in size, eventually ballooning to several dozen women. Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-05:00","title":"Invest in crypto?

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by  February 17, 2026  in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2026 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/business/walmart-economy-consumers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Walmart just proved it’s America’s solution to the affordability crisis","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Walmart is emerging as a key solution to the U.S. affordability crisis, with strong sales growth, increased market share, and rising consumer confidence in its pricing and product quality.

12:43 PM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Week 12 of the  NFL  season brings about a big game for Patrick Mahomes and Co., injury intrigue and a sneakily important  Monday Night Football  game.\n \n\n   \n  From Shedeur Sanders starting for the Cleveland Browns to the Cincinnati Bengals never seeming to catch a break, here are five things to know about Week 12.\n \n\n   \n    Rodgers’ wrist clouds Steelers’ week\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers fans can breathe – at least a little. Head coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that Aaron Rodgers will not need surgery on the fracture in his left, non-throwing wrist. Whether he actually plays Sunday in Chicago? Still a coin flip.\n \n\n   \n  The 41-year-old’s practice status on Friday will likely decide everything. Rodgers said his ability to protect himself is going to be the deciding factor, not pain management.\n \n\n   \n  And make no mistake: Rodgers would love nothing more than another crack at the Bears. During his Packers days, he saw them twice a year and went 24-5 against Chicago, famously telling fans – multiple times – that he “owns” the Bears.\n \n\n   \n  If Rodgers can’t go, Mason Rudolph is expected to step in.\n \n\n   \n    Bengals defense reaches historic lows\n \n\n   \n   Joe Burrow  could return on Thanksgiving night against the Baltimore Ravens – but the Bengals may already be out of runway.\n \n\n   \n  At 3-7, Cincinnati can’t afford another slip if it wants any shot at the postseason. The defense, in particular, has put them in a historic hole. The Bengals have allowed 27 or more points in each of the last nine games, becoming the first team in NFL history to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Now, they get a New England Patriots team that’s quietly rolling. Rookie quarterback Drake Maye leads the NFL with 2,836 passing yards, and here’s the wild part: He hasn’t had a single 300-yard game. No explosions – just relentless, efficient production every week.\n \n\n   \n  The Patriots are 9-2 and suddenly staring at a possible No. 1 seed if they keep stacking wins.\n \n\n   \n    Chiefs-Colts: A season-defining test\n \n\n   \n  The AFC’s game of the week features the 5-5 Chiefs hosting the 8-2 Indianapolis Colts, and nothing about Kansas City’s season has gone the way anyone expected.\n \n\n   \n  A year after going 11-0 in one-score games, the Chiefs are 0-5 in those same situations this season. The late-game Mahomes magic just hasn’t shown up. The three-time Super Bowl winner has bluntly put the blame on himself: “We haven’t been consistent enough to win games. It starts with me.”\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming the Chiefs’ starter, Mahomes has never failed to reach at least the AFC Championship Game. A loss on Sunday would drop Kansas City to 5-6, and the margin for error the rest of the way becomes razor-thin.\n \n\n   \n    Another week, another Browns QB\n \n\n   \n  The more things change, the more they stay the same: A new QB is going to be under center in Cleveland. The Browns are turning to rookie Shedeur Sanders on Sunday in Las Vegas, making him the 42nd starting quarterback the franchise has used since returning in 1999 – a staggering reminder of the instability that has defined the position in Cleveland for over 25 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sanders was thrown into the fire last week against the Ravens after Dillon Gabriel exited with a concussion, and the results were rough. The rookie finished just 4-of-16 for 47 yards and an interception, struggling to find any rhythm against a tough Baltimor defense.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he gets his first full start – and his first real opportunity to rewrite the narrative.\n \n\n   \n  For Sanders, it’s a chance to show the Raiders, and every team that passed on him in the draft (which is all other 31 franchises considering he was selected with the 155th pick in the 4th round), that they misjudged him. For the Browns, it’s yet another hope that maybe this time they’ve found a spark.\n \n\n   \n    Niners-Panthers take the MNF stage\n \n\n   \n  Monday Night Football brings a sneaky-important NFC matchup: the 7-4 San Francisco 49ers hosting the 6-5 Carolina Panthers.\n \n\n   \n  Brock Purdy returned from his toe injury last week and hardly missed a beat, throwing 19-of-26 for 200 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-22 win over Arizona. With the NFC wild card picture tightening, this one carries real postseason weight.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco’s path is tougher – the NFC West has been the best division in football with the Los Angeles Rams (8-2), Seattle Seahawks (7-3), and Niners (7-4) all above water.\n \n\n   \n  The Panthers are coming off a huge overtime win in Atlanta that saw Bryce Young throw for a career-high 448 yards. He could be in for another big game as the Niners’ banged up secondary gives up the  fifth-most passing yards per game  in the league.\n \n\n   \n  And here’s your weird stat of the week: the Panthers are 6-0 when winning the coin toss and 0-5 when losing it. So, we may know how this one goes before the ball ever leaves the tee.\n \n\n   \n    Full NFL Week 12 schedule\n \n\n   \n   Away @ home \n \n\n   \n   Thursday \n \n\n   \n  Buffalo Bills @ Houston Texans, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Sunday \n \n\n   \n  Indianapolis Colts @ Kansas City Chiefs, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Seattle Seahawks @ Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Vikings @ Green Bay Packers, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Jets @ Baltimore Ravens, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New York Giants @ Detroit Lions, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh Steelers @ Chicago Bears, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Cleveland Browns @ Las Vegas Raiders, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville Jaguras @ Arizona Cardinals, 4:05 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Philadelphia Eagles @ Dallas Cowboys, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints, 4:25 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n  Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Los Angeles Rams, 8:20 p.m. ET\n \n\n   \n   Monday \n \n\n   \n  Carolina Panthers @ San Francisco 49ers, 8:15 p.m. ET\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/economy/us-jobs-report-september-final","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-05:00","title":"U.S. Economy Adds 119,000 Jobs in September, Unemployment Rises to Four-Year High","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, surpassing expectations and showing a rebound after a period of job losses in June and August, but unemployment rose to a nearly four-year high, indicating a fragile labor market.

jobs in September, but unemployment rose to a nearly four-year high \n       \n  By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A  long-awaited jobs report  offered a mixed picture of the US labor market.\n \n\n   \n  The economy added 119,000 jobs in September, an unexpected rebound for the labor market — but it comes as the overall economy shows signs of slowing.\n \n\n   \n  Economists were expecting 50,000 jobs to have been added and an unemployment rate that remained at 4.3%, according to FactSet.\n \n\n   \n  Delayed for seven weeks due to the government shutdown, the latest snapshot of America’s job market showed that unemployment rose in September to the highest level in nearly four years.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, August’s tepid job gains of 22,000 were revised to a job loss of 4,000 jobs and July was revised down by 7,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The health care and social assistance sector continued to drive overall employment growth. Those sectors added an estimated 57,100 jobs in September, accounting for nearly half of the overall gains. Leisure and hospitality contributed 47,000 jobs during a month with unseasonably warm weather.\n \n\n   \n  Jobs were lost in sectors such as transportation and warehousing (-25,300), temporary help services (-15,900) and manufacturing (-6,000).\n \n\n   \n  Although the September employment data has been on the shelf since early October,  it provides a critical snapshot  of the labor market at a time when tariffs, stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates continue to slow the US economy.\n \n\n   \n    Summer of job losses\n \n\n   \n  Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November. The BLS on Wednesday announced that there will not be a separate October jobs report published but instead some of that data will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stronger-than-expected September gains, this year is still on pace for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “The job market was really weak in the summer, and it didn’t improve much in September,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Credit Union. “What we learned today is that both June and August had negative job growth, so, shedding jobs; 119,000 is pretty good for September, but when you step back, the average (monthly job gain) of the past four months is in the low 40,000s.”\n \n\n   \n  “So, it looks very weak,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Unemployment, a closely watched recession indicator, ticked higher in September, rising to the highest rate since October 2021.\n \n\n   \n  However, driving the jobless rate higher was an increase in the labor force – primarily an uplift in more people looking for work, versus a sharp increase in layoffs, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n    Low-fire, low-hire, low-opportunity market\n \n\n   \n  The job gains remain heavily concentrated. Two sectors – health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality – accounted for 87% of September’s job growth.\n \n\n   \n  But in a labor market that’s been in a low-hire, low-fire slog, there are also few opportunities for those seeking work. On average, it’s taking people six months to find work, according to the latest BLS data.\n \n\n   \n  The latest unemployment claims data supports that trend: In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that an estimated 1.974 million people filed continuing claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended November 8, hitting a fresh four-year high.\n \n\n   \n  Initial claims, which are considered the best proxy for layoff activity, fell to 220,000 last week, remaining well below more concerning thresholds (300,000 to 400,000 range, consistently).\n \n\n   \n  “If I had to characterize it, it still looks a lot like ‘no-hire, no-fire,’” Long said. “I do worry, given the number of industries that are starting to fire, that this is starting to look like ‘no-hire, start-to-fire.’”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Cold water’ for a Fed cut\n \n\n   \n  Despite the mixed bag of data, the September report “could throw cold water” on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates further when it meets in December, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, wrote in a note on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “The sharp rebound in employment gains, up 119,000 in September following the downwardly revised negative 4,000 print in August soothes concerns that the labor market was on the precipice of a large downturn and removes urgency for another rate cut,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Still, because of the historic government shutdown, the September jobs report will be the freshest official monthly employment snapshot available when the Fed makes its next interest rate decision on December 10. The partial October and full November data won’t come out until the following week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/transgender-ideology-gender-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00.000-05:00","title":"The White House wants to eliminate ‘gender ideology’ and ‘trans ideology.’ What does that mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the rise and consequences of the political movement to eliminate 'gender ideology' and 'transgender ideology' in the U.S., particularly under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Asmelash, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Last week, the board of regents of the Texas A&M University System  voted to forbid professors  from teaching courses that “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” without advance permission from their university’s president. It was the newest escalation in a running conflict that began when a student in a summer course on children’s literature recorded video of herself accusing her professor of going “against our president’s laws” by teaching “gender ideology” and declared that she was reporting the purported violation to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Republican politicians seized on the video as a scandal, with one state representative calling it “TRANSGENDER INDOCTRINATION.” The Trump administration joined in, with Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon calling it  “deeply concerning”  and declaring she would look into it. Within days, the professor had been  fired , students led academic freedom  protests , and the president of the system’s flagship university  resigned  for reasons unspecified — all in the wake of a controversy about whether a class about children’s literature could legally discuss a children’s book about a 12-year-old coming out as nonbinary.\n \n\n   \n  In the past year, the terms “gender ideology” and its sibling, “transgender ideology,” have become ubiquitous — in government documents and policy announcements, in mass media and in online disputes. The White House has declared its intention to stamp them out. Yet what do they mean, exactly?\n \n\n   \n    Donald Trump demands ‘biological truth’\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, North Carolina passed the law HB2, colloquially known as the “Bathroom Bill,” banning people from using public restrooms that did not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The backlash was immediate: advocates nationwide sprang into action against it, the general public was appalled, the state lost  millions of dollars  in business and the NCAA pulled its high-profile sporting events. One year later, the bill was repealed.\n \n\n   \n  Yet less than a decade later, restrictions on transgender people have taken hold of state and national policy. While HB2 was viewed by some as a blatant form of transgender discrimination, similar mandates are being imposed and upheld by every level of government today.\n \n\n   \n  On President Donald Trump’s first day in office this year, he signed an executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” In it, he ordered the federal government to replace the term “gender” with “sex” throughout its policies and documents and declared that “sex” referred to “an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.”\n \n\n   \n  “Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex,” the  executive order read . “Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”\n \n\n   \n  Zaya Perysian, however, said Trump’s order brought a new and dangerous inconsistency to her life. Under the new White House rules, Perysian, a content creator who has documented her transition online, was issued a passport that identifies her as male, the sex she was assigned at birth. This left Perysian — with her chest-length curls and low-cut clothes, after more than five years on estrogen and both top and bottom surgery — holding a government ID that didn’t match her other legal documents. All the passport does, she said, is put her at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re 1% of the population and 90% of the conversation,” Perysian said. “It’s just so ridiculous. We’re always being forced to defend ourselves against complete nonsense and complete propaganda.”\n \n\n   \n    Finding ideology everywhere\n \n\n   \n  The term “gender ideology” didn’t originate in the US. The phrase has been part of a larger  anti-gender movement  taking shape across the world — first in Europe in the 2010s and now in Latin America, Africa and the US — particularly among conservative governments, religious groups and civil society groups, according to  a United Nations report . In 2018, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro centered  his right-wing election campaign against  “gender ideology.” Brazil is one of the  deadliest countries  for transgender people.\n \n\n   \n  The worldwide movement against “gender ideology” views the use of the term “gender” in classifying people’s social identities as a way to “destroy the traditional family and family values,” the UN report states. Indeed, much of the opposition is framed as a religious, moral choice: When Bolsonaro visited the White House  in 2019 , he decried “gender ideology” by saying both countries share a “respect to traditional and family lifestyles, respect to God, our creator, against the gender ideology of the politically correct attitudes and fake news.”\n \n\n   \n  “Transgender ideology,” a phrase largely used in the US, is, if anything, even more amorphous. Trump, in various public remarks or executive orders, has vowed to “get  transgender ideology  the hell out of our military,” to stop child abuse by “prohibiting public schools from indoctrinating our children with  transgender ideology ,” and to undo what he called the Biden administration’s efforts to “force Christians to affirm radical  transgender ideology .” During the investigation of the killing of Charlie Kirk, law enforcement leaked a preliminary internal report to the media incorrectly claiming the shooter’s ammunition had been marked with “ transgender ideology .”\n \n\n   \n  The president and his followers now use “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology” more or less interchangeably. A scroll through social media shows both phrases cropping up in conservative and right-wing corners of the internet, largely as a shorthand for anything pertaining to transgender people. Using a transgender person’s  correct pronouns ? That’s transgender ideology. A Glamour magazine cover  celebrating transgender women ? Also transgender ideology.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes, the content of the “ideology” isn’t even stated. Florida’s commissioner of education removed a sociology professor from a curriculum workgroup for “promoting gender ideology,” he announced on X, without ever specifying how  that ideology had actually been promoted . His replies were filled with hundreds of thank yous anyway.\n \n\n   \n    What makes trans people a unique target\n \n\n   \n  Jay W. Richards is a director at The Heritage Foundation and a contributor to the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025, who wrote about “gender ideology” back in 2023. That people can be divided into two sexes, male or female, is a matter of “biological reality,” he said — though biological research on sex distinctions has yielded  more complicated results . Richards described “gender ideology” as “toxic,” saying it causes people to misunderstand who they are. Having a subjective, internal sense of gender, he told CNN, should not constitute one’s literal identity. Those who are questioning their gender need help “to understand their bodily reality.”\n \n\n   \n  The goal, he said, is to successfully “defeat gender ideology.”\n \n\n   \n  “Say, 25 years from now, it never occurred to a child that he or she might be born in the wrong body, that to be whole, he or she needs to take body and mind-altering drugs and undergo radical surgery in order to be whole,” Richards said.\n \n\n   \n  That goal goes against the advice of major medical organizations. The American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support what they call  gender-affirming care  — a multidisciplinary approach that includes medically necessary and scientific evidence-based practices that has been shown to be  life-saving for transgender people. \n \n\n   \n  Yet more than half of US states have banned  some care for transgender youth  including puberty blockers, other hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgery (although research shows such surgeries are  rarely performed on minors  in the US).\n \n\n   \n  By using “gender ideology” and “transgender ideology,” people are explicitly trying to diminish the human nature of gender identity, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician and former director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  “They want it to be like, this person isn’t a transgender person, they’re an ideologue,” he said. “These are not evidence and science-based things that they’re saying. They’re really trying to destabilize the base of science that brought us to the place where gender diversity was something that we were supporting for people’s health.”\n \n\n   \n  In most other areas of medical care, it’s a generally accepted premise that people and their doctors make decisions together. When it comes to questions like avoiding vaccination, the Trump administration encourages people to follow their subjective beliefs, even amid rampant disinformation and, in some cases, limited access. Yet the government’s program of fighting “trans ideology” means that trans people are excluded from those principles — along with everyday principles like “ call people what they want to be called ” and “don’t  fire people from their jobs  because of their personal identity.”\n \n\n   \n  The usage casts transgender and nonbinary people as having succumbed to an undefined doctrine, rather than experiencing a differing gender identity. Trans personhood isn’t an identity, these terms suggest, it’s a belief imposed on people by outside ideological forces. And those forces, those so-called ideologies, can be overturned.\n \n\n   \n  “When you make our existence into an ideology, it becomes much easier to dismiss us than it is if you approach us as people,” said Laurel Powell, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Ban gender, spread measles\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the language is “demonizing transgender people as a group,” said Chase Strangio, attorney and co-director of the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project. Using this rhetoric suggests that people’s identities are an ideological threat to a country’s national order.\n \n\n   \n  “Part of what’s happening here is, ‘Oh, the world is changing in scary ways. It’s a threat to the order,’” Strangio said. “‘Gender ideology is at the root. We’re going to root it out.’”\n \n\n   \n  The effects of this rooting out are already seen. Already, between May 2024 and May 2025, hate attacks against transgender people increased by 14% compared with the year before, according  to GLAAD data . More than half of all anti-LGBTQ incidents tracked over the year targeted transgender and gender diverse people specifically. Political rhetoric can have potentially deadly effects.

 \n  By Adam Cancryn, Evan Perez, Kristen Holmes, Kaitlan Collins, Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  on Wednesday sought to bring a swift end to perhaps the most damaging saga of his term,  signing a measure  compelling the release of the Epstein files after losing a monthslong, tooth-and-nail fight to prevent their disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  The decision represents a stunning reversal for the president aimed chiefly at quelling a brewing GOP revolt and restoring his iron grip over the party. But few believe the path will be so easy from here.\n \n\n   \n  “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES,” Trump posted on Truth Social late in the day, framing the overwhelming votes for it in Congress as a result of his involvement.\n \n\n   \n  The measure becoming law is now set to open a fraught new stage in  the push for the files  tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, putting the Justice Department under fresh scrutiny and testing the White House’s ability to pivot attention away from the president’s past dealings with Epstein and toward more advantageous political ground.\n \n\n   \n  At an unrelated press conference earlier Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi would only say that the Justice Department would “follow the law” when asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  But already, officials face growing suspicion from Capitol Hill and their MAGA base that the administration will use a just-opened, Trump-ordered criminal investigation as an excuse to keep some of the Epstein case file under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  Justice officials, meanwhile, are scrambling to balance their probe with a looming December deadline for releasing the documents after being caught off-guard by both Trump’s demand for a new investigation and his subsequent sudden support Sunday evening for making all the Epstein files public, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  And even as the White House tries to accelerate past the controversy to focus on next year’s midterm elections, there remains little sign that Trump’s supporters are anywhere near ready to leave it behind.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a storyline that’s going to continue to dog the president into the second year of his presidency,” said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP operative. “The Epstein conspiracies have reached moon landing status. And we’ll never stop talking about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The relentless intrigue surrounding the Epstein files marks the rare issue that has driven a wedge between Trump and the Republican Party he’s led for the last decade, exposing a vulnerability for the White House made all the more frustrating by the fact that it’s largely the result of a series of self-inflicted wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Since it became clear that he could not suppress the files’ release, Trump has tried to reunify the GOP behind a new effort to tie Epstein directly to the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  In announcing he’d signed the bill, Trump focused squarely on Democrats, writing, “Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed,” and adding, “This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have!”\n \n\n   \n  The offensive has drawn on newly disclosed Epstein emails that mention various prominent Democrats, alongside numerous references to Trump — a development that White House officials hope will put them back on offense after months under siege. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there’s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein’s wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  “All of a sudden there existed a real opportunity to change the narrative,” one official told CNN, noting that aides had only limited knowledge of what was in the documents compiled by Epstein’s estate until a House committee released them last week.   \n \n\n   \n  But the strategic shift comes after months of failed gambits, dismissals and outright resistance to releasing the files — all of which has sapped precious attention and time from the administration’s core agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The president now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of his term so far, as well as the twin challenges of waging an uphill battle toward the midterms while keeping a lid on the simmering divisions over Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president was in the right position at the end,” GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said of his support for the Epstein measure. “The rest of the story now is that they will have to deliver on that package in very short order, and then it’s going to depend upon what’s in the package and what’s been withheld.”\n \n\n   \n    Pressure for the files was a problem of Trump’s own making\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s signature on the bill — and the credit he claimed for its success — capped a public push for the files that the president himself first fueled nearly a year-and-a-half ago, after he pledged on the campaign trail to release the materials if elected.\n \n\n   \n  His team then leaned into that off-hand commitment   as a way to energize a segment of the GOP base that’s been fixated on the Epstein files and has been convinced they would implicate a range of powerful figures in the late financier’s sexual abuse of young girls.\n \n\n   \n  The administration further heightened expectations in February, when Bondi distributed “Epstein Files” binders to conservative influencers at the White House. The event was a dud; virtually all of the information was already public, sparking public backlash and opening the door to months of private tensions among top DOJ officials.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later claimed the administration was poring over newer materials, only for the DOJ to announce months later that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”\n \n\n   \n  The ensuing firestorm pitted the White House against many of the MAGA figures who had aided Trump’s rise, sparked a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to force the release of the files and prompted an internal scramble to tamp down an issue that threatened to consume the administration through much of the summer.\n \n\n   \n  That effort became more challenging in the wake of revelations that magnified Trump’s past connections to Epstein, including that the president’s name had surfaced in the files. (Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, aides sought to manage the expectations of their allies, trying to explain that publicizing the rest of the files risked harming victims and violating the privacy of people whose names were in the documents but not credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly took to social media to try to browbeat Republicans in line, insisting that the files he once vowed to release were now little more than a Democratic “hoax.” Yet neither approach succeeding in quelling the calls for more disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to explain to people that they’re believing in something that does not exist,” a senior White House official said. “That’s why it’s so frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n    New investigation raises fresh questions about what will be released\n \n\n   \n  At one point, as the congressional effort to compel the Epstein files’ release gained steam, officials floated launching the new DOJ investigation as a way to alleviate the pressure and block any more documents from being released, an administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not clear whether the option made it to Trump. A White House official said the idea of an investigation into Democrats came after the emails were released by the House oversight panel last week. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday’s unrelated press conference, Bondi said that “new information” obtained by investigators had prompted her to reopen the Epstein matter without specifying what that was.\n \n\n   \n  So last Friday, as the House vote on releasing the files loomed, Trump abruptly called for the DOJ to probe Epstein’s connections to a handful of Democrat-aligned figures including former President Bill Clinton. He also sought an inquiry into the banking giant JPMorgan Chase’s associations with Epstein.   (Responding to the probe, spokespeople for Clinton and JPMorgan maintained they were not involved in Epstein’s crimes.)\n \n\n   \n  The White House insists Trump has always been on the side of releasing the files. “President Trump has never been against releasing the Epstein files — rather, he has always been against Republicans falling into the Democrat trap of talking about this rather than focusing on the historic tax cuts signed into law, the fact that zero illegal aliens have entered our country in five months, and the many other accomplishments of the Trump Administration on behalf of the American people,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  And since the opening of the new investigation, multiple White House officials have insisted to CNN that Trump will not stand in the way of the documents being released and that aides have little reason to believe the new investigation will affect that process, though Bondi declined to offer any explicit assurances on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Within the DOJ, some officials have lamented that Trump’s novel support for releasing the files amounts to a lose-lose — with Bondi and her department now facing dueling directives to both run an investigation and make public its pertinent documents.\n \n\n   \n  The White House’s belated bid now to lean into the Epstein files as a political attack line has also generated some grumbling among allies on Capitol Hill and in the broader Trump orbit who had hoped to move on from a challenging period.\n \n\n   \n  In the last two weeks, some of these allies noted, Trump oversaw an end to the record-long government shutdown, promoted the administration’s efforts on key affordability issues and hosted a series of high-profile diplomatic events.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as Trump and his aides try to turn the tables on Democrats over Epstein, “this is all anyone’s talking about,” Conant said.\n \n\n   \n  “The power of the presidency is the ability to set the agenda,” he added. “And to the extent that this is a distraction, it does undermine what else he can do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/africa/nnamdi-kanu-terrorism-conviction-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-05:00","title":"Nigerian Court Convicts Separatist Leader Kanu for Terrorism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Nigerian court has convicted separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu on all seven terrorism-related charges after a decade-long legal battle, citing his broadcasts and directives to the banned Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group as inciting deadly violence.

At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.\n \n\n   \n  What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the  Golden State Killer .\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s. In April 2018, nearly four decades after his last known crimes, police armed with DNA evidence surrounded his house in the quiet Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights and arrested him.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in a T-shirt, cargo shorts and tube socks, a shocked DeAngelo offered no resistance when detectives moved in after he stepped into his yard. In a jarring contrast to the cruelty he once inflicted, the predator who’d terrorized residents in 11 counties did not fight back. But he protested in a high-pitched voice, ‘I have a roast in the oven!’”\n \n\n   \n  Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.\n \n\n   \n  “He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “ The People vs. the Golden State Killer. ” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.\n \n\n   \n  DeAngelo was convicted of multiple murders in August 2020 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n \n\n   \n    Why do you think DeAngelo shut down in the hours after his arrest?\n \n\n   \n  He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t realize that his mental defense didn’t work, because this isn’t the first time he tried it. In 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer, he was caught by store security, and he was acting like he was crazy, mumbling to himself, saying crazy things. And when the police came, he admitted he was pretending to be crazy, hoping that security wouldn’t call them. He has used this technique of pretending to be crazy, so we knew it was fake.\n \n\n   \n    At the beginning of his crime spree, he was a police officer, even working on task forces hunting him. Did that help him evade capture?\n \n\n   \n  It did. The first series of crimes, he was the Visalia Ransacker from 1974 to 1975. There were 120 burglaries in a three-mile square radius. It turned out he was a police officer in a nearby town, and he was on the task force to find the Visalia Ransacker, and he was the ransacker. He left Visalia in central California and moved up to Sacramento, where he started committing rapes there. As a police officer, he knew how everything operated, how long it took to respond to the scene, where they would set up their blockades and how to get around that. He used his expert knowledge as a police officer to commit his crimes, find his victims and then escape.\n \n\n   \n    What drove his escalation from voyeurism and burglary to rape and murder?\n \n\n   \n  It was that insatiable appetite for power.\n \n\n   \n  When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.\n \n\n   \n  And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.\n \n\n   \n  And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.\n \n\n   \n    Some of the survivors made their voices heard in court. How did you track them down decades later and prepare them to testify?\n \n\n   \n  After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.\n \n\n   \n  We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.\n \n\n   \n    Your book focuses more on the survivors and law enforcement officials than on the killer himself. What was the reasoning behind that approach?\n \n\n   \n  A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.\n \n\n   \n  During the impact statement, she says, ‘I’ve brought somebody here with me today that was also a victim, and her name is Bonnie.’ And Bonnie comes up. And Bonnie was actually engaged to DeAngelo about 40 years ago but had broken up with him.\n \n\n   \n  And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.\n \n\n   \n  Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’\n \n\n   \n  It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n    His crimes were horrifying. Is there a particular survivor whose story has stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  When I think about the case now, I don’t think about him or the crimes. I think about the survivors. One of them, Phyllis Hennemann, was the very first rape victim in Sacramento. She was diagnosed with cancer, and when it was time for court she couldn’t be there because she was having chemo. But when DeAngelo was sentenced, I looked across the courtroom, and there’s Phyllis sitting there. And she had this twinkle on her eye. For the first time in 40 years, she got justice. About three months later, she died from cancer. I think about her a lot … that we were able to get her that justice.\n \n\n   \n    After four decades, was there a moment in the investigation that marked a turning point?\n \n\n   \n  DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.\n \n\n   \n  And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.\n \n\n   \n    Having seen the evidence up close, which details have stayed with you?\n \n\n   \n  The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.\n \n\n   \n    Do you believe there are more victims out there?\n \n\n   \n  I do. His last known crime was the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz in Orange County. People ask me, ‘Why did he stop in 1986’? And my answer is, ‘How do you know he stopped in 1986?’\n \n\n   \n  There’s a three-year period from 1986 to 1989, when he was living in LA, that we’re not sure exactly where he was and what he was doing. And he was already beginning to evolve as a killer. So what’s to say he didn’t continue to kill his victims, but he discarded the bodies somewhere that we never found?\n \n\n   \n    You describe justice in this case as not just a legal victory but a personal, full-circle moment for you. Why?\n \n\n   \n  I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.\n \n\n   \n    What’s DeAngelo’s life like in prison today?\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.\n \n\n   \n  So he’s in his own version of hell, where he belongs.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/charlotte-ice-raids-residents-mobilizing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Volunteer Patrols and the PTA at School Entrances: How Some Charlotte Residents Are Mobilizing Amid the Immigration Crackdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a federal immigration crackdown known as 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' Charlotte residents have mobilized through volunteer patrols, school guard programs, and community alerts.

Volunteer patrols and the PTA at school entrances: How some Charlotte residents are mobilizing amid the immigration crackdown \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Andy Buck, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The pews of the Charlotte church were packed as onlookers watched a man restrain a woman while a group in bright vests furiously blew their whistles and filmed the interaction, chanting, “La migra esta aqui.”\n \n\n   \n  Another group loudly sang, “This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.”\n \n\n   \n  Clapping then erupted from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  The scene was among several role-play scenarios hundreds watched Wednesday evening at Dilworth United Methodist Church as part of a training on how to respond to the expanding federal immigration enforcement operation that has  gripped the Charlotte area  and left residents on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s practice our whistling language,” Rev. Joel Simpson, a pastor at First United Methodist Church in Taylorsville, said before a dissonant symphony of whistles filled the church.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to report active operations that are happening in our city, alert people nearby and offer reminders of our rights,” Simpson, who led the training, told the crowd. “We’re going to document and record unlawful practices, and we’re going to deter violence by getting as many people as possible to join quickly as an organized presence.”\n \n\n   \n  The plan is simple: Volunteers sign up for shifts and receive instructions from a “patrol dispatch team” on specific zones in Charlotte they will drive around in and alert people when they see immigration enforcement activity. They’re advised to do it in pairs, keep a safe distance from agents and to never try to physically impede law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative is just one of many launched by Charlotte residents to help immigrant neighbors as the Trump administration touts  over 250 arrests  in the area since the aggressive immigration crackdown began over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Parents are banding together to guard school entrances or carpool students to class, and business owners across the city are patrolling their neighborhoods and closing their doors to protect their customers.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  have been  using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico were seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the fear throughout the city is palpable: families are keeping their children home from school and taking off from work, worrying they’ll be targeted by federal immigration agents.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Loving your neighbors is holy’\n \n\n   \n  Immigrant worker group Siembra NC organized Wednesday’s event at the church to train volunteers to help immigrants safely get to school and work and guard against constitutional violations during immigration enforcement activities, according to the organization.\n \n\n   \n  Volunteers stood outside the church doors, passing out warning whistles and held signs saying “Loving your neighbors is holy.”\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of volunteers have attended training sessions held by the group to help immigrants as they travel within the city, document and record “unlawful practices” by agents and warn about enforcement activity, Simpson said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re coming out on weeknights and they’re saying this is how we need to be spending our time and we want to be on the streets and in our communities, making sure people are cared for,” Simpson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Over 1,000 people registered for Wednesday’s training and some people had to be turned away, the pastor said.\n \n\n   \n  Simpson said they got “best practices” from other communities that have been stops in the administration’s immigration blitz, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “People are telling me as they go through this training like, ‘I’m feeling empowered,’” he said. “‘I feel like I can do something and there’s a way to channel my love and my anger and my fear into something that supports other people.’”\n \n\n   \n  That was the case for Maria Klein, who has used the training as a way to channel her frustration about the crackdown in her city.\n \n\n   \n  She attended the training because she cares about “our children who should be able to go to school safely, for our parents who should be able to go to work for the American dream.” Klein, who teaches English as a Second Language to adults, says many of her students have stopped attending class.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an opportunity to really do something practical and to have an immediate impact,” Klein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Parents and teachers help families as school attendance plummets\n \n\n   \n  “What is gonna happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?”\n \n\n   \n  “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”\n \n\n   \n  These are the questions teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN she has been getting from students at Charlotte East Language Academy since the immigration crackdown began in the city.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell them that I’m gonna fight if someone comes to my door. I’m fighting – hands, feet, it doesn’t matter. You’re not coming in my classroom and taking any of my kids,” Roldan said. “My classroom is a safe space and it will stay that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Amid “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – the immigration enforcement operation in the city named after the classic 1952 children’s book – more than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  “We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders   hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools teacher David Gillespie says hallways and classrooms were nearly empty on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate  WCNC . “Whether because their parents were involved in detainments or because their parents have to make that unfortunate safety calculus — is it worth it to send my kids to school and put myself at risk?”\n \n\n   \n  As attendance plummets, some parents in the district are organizing to help families who are afraid to leave their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Some PTA members are standing guard at school entrances during drop-off and pick-up so they can alert staff and families if they see federal immigration agents, WCNC reported. Others are passing out information packets and using PTA funds to help families experiencing food insecurity or transportation issues.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re standing there bearing witness and being part of the community,” PTA member Amy Hawnelson told WCNC. “They do not stick around — and that’s why we’re here.”\n \n\n   \n  Another member, Mike Mastry, said they want to help students feel safe at school.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing a familiar face that’s friendly and smiling helps bring a sense of normalcy,” Mastry told WCNC. “When kids don’t know what’s going on, they get disoriented and have trouble learning.”\n \n\n   \n  Roldan said parents with legal status are picking up children whose parents may not have legal status to bring them to school.\n \n\n   \n  Gillespie says he’s reaching out to families to help students stay on top of schoolwork.\n \n\n   \n  Extracurriculars have been impacted by the operation too. OurBRIDGE, an organization that helps newly arrived immigrant children and their families, has suspended its afterschool programs after Border Patrol activity at one of its sites, the group  announced  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, photos of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n  “The students’ main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the demonstration said.\n \n\n   \n    Business owners work to protect customers\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte business owner Bryan Li enrolled in a training session offered by a local advocacy group and has been out patrolling the city the past few days, looking for federal agents and reporting back to advocacy groups that alert the community.\n \n\n   \n  Li, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, told CNN he couldn’t sit at home and not do something.\n \n\n   \n  “When harm is done, more people rally, learn and prepare so we can help protect our most vulnerable,” Li told CNN. “Charlotte will stand united and protect our immigrant community with everything we have.”\n \n\n   \n  While people like Li patrol the city, many businesses have shuttered their doors, fearing their customers will be a target.\n \n\n   \n  About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. Community members showed up afterwards to guard the business.\n \n\n   \n  Beth Clements, who stood outside the bakery wearing a yellow vest, had been standing guard there for three days.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to walk the streets with my whistle and I want to keep my neighbors protected because they deserve protection and they deserve to live in a world where they’re not scared,” Clements said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/israeli-hostage-kupershtein-gaza-captivity-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"In your head, you count every day: Ex-October 7 hostage describes 2 years in captivity","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bar Kupershtein, a 23-year-old Israeli security guard, was kidnapped during a Hamas attack at the Nova Festival on October 7, 2023.

your head, you count every day’: Ex-October 7 hostage describes 2 years in captivity \n       \n  By Tal Shalev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Bar Kupershtein smiles and laughs as if he hasn’t spent the last two years in “hell,” as he describes it, his demeanor belying the time he spent  in Hamas’ captivity in Gaza .\n \n\n   \n  “I prefer to take things with humor and laughter, to be happy with my family, and to look forward, not back,” the 23-year-old security guard who was kidnapped from  the Nova Festival on October 7, 2023 , told CNN, hours before boarding a flight to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the same resolve that made him stay behind during the terror attack, aiding the wounded partygoers, until he was ultimately shot and kidnapped by Hamas. Despite the enormous hardship he endured, he says he would do the exact same thing again.\n \n\n   \n  “I was responsible for the safety of all the partygoers”’ he said. “If I ran away and saved myself, knowing that others were there and I could have helped them –– I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.” Survivors have called him a hero. “I just did my job,” he insists.\n \n\n   \n  That decision cost him 738 days.\n \n\n   \n  “In your head, you count every day, that’s how you keep yourself busy,” he told CNN. In the beginning, he recalls, blindfolded and forbidden from speaking, counting was one of the only activities available. Days became weeks, months, two years.\n \n\n   \n  “There were moments when they tried to execute us, when they starved us, when they abused us, whether with beatings, physically, verbally, depriving us from basic human conditions,” he recounts. “You feel like the most miserable person in the world.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Just endure it’ or ‘It can’t get any worse than this’\n \n\n   \n  Held underground with five other hostages, in what he described as “a small dungeon,” Kupershtein recalls an especially violent period, following statements by far-right  Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir  on Palestinian prisoners. “They came to us, beat us and hit us, and when we asked why, they said it was because of Ben Gvir and because of our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2025, Hamas released  a propaganda video  showing Kupershtein and another hostage, Maxim Herkin, appearing emaciated and distressed, begging to be brought home. “All I was thinking about was that my family would know that I am alive, that’s it,” he said. “I didn’t care what they told me to say, I would say everything – just for my family to see me safe and sound and speaking.”\n \n\n   \n  In that hell, Kupershtein says his anchor was his faith.\n \n\n   \n  “God gave me the strength to be strong. I truly believed and knew that I would get out safe and sound,” he said. “From day one, I had this inner feeling. I kept telling myself not to give up and stay strong – for the family – because one day I will get out and go back to being Bar. I told myself that it can’t get any worse than this – so just endure it.”\n \n\n   \n  His faith grew even stronger during captivity.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t very religious beforehand, only traditional, but in captivity, one really connects to God, you talk to him. He saved me – not once or twice. Every day that I stayed alive was a miracle.”\n \n\n   \n  In captivity, Kupershtein had little access to the outside world and was only occasionally aware of what was happening. Even then, it was often what his captors wanted him to know.\n \n\n   \n  But a radio transmitter brought in to broadcast Quran passages to the hostages gave them an unexpected link to the outside.\n \n\n   \n  Kupershtein managed to locate an Israeli military radio station and get updates from home. “I remember waking up every morning, looking at the radio and waiting to listen to it,” he says. “It really is a miracle. Imagine you’re 30 meters (98 feet) underground and you’re listening to the radio.”\n \n\n   \n    A father’s fight for his son\n \n\n   \n  From that radio, he heard about his family’s efforts to secure his release. Kupershtein’s father, Tal, was a former volunteer paramedic for  United Hatzalah , Israel’s largest volunteer emergency medical service organization. He suffered a severe stroke in a motorcycle accident three years prior to the kidnapping. The accident made Bar, the eldest of five siblings, the family’s breadwinner, managing their falafel stand while also working as a security guard at events. He also followed in his father’s footsteps, volunteering as a paramedic.\n \n\n   \n  During his son’s captivity, Tal – who was in a wheelchair and had been unable to speak for years – engaged in an intense recovery effort with speech therapists and regained his ability to speak so he could advocate for his son’s freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw my father sometimes at demonstrations, they even brought me a picture of him standing at a demonstration,” Kupershtein says. “I also heard my mother organized a birthday for me at Hostages Square.”\n \n\n   \n  He didn’t believe his release was coming until the last minute. “There were so many deals that didn’t go through, so we thought here’s another one that won’t go through, something will mess up,” he said. “Even when I was on my way home, I didn’t believe we were actually getting out.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is on his way to the Oval Office, where the US president invited all 20 newly- freed hostages. Kupershtein, who calls Trump “an emissary of God,” plans first and foremost to thank him. “God said we needed to get out of there and he was the emissary,”, he says. “He played a big part in us getting out of there.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believes in peace, Kupershtein is measured. “Personally, yes, but after these two years I was there, I know that the other side is really not interested in peace, so as much as we as a state can want peace – I don’t think it can happen with Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  He describes himself now as an “upgraded version” of who he was before and says being back in Israel is like a daily dream.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an excitement every day to wake up in the morning here – and not there in the tunnels – and to be alive and breathing,” he said. “I thank God for this every day.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, underneath the smiles and the laughter, he acknowledged the wounds remain.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there are moments when I can’t fall asleep at night with hard thoughts and a need to go out for fresh air,” he admits. “Sometimes I find myself in situations where I see everyone around me happy, but I’m just regular, and it’s not true happiness.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he tries “to surround myself with a loving, supportive environment so that I don’t reach those situations and just be happy.

Tawfeeq and Ibrahim Dahman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli strikes across  Gaza  killed at least   32 Palestinians  in the latest escalation of violence since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 12 children and eight women were among those killed in the strikes, which continued from Wednesday into Thursday morning, while a further 88 people sustained injuries.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out the strikes on Hamas targets after “several terrorists” fired on Israeli soldiers operating in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement,” the IDF said, adding that none of its forces had been injured.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas condemned the strikes as “a dangerous escalation” and rejected the IDF’s account, accusing Israel of trying to “justify its ongoing crimes and violations.” It called on the US to exert “immediate, serious pressure” on Israel to “respect the ceasefire and halt the aggression against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest strikes bring the total Palestinian death toll since the ceasefire came into effect to 312.\n \n\n   \n  They come just days after the UN Security Council  endorsed  US President Donald Trump’s plan for how to move beyond the fragile truce to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in a separate development, Israel also carried out airstrikes on what it claimed were Hezbollah weapons storage sites in southern Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza were the third major escalation since the  ceasefire agreement  came into force in October, each preceded by an attack on Israeli soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  In the two previous escalations, on  October 19  and  28 , approximately 150 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were killed.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite those escalations the ceasefire has largely held.\n \n\n   \n  CNN footage taken Wednesday at Gaza City’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex shows dozens of people crowding around incoming ambulances carrying victims of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The footage shows several people sitting beside the corpses inside the hospital, some peering into the body bags in despair. One of the body bags contains the bodies of three lifeless children still covered in dust.\n \n\n   \n  The deadliest strike Wednesday was in the Zaytun area in the east of Gaza, where 10 people, including a woman and a child, were killed, Gaza Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  Another strike hit an area west of Khan Younis targeting “a group of civilians inside the UNRWA club,” the Civil Defense added.\n \n\n   \n  UNRWA is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage during an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, according to the Gaza health ministry, more than 69,000 Palestinians – most of them women and children – have been killed.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire framework, Hamas agreed to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza, living and dead, while Israel agreed to withdraw from some parts of Gaza and release some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has since released all of the living hostages and the bodies of all but three of the dead ones.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza come a day after an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in  Lebanon killed 13 people,  according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The IDF said Tuesday’s strike had targeted “a Hamas training compound” that was being used to “plan and carry out terrorist attacks against the IDF and the State of Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Israel carried out further strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting what it said were “several weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah’s rocket unit.” The strikes caused no casualties but damaged several houses, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has been carrying out strikes in  Lebanon targeting militants from Hezbollah  as well as various Palestinian militant factions for more than two years. These escalated after Iran-backed Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack. The latest strikes come despite a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah that took effect in November 2024.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Heather law contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/epstein-files-ro-khanna","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-05:00","title":"Ro Khanna explains how he helped engineer the vote that 'ripped MAGA apart'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from Silicon Valley, played a central role in engineering a bipartisan vote in the U.S. House to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, which passed with a 427-1 majority.

That’s a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was  perhaps the biggest defeat  of President Donald Trump’s second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”\n \n\n   \n  A group of Epstein’s survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn’t clear if he was acknowledging Khanna’s work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on  the discharge petition leading to Tuesday’s vote , were trending on X and he wasn’t. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Khanna doesn’t hide his belief that Tuesday’s triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on  legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia  for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.\n \n\n   \n  “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.\n \n\n   \n  “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?’ And it’s easier if you’re a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it’s not just ideas. I’m able to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are willing to give him credit too.\n \n\n   \n  “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we’re going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I’m used to fighting battles and not winning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He’s on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn’t for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don’t think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”\n \n\n   \n    How he strategized\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, a 49-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he’d like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.\n \n\n   \n  “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I’m not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of eggs?’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of health care?’ ‘What’s up with this?’ And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.’”\n \n\n   \n  That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she’d do it if she didn’t have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.\n \n\n   \n  To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who’ve rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”\n \n\n   \n  That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails  released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice  on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein’s final arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn’t respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna’s pushing the bill through.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who’s become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”\n \n\n   \n  “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Anger and regrets\n \n\n   \n  At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they’ve blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.\n \n\n   \n  He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn’t have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn’t have waited until Trump’s backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”\n \n\n   \n  Khanna’s father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don’t tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”\n \n\n   \n    A ‘proof of concept’\n \n\n   \n  Khanna doesn’t know if he’ll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn’t talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won’t be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors’ lawyers and former Justice officials who’ve seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire’s tax that they’ll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.\n \n\n   \n  “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,’ maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?’ This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Khanna’s age. He is 49, not 47.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/09/30/europe/tomahawk-missiles-trump-ukraine-180-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s latest policy 180 on the war in Ukraine could strike deep into Russian territory","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly considering supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, a dramatic policy reversal from earlier statements that Russia had 'no cards'.

strike deep into Russian territory \n       \n  Analysis by Nick Paton Walsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s such a stark change, it is perhaps forgivable the messaging is garbled.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump is considering supplying  Tomahawk missiles  to Ukraine, according to his Vice President JD Vance.\n \n\n   \n  “We are having conversations this very minute about that issue,” Vance told “Fox News Sunday,” adding Trump will make a “final determination.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the same day he believed Ukraine had the authorization to strike deep into Russia. “Use the ability to hit deep,” he said. “There are no such things as sanctuaries.” Kellogg later clarified his remarks as only referring to public statements from Vance and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and not a fresh insight into White House thinking. But Trump’s team are either seriously considering supplying Tomahawks – whose very nature means they are really only for long-range strikes into Russia – or they want everyone to think they are.\n \n\n   \n  Forty-three days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin was walking on a red carpet into The Beast in Alaska. But now the Kremlin are having to respond to the idea of the US’s most effective long-range missile being supplied to a foe that, only seven months ago, Trump said “had no cards.” Days after Trump’s Truth Social posting that Ukraine could take back all occupied territory, this is another policy 180, but one with long-range teeth.\n \n\n   \n  First made famous in the 1991 Gulf War, the Tomahawk is reserved for the US’s closest allies – including the United Kingdom and Japan. Its four models range up to the latest version, Block IV, which can feed back live information on targets below, permitting a change during flight. The US would not supply the weapons but instead sell them to Europe to pass on to Kyiv. But have no doubt, that will not allay Moscow’s concerns the Trump administration is massively escalating and improving Ukraine’s capabilities here.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said little about what he has called a “sensitive topic.” He knows Ukraine has already used long-range drones to damage Russia’s oil refineries to the point where gas shortages in the country are an established fact. Clearly, Kyiv is already able to strike deep into parts of Russia where the war was meant to be a distant thing the poor died fighting. They have shown ingenuity can supplant sheer might and technology, with the use of tiny drones hidden in container housing to strike Siberian airfields in Operation Spider Web. Yet Tomahawks would present a new order of challenge to Russia’s air defenses. Government buildings in Moscow and grandiose Ministry of Defense infrastructure could become open targets.\n \n\n   \n  Is the plan ahead for what tacticians call “strategic ambiguity”? To allow Ukraine’s growing long-range missile stock to claim responsibility for Tomahawk strikes, or even vice-versa? Debris from missiles will likely point to the true culprit. It is unlikely US involvement will stay hidden, and Moscow will be forced to try to respond in kind.\n \n\n   \n  But there are two moments in the past that perhaps help predict where this new threat of escalation is headed. The first is the last major weaponry boost for Ukraine from Washington – the Biden administration’s  decision to allow Kyiv to fire ATACMs  deep into Russia. Putin did respond, by firing the new-ish Oreshnik missile into Dnipro, at a mostly deserted warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  The device sounded terrifying – an apparently new, nuclear capable IRBM, fired with multiple conventional warheads, that the Kremlin boasted could rip through European defenses. Ukrainian experts claimed the device was a variation on an older model RS26, and showed me what looked like ageing valves in its circuitry at a storage facility in Kyiv. In short, it did not seem to be a huge technical leap forwards, or a staggering show of force, rather some mild nuclear-adjacent saber-rattling in response to an undeniable US escalation. The sheer paucity of Russian resources, after three and a half years of war, may lead to a similarly ineffective response to any use of Tomahawks.\n \n\n   \n  The second precedent is less in Ukraine’s favor. The last time the Trump administration threatened to escalate in a manner that would have outstripped its predecessor, was to implement secondary sanctions against India and China for buying Russian oil – in response to months of insincere Russian diplomacy. Such a broad imposition of tariffs would have been a fiercer move than any Joe Biden contemplated. Indeed, 50% tariffs are now in place against India. But Trump has demanded Europe quit buying Russian hydrocarbons if he is to go further. He has, thus far, held back.\n \n\n   \n  This may be the fate of the Tomahawk debate. That when it comes to Trump’s “final determination,” he follows his usual predisposition to pause the most destructive measures, and keep alive a relationship that appears enduring to the point of enigma – his friendship with Putin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/china/japan-china-taiwan-dispute-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:48:00-04:00","title":"China warns there is ‘no market’ for Japanese seafood exports as spat over Taiwan comments escalates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has warned that there is 'no market' for Japanese seafood exports due to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comments suggesting that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would threaten Japan’s survival, a statement China sees as a direct violation of its 'red line' on Taiwan’s sovereignty.

And I’m leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,” Greene told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n \n\n   \n    Some Democrats see opportunity\n \n\n   \n  In their pursuit of circumventing House GOP leadership to force a vote on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, Democrats found an unlikely ally in Greene.\n \n\n   \n  Even though virtually all Republicans ended up voting for the measure, Greene was one of only four Republicans to buck their party and sign onto the petition that made Tuesday’s vote possible. It culminated in a shared embrace with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, a key Democratic backer of the effort, at a high-profile press conference on Capitol Hill (once strangers,  the pair now texts ) and laid the groundwork for some Democrats to start to see an opening.\n \n\n   \n  Another area Democrats see as an opportunity to work together: The issue of rising health care costs and affordability.\n \n\n   \n  During the government shutdown, Greene openly vented about how health care prices for her family would double due to the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that were central to Democrats’ shutdown argument.\n \n\n   \n  “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene  wrote  on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Her criticisms reached the upper echelon of the House Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  The second highest Democrat in the House, Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, said she was open to working with Greene on lowering the cost of health care and cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hand is always extended in bipartisanship, and we will work with anyone that is going to prioritize the economic needs of families at home and reduce their costs,” Clark said.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s criticism of Israel in the war with Hamas has also brought her closer to some unexpected allies.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said that despite the pair’s charged history (Greene tried to censure Omar  last year ), she approached Greene on the House floor even prior to Greene’s  apparent political breakup  with Trump to thank her for speaking out on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “In regards to her stances and addressing the genocide, I have actually personally gone to thank her for that. I think it is important when somebody is doing a principled thing that we thank them for what they are doing,” Omar said of her conversation with Greene a few months ago.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal has even gone through the trouble of tracking down Greene’s cell phone number to thank her for being outspoken against Trump and the Republican Party and wants to suggest teaming up on the progressive priority of “Medicare for All.” It wasn’t something she ever thought she’d do.\n \n\n   \n  “But I also have worked with a lot of people that I disagree with on a lot of things,” Jayapal told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Distrust remains\n \n\n   \n  Not all Democrats are quick to trust when it comes to the Georgia Republican, and some questioned the influence she has within her party to draw other Republicans to the table.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the progressive group known as “the Squad” who were often the subject of Greene’s most vile attacks said they needed to see evidence that Greene’s arc was real and not just a publicity stunt.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she needs to see Greene’s words followed up by action and that it’s on Greene to reach out to make amends.\n \n\n   \n  “I personally believe that you never close the door to a person who wants to have changes in their life and in their heart, but they have to be genuine and they have to be authentic,” the New York congresswoman said. “It is incumbent upon her to repair the harm that she has done to people. It is not on the people she has harmed.”\n \n\n   \n  As a candidate in 2020, Greene  posted  on her candidate Facebook page an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib and encouraged going on the “offense against these socialists.” Facebook took down the photo at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Ayanna Pressley remembers that photo, but says she would be willing to work with Greene if the Republican show true change.\n \n\n   \n  “I am a Christian woman of deep faith, so I certainly believe in the capacity of people to evolve, to atone, and to redeem themselves. And if she is on a path to do that, that is extraordinary. And I need to see action that supports what she’s saying,” the Massachusetts Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  “I never want to cause any harm or anything bad for anyone,” Greene told Bash on Sunday, saying she’d previously addressed her hateful comments.\n \n\n   \n  In  2021 , Greene also apologized for her offensive comments comparing Capitol Hill mask-wearing rules to the Holocaust after visiting the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Becca Balint who put forward a resolution censuring Greene in  2023 , arguing she’s “fanned the flames of racism, antisemitism, LGBTQ hate speech, Islamophobia, anti-Asian hate, xenophobia, and other forms of hatred,” said Greene will need to be proactive if she is serious about making a change.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know politics always makes for strange bedfellows. In this instance, though, it has been truly remarkable and shocking to see her change of heart regarding nasty rhetoric. The only way for this to be anything other than just platitudes is for her to truly make amends to all the colleagues she’s hurt and put in danger,” Balint said.\n \n\n   \n  If Greene were serious about showing her evolution many Democrats argued a great place for her to start would be supporting a congressional memorial to honor law enforcement caught in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, who formerly served on the January 6 select committee, said Greene having dismissed the violence that day and refused to accept Joe Biden as the rightful winner of the 2020 election make it hard for him to conceive of working directly with her.\n \n\n   \n  “Her positions on January 6th and supporting the ‘Big Lie,’ you know, would continue to be an issue. It’s not someone I choose to cosponsor legislation with,” Aguilar said. “But I appreciate that people evolve on certain issues and if she wants to work with us on health care issues, then I welcome that.”\n \n\n   \n    Relationships after Trump\n \n\n   \n  Part of the calculus for Democrats is that they want to show the capacity to forgive Republicans who are starting to grapple with what the future of their party looks like in a world where Trump will no longer be the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland went as far as to say the Democratic Party has a big enough tent that Greene could one day be a part of.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, Marjorie Taylor Greene would have a lot of political transformation to go through before she could come to the Democratic Party, but I do want to make the serious point that we have to be open to a lot of people who are refugees from the political corruption and authoritarianism of the Republican Party,” Raskin told CNN. “I hear from Republicans every day who say, ‘I can’t take it anymore.’”\n \n\n   \n  A senior House Democratic aide, pressed on the idea of Greene one day becoming a Democrat, quipped that “converts are the most devout.”\n \n\n   \n  But even the Democrats who see the capacity for forgiveness acknowledge that it’s a long road ahead.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s got to do her own work. She’s on her own life journey,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/larry-summers-openai-board-epstein","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-05:00","title":"Larry Summers leaves OpenAI board, Harvard instructor role as scrutiny over Epstein emails intensifies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president, has resigned from the OpenAI board and stepped down from his instructor role at Harvard University following the release of emails by a U.S. House committee that reveal years of personal correspondence between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including sexist comments and romantic overtures.

The negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation arrived this morning in Ukraine “on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,” Army Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, at the direction of the president, was part of the White House effort to resuscitate peace talks, according to a separate source who is a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll was expected to discuss battlefield conditions and weapons needs with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials, as well as the nascent peace efforts, the official said.\n \n\n   \n   The Wall Street Journal  first reported on the US delegation traveling to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Telegram, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote that he had the honor of meeting with Driscoll, posting a photo of the two men shaking hands.\n \n\n   \n  Shmyhal expressed “gratitude” to the US for its “important support that saves the lives of Ukrainians every day.” He added that he “presented to partners our developments in the field of defense innovations” and “focused on the next steps to implement the historic defense agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll has not been publicly involved in the last rounds of peace talks, but he is a close ally of Vice President JD Vance, with whom he attended Yale Law School. He has focused on military acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  Other officials traveling with Driscoll to Kyiv were Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George; Gen. Chris Donahue, the top US Army commander in Europe; and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.\n \n\n   \n  Russian sources also confirmed to CNN that there are ongoing high-level contacts between US and Russian officials, including Witkoff.\n \n\n   \n  Russian Special Envoy  Kirill Dmitriev went to the US in October  to meet Witkoff and others and had what a Russian source told CNN were “very productive discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  According to an  Axios report , the current draft being hashed out between Washington and Moscow is focused on 28 points, including security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe, as well as future US relations with Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin on Wednesday downplayed the Axios report. When asked about it, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there are “no new developments to report so far” regarding an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  “There were discussions in Anchorage. Beyond what was discussed in Anchorage, there have been no updates yet,” he said, referencing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Europe and Ukraine’s involvement in the talks so far remains unclear, the source familiar said, as well as whether they would support such a plan.\n \n\n   \n  In her first public remarks since reports of the new deal, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Thursday told reporters that “for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.”\n \n\n   \n  Attending the same meeting in Brussels, Poland’s foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said “we command peace efforts, but… it’s, of course, Europe’s security that’s at stake. So we expect to be consulted,” Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a social media post Wednesday evening indicated that the Trump administration is in communication with both Kyiv and Moscow to come up with ideas for possible peace plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he said on X, noting that a lasting peace would also require difficult concessions from both sides. “That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions come as the Trump administration has tried repeatedly to find an end to the war, only for talks to fall apart after Putin refused to make substantial commitments to the effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin, but I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now,” Trump said during remarks at a US-Saudi investment conference Wednesday. “He knows that.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump  spoke with Putin by phone last month , he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced would soon be traveling to Budapest for an in-person summit with the Russian leader.\n \n\n   \n  But just five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  — the first of Trump’s second administration — were on.\n \n\n   \n  US officials told CNN that in the time between, the president and his administration came to the conclusion that Putin’s stance on ending the war had not significantly shifted from the last time he  met Trump on a US air base in Alaska .\n \n\n   \n  Previous US peace talks had focused on freezing Russian and Ukrainian troops along current battle lines. Europe and Ukraine backed the plan as a jumping off point for fresh negotiations, while the Kremlin rejected the proposal, arguing they were not interested in a ceasefire but a longer-term peace deal.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/harvard-launch-investigation-summers-epstein-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"Former Harvard President Larry Summers Steps Aside from Teaching as University Probes Jeffrey Epstein Documents","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Harvard president Larry Summers has stepped away from his teaching role at Harvard as the university investigates personal emails between him and Jeffrey Epstein, which date from 2013 to 2019 and include sexist comments and romantic advice-seeking.

instructor role, a Harvard spokesperson confirmed, as the university investigates emails from Jeffrey Epstein released last week.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Summers has decided it’s in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review,” Summers spokesperson Steven Goldberg told the Associated Press. “His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.” CNN has reached out to Summers for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Summers has served as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School since 2011.\n \n\n   \n  Summers had announced earlier Wednesday he  resigned from the OpenAI board  as he steps away from his public commitments following the release of the Epstein emails.\n \n\n   \n  The Harvard investigation and Summers’ departure from the university and the OpenAI board come after a trove of emails was  released last week  that included years of personal correspondence between the two men.\n \n\n   \n  “The University is conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted,” a Harvard spokesperson told CNN, and said Summers had communicated his decision to the university.\n \n\n   \n  The Harvard Crimson  first reported the story  of Summers’ early departure and the  university’s investigation .\n \n\n   \n  The Crimson reported the investigation will also examine the roles of other people associated with the university who are implicated in the tens of thousands of pages released by the House Oversight Committee — including Summers’ wife, a  professor emerita  of American literature at Harvard, and nearly a dozen current and former Harvard affiliates.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Summers served as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama’s director of the National Economic Council and was  president  of Harvard from 2001 to 2006.\n \n\n   \n  He resigned as the school’s president amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He  currently serves  as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard.\n \n\n   \n  A previous investigation conducted by Harvard into its ties to Epstein revealed the multimillionaire, who  died by suicide  in jail while awaiting trial on charges accusing him of sexually abusing underage girls and running a sex trafficking ring, donated $9.1 million to the university between 1998 and 2008.\n \n\n   \n  No donations were received after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida of one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, according to a 2020  statement  from then-Harvard President Larry Bacow.\n \n\n   \n  The emails released last week  include  numerous exchanges between Summers and Epstein dating from at least 2013 to 2019, which include Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein’s romantic advice.\n \n\n   \n  Congress   on Tuesday  approved  a measure requiring the Justice Department to release all of its investigative files on Epstein within 30 days. The Senate unanimously agreed to pass the House-backed bill, meaning the measure will be sent to President Donald Trump, who has said he’d sign the legislation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/09/09/style/hong-kong-bamboo-scaffolding-hnk-intl-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-05:00","title":"Building a modern metropolis using a centuries-old technique","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Hong Kong, construction workers continue to honor the legendary carpenter Lo Pan through annual rituals at the Ching Lin Terrace temple, reflecting deep-rooted cultural traditions.

    \n  By Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Every year, in the middle of summer, hundreds of Hong Kong construction workers and engineers walk up some 200 steps to Ching Lin Terrace in the seaside neighborhood of Kennedy Town.\n \n\n   \n  There, in one of the city’s temples ,  they gather and pay their respects to Lo Pan, a legendary Chinese carpenter from the Zhou dynasty and patron saint of builders and contractors.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the sweltering heat, workers cram into the tiny temple’s smoke-filled foyer with incense and candlesticks in hand. Bowing several times, they chant slogans in honor of the construction deity’s birthday and pray for a stable year of work.\n \n\n   \n  “I always tell people that Lo Pan is like our Michelangelo. He is a designer, an architect and an engineer,” said Lawrence Ng, president of the Hong Kong Construction Sub-Contractors Association, which represents the city’s waterproofing, metalwork and scaffolding professionals, among others.\n \n\n   \n  “We must pay respects to the workers who came before us, and Lo Pan is our ‘sifu’ (master).”\n \n\n   \n  Worshipping Lo Pan has taken on a particular significance in today’s precarious economy, Ng said.\n \n\n   \n  Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the city has seen  a decline  in large scale construction projects, leaving many laborers  without steady, long-term  employment. Among them are the city’s  “spidermen”  — thousands of construction workers trained in the ancient technique of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n    Part of the city’s visual language\n \n\n   \n  On a slope behind Lo Pan temple is a towering residential building covered in a familiar sight to those who’ve walked Hong Kong’s streets: bamboo poles arranged in a distinct grid-like formation.\n \n\n   \n  The crisscrossed structures, in which each pole is fastened with nylon ties, are ubiquitous across the city’s dense, vertical urban landscape. These scaffolds are erected on skyscrapers, hundreds of feet high, and encased in fabric safety nets forming colorful cocoons of green, blue and purple.\n \n\n   \n  Smaller bamboo contraptions often poke out of windows, or cover air conditioning units and balconies.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo scaffolding is not only used in the construction of new buildings, but the renovation of thousands of high-rises and historic tenements (“tong lau”) every year.\n \n\n   \n  Popular in Hong Kong for over a century, the technique’s origins in Chinese construction date back to at least the Han dynasty, around 2,000 years ago. The method was also widely used in mainland China until government regulations started calling for steel and aluminum scaffolds, in keeping with international norms, in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Bamboo, however, remained the go-to material in Hong Kong, and has been used to build some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers, like Norman Foster’s HSBC headquarters and parts of the 88-floor International Finance Centre.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from helping develop Hong Kong’s modern structures, bamboo has also played an integral role in building temporary Cantonese opera  theaters .\n \n\n   \n  These traditional theaters, made entirely out of the plant, are built on special occasions like the birthdays of local deities or the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n \n\n   \n  Scaffolding has, in turn, become part of the city’s visual language. Being lightweight, customizable and relatively affordable, bamboo stands in stark contrast to its mainstream counterpart, metal.\n \n\n   \n  “Steel is relatively stiff and strong, but it’s less flexible than bamboo,” said Goman Ho, a structural engineer at British engineering firm Arup, who has more than three decades of experience overseeing the development of tall buildings in the city, including the 283-meter (928-foot) tall Cheung Kong Center.\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo on the other hand, has its own craftsmanship,” he added. “You can build a lot of beautiful scaffolding in ways you’d never think of.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s culture we need to maintain’\n \n\n   \n  Whether in traditional or modern construction, handling the long poles requires specific skills and intuition, which can take months or years to achieve.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes people spend one, two, three or even four years learning bamboo scaffolding and may not become masters,” said Ho Ping-Tak (no relation), Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union.\n \n\n   \n  “But with metal, the technical requirements are lower. If you have the strength, you can generally meet the requirements in a much shorter time.”\n \n\n   \n  The largest member of the grass family, bamboo is combustible, susceptible to deterioration and weaker in rain, raising legitimate questions about its durability, Arup’s Ho said.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to find ways to overcome it,” he said of these challenges, suggesting that poles could be coated with epoxy or plastic solution to prevent erosion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s culture we need to maintain,” Ho added.\n \n\n   \n  But keeping the tradition alive is challenging. The industry comprises an aging workforce –– many, like 78-year-old Leung Siu Wai, among the dozens of senior bamboo scaffold workers paying respects to Lo Pan, are close to retirement. New talent is also lacking, said Ng.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to get young people to enter,” he added. “Young people in Hong Kong don’t want to do physically demanding work, or work that gives them an identity they feel uncomfortable with.”\n \n\n   \n  Discussions on safeguarding the practice resurfaced earlier this year when the Hong Kong government’s Development Bureau  announced  that 50% of new public building projects erected from March onwards would need to use metal scaffolding to “better protect workers” and align with modern construction standards in “advanced cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The notice sparked concern among some Hong Kong residents, even though the policy will only impact “one or two new building projects” this year, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The bureau later confirmed to CNN that only one public project would be affected in 2025. Nonetheless, some residents have taken to social media to lament what they believed to be the beginning of the end of bamboo scaffolding.\n \n\n   \n  “This is your sign to film bamboo scaffolding while you still can,” wrote a Hong Kong videographer in an Instagram  post  that garnered over 20,000 likes. “Truly one of Hong Kong’s quiet wonders. And soon, it’ll just be part of the past.”\n \n\n   \n  The storied building technique has also been celebrated on the global stage, presented as part of the Hong Kong pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale –– the world’s largest architecture exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  In May, a sprawling bamboo scaffold was built in the courtyard of Venice’s Campo della Tana, as part of a showcase exploring the diverse and often juxtaposing aspects of public space in Hong Kong, with a focus on threatened heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Its curators said their proposal for the pavilion was finalized in January, two months before the government announced its move to adopt more metal scaffolding in construction.\n \n\n   \n  “We were a bit shocked, to say the least, because we had planned for this without knowing (the government’s announcement) was coming,” said Ying Zhou, an architect and one of the curators.\n \n\n   \n  “So immediately, we were like, ‘Oh what does our thing now say?’ It takes on a whole different kind of importance, especially when we bring it to a place like Venice.”\n \n\n   \n  Eleven bamboo “sifus,” or masters, traveled to Venice to build the structure. Watching them in action, Zhou’s Italian counterparts were, she said, impressed with the way the material was assembled so quickly and precisely –– without much calculation.\n \n\n   \n  “These pre-modern technologies are never recognized in a standardized world, because you have steel, you have concrete, you have numbers that are calculable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “And here we have something that even the Italians are like, ‘Oh, we need your structural engineer to certify (it).’”\n \n\n   \n    Safety concerns\n \n\n   \n  Thirty-six-year-old Over Chan, a bamboo scaffold worker who builds structures for external repair work, claims that recent industry-wide discussions about fatal accidents on construction sites have prompted more government intervention. (There were  24 deaths related to bamboo scaffolding  from January 2018 to August 2025, according to Hong Kong’s Labour Department).\n \n\n   \n  “When I was starting out as a worker, we didn’t even have to wear shirts, but now, we’re required to wear our uniform, have good manners, and so on –– this ultimately allows us to rise above the competition.”\n \n\n   \n  “Bamboo is not unsafe,” Ho, the chairman of the workers’ union, said, emphasizing the importance of workers fastening themselves to the wooden structures.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fine to use metal scaffolding –– we’re not saying that metal scaffolding is a competing technique, but if (the government) makes an announcement without much explanation…it gives the public the wrong impression that bamboo is unsafe, which has huge implications.”\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s Development Bureau told CNN that adopting metal scaffolding in construction is just one of many ways to improve site safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Provided relevant legislative requirements on bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds are fulfilled, both types of scaffolds are safe,” the bureau said in an email, adding that the government has “no intention to phase out the adoption of bamboo scaffolds.”\n \n\n   \n  Many large-scale construction projects in Hong Kong already incorporate a hybrid of bamboo and steel scaffolding, the union leader Ho said, with metal bars fixed to the ground supporting wooden structures higher up.\n \n\n   \n  He estimates that, currently, 80% of scaffolds are created using bamboo, while 20% use metal or a hybrid of materials.\n \n\n   \n  Chan, who remains eager and optimistic about the trade, said he has started taking courses on metal scaffolding to stand out in the workforce, despite his belief that bamboo isn’t going anywhere.\n \n\n   \n  “Over the past few years, there’s been this feeling in Hong Kong about needing to preserve what’s left of the city’s identity,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/trump-epstein-bill-larry-summers-congress-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000Z","title":"Washington on tenterhooks for next steps in Epstein saga","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of a bipartisan congressional effort to mandate transparency, the U.S. Justice Department is under pressure to release all investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.

Washington on tenterhooks for next steps in Epstein saga \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What now?\n \n\n   \n  The drama, emotion and shock of Congress’s sudden demand for transparency on the  Jeffrey Epstein drama  has ceded to uncertainty and suspicion that President Donald Trump will try to wriggle off the political hook.\n \n\n   \n  The  victims of Epstein , an accused sex trafficker, have tragically seen justice postponed before. They’d been quick to warn after an unprecedented Republican revolt against Trump on Tuesday that it was just one more step in their long quest for vindication. Their wisdom was obvious once the euphoria of their triumph began to clear.\n \n\n   \n  Washington waited all day Wednesday to find out that  Trump had signed   the bill  passed with a 427-1 majority in the House and waved through on unanimous consent by the Senate, which had no desire to be drawn into the president’s self-inflicted political crisis. The measure requires the Justice Department to release  all investigative files , documents and other materials about Epstein, with some exceptions,  within 30 days  of it becoming law. It’s hardly surprising that Trump didn’t rush to sign it, since, despite his late embrace of the legislation, it repudiated his weekslong bid to keep the evidence secret.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was in a box. Any presidential veto was likely to be overturned, judging by the congressional majorities for the bill. But now his Justice Department — in theory at least — is bound to implement it. Any foot-dragging or obstruction would certainly worsen already disastrous public disapproval of his handling of the issue and would only fuel the question that got him into his current mess: What is he trying to hide?\n \n\n   \n    The political battle to come\n \n\n   \n  Epstein survivors and Trump critics are turning to the next stage of the political battle over the documents, but there is almost no clarity over if and when evidence will come out — and how much.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers who endorsed the bill seemed unclear what would happen if Trump just ignored it. And Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi put on a flustered public performance that fostered little confidence that she would obey Congress or that the administration has a coherent political plan.\n \n\n   \n  There were also new indications of the depth of the bipartisan morass over Epstein and the likelihood that the release of Justice Department files could cause deep embarrassment for many prominent business and political leaders, entertainment stars and even royalty who associated with him.\n \n\n   \n  Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and top White House official in Democratic administrations  resigned from the board of OpenAI  after the release of emails revealed his friendly correspondence with Epstein. Summers also will not finish out the semester in his instructor role at Harvard University, a school spokesperson  confirmed Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  And  Stacey Plaskett , a Democrat who represents the US Virgin Islands in Congress as a non-voting delegate, struggled for a convincing explanation of why she texted with Epstein during a congressional hearing in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  No one can say where this extraordinary scandal with far-reaching consequences will go next. But one thing is clear — it is deeply damaging Trump, both in wider public opinion and because of a never-before-seen split that it has opened in the MAGA movement.\n \n\n   \n  A newly released Marquette University poll — conducted November 5-12, before many of the saga’s latest developments — found that 74% of adults disapproved of Trump’s handling of the Epstein affair. And only 43% of Republicans approved. Marquette’s question asking Americans to choose their top issue didn’t include Epstein on the list. But it found that Americans cared deeply about the economy and the cost of living, on which they gave Trump overwhelmingly negative report cards.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ is yet to show its cards\n \n\n   \n  Such is the reputation of Trump’s Department of Justice — a fully coopted branch of his political machine — that few observers in Washington expect Bondi to follow the letter of the law just established by Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that his party would be ready to hold Trump to account. This shows that Democrats believe that Trump’s exposure to the Epstein drama will outweigh any embarrassment that disclosures could bring to other prominent Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “There must be no funny business from Donald Trump,” Schumer said. “This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people, even if he doesn’t want to.”\n \n\n   \n  Schumer referred to the possibility that the DOJ could seek an end run around the bill. It could potentially cite investigations into prominent Democrats and Epstein that Trump ordered last week to argue against the release of evidence. Another possibility is that evidence could be released but redacted in such a way as to make it almost meaningless on the premise that officials were protecting victims, witnesses or people who committed no criminal wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Some Democrats fear the DOJ will scrub any references to the president himself in the files. There has been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to Epstein. But emails released by Congress showed  multiple mentions of him  by Epstein and his jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN’s John Berman on Wednesday that he had “no trust, no confidence whatsoever … that this Justice Department will be evenhanded or fair in the disclosure of these files.” He added, “It will be on us in Congress, and hopefully a bipartisan effort, to scrutinize and oversee this process.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican rebellion against Trump on the Epstein files — an issue that obsesses parts of the Republican base — is one thing. But it’s unclear whether GOP lawmakers would risk the kind of vigorous oversight to which they’ve never subjected Trump to force his compliance with their law. Pressure from Epstein victims could be important in this regard.\n \n\n   \n  Several senators expressed hopes Wednesday that the administration would show good faith. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he’d “be really surprised” if the DOJ refused to release all the required information “given the huge bipartisan” support for the measure. Missouri’s other senator, Eric Schmitt, said that “all the credible information that can be released should be released.” And Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN’s Manu Raju he hoped Trump wouldn’t “defy the act of Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Justice Department, Bondi was asked why she had agreed to Trump’s  demand to investigate Democrats over Epstein  — which critics say was an archly political move — after arguing earlier this year that the evidence suggested no new probes were necessary.\n \n\n   \n  “Information. Information. There’s information that, new information, additional information,” Bondi said, while offering no clarity on the situation. And she repeatedly told reporters, “We will follow the law, we will continue to follow the law, while protecting victims and also providing maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  This only underscored the great unknowns about what will happen next. Given the extraordinary movement in the saga so far, it seems impossible to believe that the files won’t come out, somehow, eventually. If the administration stalls or obstructs, it’s possible DOJ whistleblowers will emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers keen to get to Trump’s right on the issue ahead of midterm elections might discover a political motive to join colleagues like  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  in pushing for transparency. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has warned he’d be ready to read aspects of the evidence surrounding Epstein into the record of the House. And a delay could help Democrats weaponize the issue ahead of midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The survivors will be waiting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping that they’re going to do the right thing and release everything,” Sharlene Rochard, a victim of Epstein’s abuse, told CNN’s Audie Cornish. “We just want proof that this happened to us. … And we want to help other girls (so) that — that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00Z","title":"Trump Signs Bill to Release Epstein Case Files; Public Access to Records Sparks Political and Legal Scrutiny","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has signed a bill directing the Department of Justice to release all records from the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:05 AM EST, Thu November 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said on social media Wednesday he has  signed the bill  that directs the Justice Department to publicly release all records amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Others   came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February, the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Two financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase — where Epstein held bank accounts — also reached settlements with survivors and others.\n \n\n   \n  Records from a lawsuit brought by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned Little Saint James, against JPMorgan Chase revealed details about Epstein’s  financial transactions  with Wall Street titans and his practice of withdrawing large amounts of cash. JPMorgan filed numerous suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department flagging those transactions.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell,   Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  In November, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The recent release   was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.

of potentially deadly botulism in babies who drank ByHeart infant formula continue to grow, state officials say they are still finding the  recalled product  on some store shelves.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile the company reported late Wednesday that laboratory tests confirmed that some samples of formula were contaminated with the type of bacteria that has sickened more than 30 babies in the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Tests by an independent food safety laboratory found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1, the company said on its website. ByHeart officials said they notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the findings but did not specify how many samples were tested or how many were positive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” ByHeart said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings.\n \n\n   \n  The lab results come as investigators in at least three states found ByHeart formula still for sale even after the New York-based company recalled all products nationwide, officials told The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 babies in 15 states who drank ByHeart formula have been hospitalized and treated for infantile botulism since August,  federal health officials said Wednesday.  They range in age from about 2 weeks to about 6 months, with the most recent case reported on Nov. 13.\n \n\n   \n  No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  In Oregon, nine of more than 150 stores checked still had the formula on shelves this week, a state agriculture official said. In Minnesota, investigators conducted 119 checks between Nov. 13 and Nov. 17 and removed recalled products from sale at four sites, an agriculture department official said. An Arizona health official also said they found the product available.\n \n\n   \n  Businesses and consumers should remain alert, Minnesota officials said in a statement. “No affected product should be sold or consumed,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted inspections at ByHeart manufacturing plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon. No results from the inspections have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  California officials previously confirmed the germ that can lead to illness in an open can of ByHeart formula fed to a baby who fell ill.\n \n\n   \n   Infant botulism,  which can cause paralysis and death, is caused by a type of bacteria that forms spores that germinate in a baby’s gut and produce a toxin.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and include constipation, poor feeding, a weak cry, drooping eyelids or a flat facial expression. Babies can develop weakness in their limbs and head and may feel “floppy.” They can have trouble swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart had been manufacturing about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It was sold online or at retail stores such as Target and Walmart. A Walmart spokesperson said the company swiftly issued a restriction that prevented sale of the formula, removed the product from stores and notified consumers who had bought it. Customers can visit any store for a refund of the formula, which sold for about $42 per can.\n \n\n   \n  Federal and state health officials are concerned that some parents and caregivers may still have ByHeart products in their homes. They are advising consumers to stop using the product — including formula in cans and any singe-serve sticks. They also suggest marking it “DO NOT USE” and keeping it for at least a month in case a baby develops symptoms. In that case, the formula would need to be tested.\n \n\n   \n  The California health department operates the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which tracks cases and distributes treatment for the disease. Officials there have launched a public hotline at 833-398-2022, which is staffed with health officials from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.\n \n\n   \n  The new hotline was created after calls from hundreds of parents and caregivers flooded a different, longstanding hotline for doctors to discuss suspected infant botulism cases, officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/jonathan-joss-murder-texas-man-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"Texas man indicted on murder charge in shooting of 'King of the Hill' voice actor Jonathan Joss","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grand jury in Bexar County, Texas, has indicted Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57, on murder charges for the shooting of Jonathan Joss, a well-known voice actor who provided the voice of John Redcorn on 'King of the Hill' and a recurring role on 'Parks and Recreation'.

\nUpdated: \n        9:29 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A grand jury in Texas has indicted the man accused of killing “King of the Hill” voice actor  Jonathan Joss  on a murder charge.\n \n\n   \n  But it is unclear whether Joss’ killing will be considered a hate crime. Police in San Antonio did not immediately return an email seeking comment Wednesday on whether its investigation had determined that Joss’  sexual orientation  played a role in his shooting, and the Bexar County District Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Police allege Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57,  confronted Joss  and his husband on June 1 as they were checking their mail at their San Antonio home, which had been burned down in January.\n \n\n   \n  Joss’ husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled “violent homophobic slurs” before opening fire.\n \n\n   \n  Ceja Alvarez’s attorneys did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In June, Alfonso Otero, one of Ceja Alvarez’s attorneys, said his client was innocent and denied making any homophobic statements.\n \n\n   \n  The grand jury returned the indictment Monday, and Ceja Alvarez remains free on a $200,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n  A friend of the 59-year-old Joss has said that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, San Antonio police had said there was no evidence indicating the shooting was related to Joss’ sexual orientation. But San Antonio Police Chief William McManus later walked back that statement, saying it had been “premature” and that whether Joss’ sexual orientation played a role in the shooting was “part of the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  The district attorney’s office said in a statement Wednesday that Ceja Alvarez “is charged with murder, which is the most serious charge applicable to this crime under Texas law. As the case is still pending, no additional details or information can be released at this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Under Texas law, a hate crime — if there’s a conviction — would be handled as an enhancement during sentencing and not as a separate charge.\n \n\n   \n  Joss was the voice of John Redcorn, a Native American character on the popular “King of the Hill” animated series, which ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show, which Joss had already worked on, premiered in August.\n \n\n   \n  Joss also had a recurring role on the television show “Parks and Recreation,” playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series “Tulsa King” in 2022.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/ryan-wedding-justice-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-05:00","title":"Federal officials unveil more charges against the former Olympic snowboarder accused of running international drug ring","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal officials have unveiled expanded charges against Ryan James Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder from Canada, accusing him of running an international drug trafficking ring that transported cocaine from Colombia through Mexico into the U.S. and Canada.

City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting,” Trump wrote  on his Truth Social platform . “We have agreed that this meeting will take place at the Oval Office on Friday, November 21st. Further details to follow!”\n \n\n   \n  Dora Pekec, a spokesperson for the mayor-elect, confirmed the meeting in a statement, saying, “As is customary for an incoming mayoral administration, the Mayor-elect plans to meet with the President in Washington to discuss public safety, economic security and the affordability agenda that over one million New Yorkers voted for just two weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before Trump announced the meeting, Mamdani confirmed his camp had reached out to arrange a meeting with the president in an interview with MS NOW.\n \n\n   \n  “We did reach out to the White House – and my team reached out because of a commitment that I made to New Yorkers, that I would be willing to meet with anyone and everyone, so long as it was to the benefit of 8.5 million people who call the city home and their struggle to afford the most expensive city United States of America,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Mamdani would cap off months of acrimony between the two New Yorkers, who have traded barbs on the stump and in the press since Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary in June.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has used the Democratic Socialist Mamdani as a foil, seeking to link his politics to Democrats across the country and deriding him as “my little communist” in remarks from the Oval Office. He also threatened ahead of the election to take federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Mamdani directly addressed the president in his victory speech  moments after clinching the mayor’s race this month , joking, “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n \n\n   \n  Returning to the White House from his West Palm Beach home Sunday, Trump teased a meeting with Mamdani, telling reporters at Joint Base Andrews, “The mayor of New York, I will say, would like to meet with us, and we’ll work something out. But he, he would like to come to Washington and meet. And we’ll work something out. We want to see everything work out well for New York.”\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretches of the mayoral race, Trump had struck a far more antagonistic tone,  throwing his weight behind former Democratic governor and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  in the hopes of stalling Mamdani’s momentum.\n \n\n   \n  “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Trump wrote just two days before Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Previewing a potential meeting with Trump Wednesday, Mamdani told MS Now, “I want to just speak plainly to the president about what it means to actually stand up for New Yorkers and the way in which New Yorkers are struggling to afford this city, and frankly, cost of living is something that I heard time and time again from New Yorkers about why they voted for Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/release-epstein-files-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:56:00-05:00","title":"Trump Signed the Epstein Files Bill.

Epstein files bill. Will he actually release them all? \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:56 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Both chambers of Congress passed legislation this week  forcing the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files , after President Donald Trump  capitulated  and blessed the bill. Trump said Wednesday night he had signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Now the question has quickly become: Will the Trump administration  actually release everything  the Justice Department has? Plenty of supporters of the legislation, including Republicans, have been quick to caution that this isn’t the end of the matter — that the White House might still have ways to get around that.\n \n\n   \n  “The real test will be: Will the Department of Justice release the files?” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said Tuesday. “Or will it all remain tied up in investigations?”\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — the co-sponsor of the effort in the House to force a vote on the issue — has warned of a “last-ditch effort” by the administration to block the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  These lawmakers have good reason to worry, based on the administration’s actions and comments. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday declined to provide assurances beyond saying the administration would “follow the law.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also difficult to see how the administration could not follow through with releasing the files — at least without risking yet another major political fiasco.\n \n\n   \n    The administration’s suspicious moves\n \n\n   \n  First, some background. There is a clear path for the administration to try and hold some documents back.\n \n\n   \n  It goes like this:\n \n\n   \n  That’s a very convenient progression of events if your goal is to try and withhold documents.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly an investigation that was completely exhausted and needed to be closed has some supposedly juicy new leads that are worth pursuing. And this happens right at the time when Trump needs just such a pretext to keep avoiding full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  There are certainly other reasons for Trump to want those investigations – including making it look like it’s  other  people (ones often associated with Democrats) who have Epstein problems, and not him. (Neither Trump nor the people he asked to be investigated have been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n    The administration has played games on this before\n \n\n   \n  There are other reasons to be suspicious about how the administration might handle this.\n \n\n   \n  For one, it’s  already been  shown to be playing games  on Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  When the situation first blew up in its face in July, the administration’s first big effort to quell the backlash was to push for judges to release grand jury materials. But as plenty of experts quickly noted, that was unlikely to actually shed much light for a host of reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, it did not shed much light. But not only that; two judges suggested the administration was proactively creating a “diversion.” One said the move appeared “ aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such .”\n \n\n   \n  Both noted the government had much more extensive information at its fingertips that it could release whenever it wanted to.\n \n\n   \n  Given this, it wouldn’t seem ridiculous to ask whether the administration might play games with whatever discretion it has — say, by releasing information that’s politically advantageous but withholding other information using the available justifications.\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump and Co. have said they didn’t want full disclosure\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the many things Trump and top officials have said warning about the dangers of full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly cited the need to protect “innocent” people – not just victims, but also people whose names turn up in the documents who did nothing wrong. Just corresponding with Epstein, for example, would not be a crime.\n \n\n   \n  “You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said in August, “because (Epstein) knew everybody in Palm Beach.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s July memo that announced it wouldn’t be releasing any new documents cited a desire “to protect victims” and “not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel in September testimony to Congress and elsewhere has suggested that part of the reason the administration has resisted full disclosure was to guard against releasing pornography. He also suggested that releasing more information could violate court orders.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,” Patel told a House Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  And House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday argued that the Epstein bill could hurt people whose “names may be in these files, and they had nothing to do with this.” The Louisiana Republican also made an impassioned case that the bill did not adequately prevent the release of child sexual abuse material, despite a clause intended to do that.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson ultimately voted for the bill, saying he hoped the Senate would amend it. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune apparently didn’t share his concerns, allowing the bill to pass by unanimous consent without amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of this — and given Trump’s clear reluctance for months to grant such disclosure, right  up until the moment the battle appeared lost  — you could see how the administration might want to at least preserve its options.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that Congress “can have whatever they are legally entitled to,” but the phrase “legally entitled to” certainly looms large, for the reasons mentioned above.\n \n\n   \n    But not releasing would be a huge risk\n \n\n   \n  Even if the administration is reserving its options or intends to withhold significant documents, it’s hard to see how doing that could pass muster politically.\n \n\n   \n  For one, the legislation requires the withholding of documents related to active investigations to be “narrowly tailored and temporary.” Trump has more than three years remaining in his presidency; it’s difficult to see the administration withholding significant information for that long citing active investigations.\n \n\n   \n  For another, anything that’s redacted or withheld must include a written justification, and the administration must notify Congress about these categories of documents within 15 days. The legislation also requires the administration to give Congress an unredacted “list of all government officials and politically exposed persons” included in the materials.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it could be pretty easy to piece together if the administration is hiding extensive amounts of information. What’s more, attempting to do that could risk an even bigger backlash than the administration has already seen, from even its own base.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the administration wouldn’t  attempt  to withhold documents. Its handling of this matter  has been baffling  throughout.\n \n\n   \n  But if it did, that would be among the most desperate and politically risky things the administration has done — and at a time when it can’t really keep taking such hits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615169","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"After calling him a 'communist,' Trump will meet Mamdani in the Oval Office Friday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump will meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office on Friday, November 21, 2025, marking the first face-to-face encounter between the two.

Trump has repeatedly sought to paint Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, as too radical and extreme for the city that the president long called home. In the president's announcement of the meeting on Truth Social, Trump called Mamdani a \"communist.\" It's a narrative that Mamdani has firmly pushed back on, vowing to carry out his agenda focused on lowering the cost of living. \"My team reached out to the White House to set up this meeting because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than eight and a half million people who call this city home,\" Mamdani told reporters on Thursday. \"I have many disagreements with the president, and I believe that we should be relentless and pursue all avenues and all meetings that could make our city affordable for every single New Yorker.\" Trump has been a vocal opponent of Mamdani since his  upset win  in June's Democratic primary, saying he would arrest Mamdani if he disrupted ICE operations in the city and threatening to pull the city's federal funding should he win in November. \"Look, we don't need a communist in this country, but if we have one, I'm going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation,\" Trump told reporters over the summer, shortly after Mamdani's primary win. Mamdani responded directly to Trump in his victory speech on election night. \"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,\" he said, adding, \"to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.\" Over the course of just months, Mamdani's candidacy for mayor turned from a long-shot bid to a national movement, sparking interest  far beyond New York  in his progressive ideas, including freezing rent in rent-stabilized units, making city buses free and opening city-run grocery stores; and skepticism about how the new mayor will find the money to pay for it all. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/arctic-frost-provision-senators-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"House Moves to Repeal Controversial 'Arctic Frost' Provision That Allows GOP Senators to Seek $500,000 Payouts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously voted to repeal a controversial provision in a government funding bill that allowed senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 when their phone records were seized without notice, stemming from the 'Arctic Frost' investigation into the 2020 fake elector scheme.

Alison Main, Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer, Ted  Barrett, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:02 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House on Wednesday unanimously moved to repeal a controversial provision in the government funding law that allows senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 when their phone records are seized without their knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  The provision, included in the legislation that ended the historic shutdown, requires senators be notified when federal investigators access their phone records, with some exceptions. If they’re not notified, the lawmakers can sue the federal government for up to $500,000 in damages for each violation.\n \n\n   \n  House members publicly wary of the measure voted 426-0 to nullify the provision. But its future remains in doubt in the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune had added it to the bill at the request of several members of his conference.\n \n\n   \n   Tucked into one of the appropriations bills , the language comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called “Arctic Frost,” which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Donald Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register Electoral College votes for Trump from states that former President Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  It’s caused bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill and spotlighted a rare divide between the top Republican leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was blindsided by the measure, while Thune has resolutely stood behind it.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re striking the provision as fast as we can, and we expect the Senate to move it,” Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN Tuesday. “We believe there’s a fairly sizable growing majority over there that believes that they should strike it.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senators whose phone records were seized as part of Arctic Frost have tried to distance themselves from the legislation and  say they won’t seek  monetary damages.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley called it a “bad idea.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m all for accountability. I mean, I had my phone tapped, so I’m all for accountability, don’t get me wrong, but I just, I think taking taxpayer money is not the way to do it. The way to do it is tough oversight,” he told reporters earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for another member, Sen. Dan Sullivan, told CNN last week he does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House effort to repeal the provision.\n \n\n   \n  But at least one targeted senator is looking to reap gains.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday said he plans on suing DOJ in his case for “far more” than $500,000, and advocated for expanding the measure to include private citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “You want to make sure that people who are going to issue subpoenas in the future against private citizens to get their phone records without a court order, I mean, without a warrant, have to think twice, and if the government doesn’t pay, you’re going to get more of this,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds, who was not one of the senators swept in Arctic Frost, explained that the measure was meant to “send a message to the administration that this can’t happen” in the wake of the news of then-special counsel Jack Smith’s subpoenas, though he predicted that many GOP senators would be “open for a reconsideration” depending on how the House approaches the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Steve Daines, a Thune ally, said he doesn’t think House’s measure could pass the Senate, arguing that Smith’s move to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers with grand jury subpoenas in his January 6 investigation was a “massive overreach.”\n \n\n   \n  “My name is not on the list, so I don’t benefit from this. This seems to be a strong pushback. I think the provision that Leader Thune put in there was appropriate, and I stand by his leadership,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/cherfilus-mccormick-indicted-fema-funds-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"Rep.

Here's what voting officials are watching \n         By Miles Parks \n        \n           Friday, November 21, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Less than a year from the midterm elections, state and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of interference by a federal government helmed by President Trump. The problem is, no one knows what might be coming. Steve Simon, the Democratic secretary of state of Minnesota, likened it to planning for natural disasters. \"You have to use your imagination to consider and plan for the most extreme scenario,\" Simon said. Carly Koppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County in Colorado, said officials in her state are shoring up their relationships with local law enforcement and county and state attorney's offices, to make sure any effort to interfere with voting is \"met with a pretty good force of resistance.\" \"We have to plan for the worst and hope we get the best,\" Koppes said. \"I think we're all kind of conditioned at this point to expect anything and everything, and our bingo cards keep getting bigger and bigger with things that we would have never have had on them.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump, who continues to spread false claims about voting in America, issued an executive order in the spring that sought to mandate  major changes  to the elections system. That order has so far  mostly been blocked  by the courts, but he's teased other executive action as well. And his administration is still  investigating  his loss five years ago, while  pardoning  people associated with his efforts to try to overturn that defeat. All of that has made it clear to those in the elections community that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a few things voting officials are watching for. More executive action to take control of voting The Constitution is  clear : States control their own election processes, with Congress able to set guidelines for federal races. The president has virtually no authority when it comes to voting. But Trump is testing that, and those in his circle have pushed fringe theories for how he can change how ballots are cast and counted. Earlier this month , press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House is working on a new executive order that will seemingly target mail voting. Trump also said earlier this year that he wanted to  ban some voting machines , though it's unclear exactly what he was referring to. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Election officials agree he does not have the legal authority to do either of those things. But recently, Trump ally and attorney Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump in 2020, broached a bolder strategy to enact election changes: declaring a national emergency. \"The president's authority is limited in his role with regard to elections except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States — as I think that we can establish with the porous system that we have,\" Mitchell said on a  podcast appearance  in September. It would be keeping with one of Trump's broader policy strategies: This year he's invoked presidential emergency powers  more frequently  than any other modern president. Election  experts  say there's no legal basis for Mitchell's theory, but numerous voting officials told NPR it's something that's come up in conversations about next year. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who previously oversaw voting in California as secretary of state, also brought up the scenario recently on the Senate floor. \"If the Trump White House tried to declare some fake national emergency to create a pretense for federal intervention, I will force a vote here in the Senate to stop it,\" Padilla said. Troops on the ground Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, says six months ago he wouldn't have taken the premise of federal troops at polling places seriously. But seeing how the National Guard was deployed — and justified — this summer changed his thinking. \"You have National Guard deploying to cities to supposedly quell these 'demonstrations' — basically  people in frog suits  and riding their  bikes naked  is the biggest threat,\" Hobbs said. \"And yeah, I start thinking that maybe it could be possible.\" Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump  spoke of  a desire to have federal law enforcement patrol voting locations, and this year, his former adviser Steve Bannon said on his  War Room podcast  that he hopes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are patrolling polling places in the midterms. Legal  experts  say such intervention is clearly illegal, but until the federal government disavows such actions clearly, Simon said voting officials have to game out how to respond. \"One thing that would help is if someone at the federal government would come out and categorically say, 'No, no, no, stop the presses, stop everything. You'll never have to worry about that. That's not something we would ever consider doing,'\" Simon said. \"That would go a long way.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to questions about forces outside polling places, and other scenarios mentioned in this story, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson characterized them as \"baseless conspiracy theories and Democrat talking points\" but did not directly answer whether the White House would commit not to send agents to voting locations. She reiterated that the president is permitted to send federal personnel to localities to help quell violent crime. Who is a trusted source? For the last decade, as voting officials have fought to dam up a tsunami of false information about their work, they've begged people in their communities to go to \"trusted sources\" for election information. In 2026, figuring out who is a trusted source may be more difficult than ever. Along with Trump himself, his administration has elevated to prominent government roles  numerous people  who have a history of spreading false information about elections, and local officials worry their message may be drowned out by those with much bigger megaphones. One of the hires alarming voting officials interviewed by NPR works at the Department of Homeland Security. Heather Honey, who's now deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity, worked alongside Mitchell for the past few years to help  spread election conspiracy theories , including one about votes in Pennsylvania that  Trump mentioned  in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a mob stormed the Capitol. \"I equate this to having a moon landing conspiracy theorist and flat earther being offered a job at NASA,\" Hobbs said. DHS did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Numerous   officials  at the Department of Justice also have a history of election denial. Unprecedented demands The insistence to  relitigate  2020 also has voting officials worried about what sort of actions administration officials plan to take. Already this year, DOJ has made unprecedented requests to investigate  voting machines ,  access  old ballots, and  accumulate  mass amounts of voter data. This summer, a  consultant  in Colorado contacted Koppes and other clerks in that state, in some cases saying he was associated with the White House and asking about accessing their voting machines. The White House denied to  CNN  and  other outlets  authorizing the requests, but separately,  in Missouri , a Department of Justice official reached out to clerks there asking basically the same thing. In each instance, they were told no. \"Since 2020, people in the elections world have become even more knowledgeable of the responsibilities of the different levels of government [when it comes to voting equipment],\" Koppes said. A similar push and pull is playing out with elections data. The Trump administration has quickly built what is essentially a  searchable national citizenship database , and is trying to entice states to run their voting records through it to root out noncitizens on voter rolls. While many Republican election officials have eagerly embraced the system, other GOP officials and their Democratic counterparts have been  hesitant to engage with the tool , as there are questions about how well it works, what happens to the voting data once it's been run through the system and, in many states, whether even using the tool is legal under state law. Still, the administration is intent to investigate voter rolls as it continues to push  false narratives  about widespread noncitizen voting. The DOJ recently  sued  eight states (all states Trump lost in 2020) in an effort to compel them to turn over their rolls. \"It's really not a red state or blue state thing,\" said Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of state of Pennsylvania, in an  interview with PBS News Hour  about the data demands. \"It is a — in my view, a concerning attempt, a concerning effort to consolidate and overreach at the federal level. In the United States of America, it's the states who run elections, not the federal government.\" Vulnerable targets Since Trump took office, the federal government has pulled back on virtually all of its work related to cybersecurity and elections. The Department of Homeland Security  laid off  employees focused on election security, and stopped  funding  a partnership that helped local elections offices share threat information. Wesley Wilcox, a Republican election supervisor in Marion County, Fla., said smaller counties especially will be more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the cuts, and Russia, China or any other U.S. adversary may see an opportunity. \"That's what I would do,\" Wilcox said. \"I mean, if I were on that side of the fence, I'm like, 'OK, they're cutting this stuff out. Let's go get them.' You know, 'cause the defenses are down.\" Secretary Hobbs, of Washington, told NPR that two years ago he was notified by DHS about a hack in one of his counties. The state responded immediately to make sure the breach wouldn't impact the voter registration database. Now, Hobbs said, \"I don't even know if I would have gotten that phone call, to tell you the truth.\" In Arizona, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat,  said  he didn't even contact DHS' cyber agency after an online candidate portal was hacked this summer because he didn't have confidence in the agency's \"capacity to collaborate in good faith or to prioritize national security over political theater.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting musical performances hosted on the Tiny Desk series, which is a segment of NPR's programming that showcases artists performing live in a simple, intimate setting.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Music","Live Performances","Intimate Music Shows"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615190","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00-05:00","title":"White House Condemns Democratic Lawmakers' Video but Backs Off Trump's Posts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House responded to a video by Democratic lawmakers, including Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan, Mark Kelly, and Elissa Slotkin, who urged military and intelligence personnel to refuse illegal orders and protect the Constitution.

members of Congress executed despite his social media post earlier in the day, calling a video by some members \"seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH!\" Trump made a pair of posts on his site, Truth Social, in response to a video posted by Reps. Jason Crow, D-Colo., Chris DeLuzio, D-Pa, Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., where the lawmakers address members of the military and intelligence communities and said, \"You can refuse illegal orders,\" repeating the phrase several times before saying, \"You must refuse illegal orders.\" The lawmakers, all of whom come from military backgrounds, said, \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\"  The video, posted to Facebook , also says \"right now the threats of our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but right here at home.\" Asked during the daily White House briefing if he wanted execute members of Congress, Leavitt said: \"No.\" \"The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command, and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed. It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging,\" Leavitt said. The president also reposted a series of comments from users on Truth Social, including posts that said the Democrats should be hanged, the actions were an insurrection and they should all be indicted because of the video. In the video Democrats didn't call out any specific actions that military or intelligence officials have been told to carry out, but they said that the Trump administration is \"pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\" They added that military and intelligence personnel swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. \"Right now the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but right here at home,\" they said. \"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.\" They ended the video by telling those in the military and intelligence officials, \"Don't give up the ship,\" referring to the famous last words of James Lawrence, a Navy Captain during the war of 1812, to keep fighting and not surrender. Members of the military do swear an oath to the Constitution and are trained that \"following orders\" is not a defense for illegal acts. The lawmakers issued a joint statement to Trump's response, saying in part, \"We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.\" \"Every American must unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity,\" they said. House Democratic leadership — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California — called for Trump to remove the posts and for Republicans to condemn them. \"We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump's disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same,\" they wrote. \"We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families,\" the statement adds. \"Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed.\" Trump hasn't deleted the social media posts.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98589","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"What former ally did Trump call a 'ranting lunatic' this week?

But people who take these drugs often experience unpleasant side effects. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"They lose weight, which is a positive thing,\" says  Warren Yacawych  of the University of Michigan, \"but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment.\" So at this year's Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, Yacawych and other researchers held a session to describe their efforts to understand and solve the side-effect problem. The weight-loss products are called  GLP-1 agonists . They work by mimicking a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion. Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could tweak these drugs to suppress appetite without making people queasy. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The team focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect. \"The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center,\" Yacawych says. \"It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response.\" The second area monitors food intake and tells people when they're full. The team found a way to direct GLP-1 to the area involved in feeling full, while keeping the drug out of the vomit center. When the researchers did this, the mice no longer felt sick. But they also didn't get thin — probably because there are specific cells in the vomit center that do not induce vomiting but are critical to weight loss. \"So it's very challenging,\" Yacawych says, \"to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss.\" A possible workaround came from a team led by  Ernie Blevins  of the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone  oxytocin , which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick. Not just nausea Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst, which could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea. \"If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, that would be a problem,\" says  Derek Daniels  of the University at Buffalo. To understand how GLP-1 drugs reduce thirst, Daniels and a team began studying the brains of rats. And they got lucky. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We had a happy accident in the lab,\" Daniels says. \"And the happy accident involved a rat called the  Brattleboro rat .\" Brattleboro rats are laboratory rodents with a genetic mutation that makes them thirsty nearly all the time. But the scientists discovered that these rats are also very sensitive to GLP-1 drugs, which drastically reduced their water consumption. The team studied the rats' brains to see where GLP-1 was influencing thirst. That led them to several areas of the brain that appear to affect thirst but not appetite. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The discovery could help scientists preserve thirst by designing drugs that \"target good places but not bad places,\" Daniels says. Appetite and addiction A team from the University of Virginia found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a brain area that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a region involved in emotion and the reward system. When the researchers delivered GLP-1 to this brain area in mice, it reduced their desire for \"rewarding food, like a burger,\" says  Ali D. Güler  of the University of Virginia. But the animals continued to eat healthy, nonrewarding foods, he says — a bit like people choosing a salad bar over dessert. Identifying this brain area should help scientists find GLP-1 drugs that target the reward system while avoiding areas involved in appetite, Güler says. And that could lead to new treatments for alcoholism and other substance use disorders. The finding also could explain the observation that people who take GLP-1 agonists tend to reduce their consumption of alcohol. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are helping millions of Americans shed pounds, but these drugs affect the brain in ways that can cause nausea and other side effects. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on researchers at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego who are trying to solve this problem. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: They're called GLP-1 drugs, and they mimic a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion. Warren Yacawych of the University of Michigan says, unfortunately, nearly half the people who take the drugs feel sick. WARREN YACAWYCH: They lose weight, which is a positive thing, but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment. HAMILTON: So Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could suppress appetite without making people queasy. He says they focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect. YACAWYCH: The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center. It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response. HAMILTON: The second area monitors food intake and tells you when you're full. So the team altered mice in a way that allowed GLP-1 to reach the area involved in feeling full but not the vomit center. The mice didn't get sick, but Yacawych says they also didn't get thin - probably because certain cells in the vomit center are critical to weight loss. YACAWYCH: And so it's very challenging, we think, right now to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss. HAMILTON: One possible workaround came from researchers at the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone oxytocin, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick. Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst. Derek Daniels of the University at Buffalo says this could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea. DEREK DANIELS: If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, you can understand why that would be a problem. HAMILTON: To understand how GLP-1 drugs affect thirst, Daniels and a team began studying rats, and they got lucky. DANIELS: We had a happy accident in the lab, and the happy accident involved a rat called a Brattleboro rat. HAMILTON: This animal is thirsty pretty much all the time, except when it gets a GLP-1 drug. This led the team to the brain area causing this change. Daniels says that discovery could be important in efforts to reduce side effects from GLP-1 drugs. DANIELS: It now gives an opportunity to maybe design drugs that will target the good places and not the bad places. And I would think of a place that suppresses thirst as a bad place. HAMILTON: Another team found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a place that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a brain area involved in emotion and the reward system. Ali Guler of the University of Virginia says when GLP-1 is delivered to this brain area in mice, it doesn't affect their appetite for healthy foods. ALI GULER: But if you do the same treatment and provide them with a rewarding food like a burger, the animals have actually a reduced intake of this food. HAMILTON: It's the mouse equivalent of choosing a salad instead of dessert. And Guler says scientists should be able to develop versions of GLP-1 drugs that work the same way - by targeting the reward system while avoiding brain areas involved in appetite. GULER: If we are able to do this, then we can use it for different types of treatments, such as substance use disorder like alcoholism or drug use. HAMILTON: Doctors and researchers have already observed that people taking GLP-1 drugs for weight loss or diabetes tend to consume less alcohol. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

The Department of Transportation will consider using the dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five star-ratings once a final rule is adopted, the agency said in a news release. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men. The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man. The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women. The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said. Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags. Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements but developments have been slow. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. Sens.

Duckworth is a co-sponsor. \"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.

        Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         A federal judge on Thursday ordered an end to the monthslong National Guard deployment in Washington, D.C. to tackle crime, declaring that the use of troops was \"unlawful.\" It's the  latest legal resistance  against President Trump's troop deployments in American cities as a means to suppress protests, combat crime or safeguard federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. It comes just days after a Tennessee state judge issued a temporary block on the mobilization of Guard forces in Memphis, which was activated by the Tennessee governor at Trump's behest. Over the weekend, the Defense Department ordered  hundreds of troops to leave Chicago and Portland, Ore.  as federal courts kept those deployments at a stalemate. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, sided with District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb who had argued that the president undermined the city's autonomy, threatened public safety by stirring tensions between local residents and law enforcement and hurt the city's economy. \"The Court finds that the District's exercise of sovereign powers within its jurisdiction is irreparably harmed by Defendants' actions in deploying the Guards,\" she wrote. Cobb put a pause on her order until Dec. 11 to allow the Trump administration time to appeal. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson asserted that Trump was well within his authority to send the Guard to D.C. \"This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents — to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC,\" Jackson added. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump sent hundreds of troops to D.C. without the mayor's consent in early August after declaring a \"crime emergency\" in the city.

In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\" \"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote. Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer. Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing. \"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums. Michel obtained over $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho — also known as Jho Low — and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign. Michel also tried to end a Justice Department investigation of Low, tampered with two witnesses and perjured himself at trial, prosecutors said. Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence. \"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote. In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative AI program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5609005","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Artists Speak Out Across the Country in Fall of Freedom Campaign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to growing political pressure and fear of censorship, over 600 artists across 40 U.S. states are participating in a nationwide campaign called Fall of Freedom.

artists across the country are participating in  Fall of Freedom  — an undertaking which they say represents creative resistance to authoritarianism. More than 600 events of all sizes have been announced across more than 40 states, from Alaska to Florida. \"I think the reality is that both artists and institutions right now are feeling this fear, and we're feeling unmoored about what we are supposed to do. And the fear, I think, of being silenced starts right here, starts in our heads,\" said Eric Gottesman, a visual artist based in Washington, D.C. He is also co-executive director of  For Freedoms , an arts organization that promotes civic engagement. Gottesman and other artists around the nation say that many of their peers at cultural institutions are feeling scared and isolated, following  sweeping grant cuts  at the National Endowment for the Arts, the  firings of programming staff  at the Kennedy Center and an executive order from President Trump requiring an  audit of Smithsonian museums . In August, Trump posted on social media that museums all over the country are \"the last remaining segment of  WOKE .\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gottesman added that many large cultural institutions seem to be stuck. \"I think in this moment, when arts institutions are paralyzed by the real fear of suppression and retribution for ideas that seem critical to the kind of freedom that democracy promises, they're not able to support artists in the way that artists usually expect arts institutions to provide support . . .and so this creates a gap.\" That's where Fall of Freedom is stepping in. Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright  Lynn Nottage , one of the organizers, said she is already seeing cultural institutions decline to program work that may be targeted as controversial or politically out of step. \"What we've encountered with regard to large museums is that they feel very fearful of retribution from the government,\" she said. \"There are more nos than yeses because of anticipatory obedience. Artists aren't afraid, but the institutions are afraid, and they are beginning to make decisions based on their fear of losing grants and losing their major donors. And that trickles down to the artists who are beginning to lose opportunities. As a result, exhibitions are being canceled. Plays are not being programmed.\" The idea for Fall of Freedom originated with visual artist Dread Scott, who approached her with an idea for \"an artistic action.\" Nottage said it was a lifeline. She said she had been feeling \"very paralyzed by how quickly things were shifting in this country. I knew I wanted to respond to the rising tide of fascism, but wasn't sure how. And then when he asked me to be part of Fall of Freedom, I thought, 'Yes, this is a beautiful organizing principle.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Scott's idea was to give artists an open-ended framework in which to use their creativity to speak to this moment. \"Part of what we're doing is trying to change the dynamic where these individual institutions are trying to make decisions for their own individual survival and trying to figure out how to sort of continue to make work under fascism,\" Scott said. \"And we're trying to say, 'No, actually, let's all stand up. They might be able to pick one or two of us off, but they can't get us all if we all collectively stand together.'\" Scott observed that art has always been a catalyst in social movements and political protests. \"I tell people that, you know, what would the civil rights movement have looked like without Billie Holiday doing ' Strange Fruit' ? Or what would the resistance to fascism have looked like without Picasso painting  Guernica ?\" He added, \" The Clash  and  Public Enemy  were deeply meaningful to me as a young art student trying to make my way in a world that I could see that was really terrible. …. Those musicians gave me license to say, 'No, the world is what's crazy, not you.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Fall of Freedom came about quickly, which Chicago-based artist and activist  Jenny Kendler  says she appreciated. \"You see how long it can take to develop cultural programs,\" she said. \"If I'm doing a museum show, we're planning it two years out. But we don't have that amount of time right now. We need to be responsive to this moment.\" Along with Scott and Nottage, other marquee names participating include musician John Legend, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, choreographer Bill T. Jones, and author Ann Patchett. Communities can also participate in zine making in Homer, Alaska, see a performance of the musical  Les Miserables  in Portland, Maine, and go to a dance party in Cheyenne, Wyo. Moscow Contemporary , an arts organization in Moscow, Idaho – a city of about 27,000 people — is planning two days of events, including a roundtable discussion on civil disobedience and an open mic night. Roger Rowley, Moscow Contemporary's executive director, said he's thinking of this as just the start of a creative movement. He said you can think of the \"fall\" in the name Fall of Freedom as a decline – or as part of a cycle, or season. \"This is the  fall  of freedom,\" he said. \"And it's quite likely a winter of freedom that we're going to have to continue to struggle through. But we'll get to a spring of freedom and a summer of freedom on the other side. You put in the energy now, and you reap the rewards later.\" This story was edited  for air and digital by Jennifer Vanasco. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612255","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"In Miami Beach, the New York City mayoral election is an opportunity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of the November 2025 New York City mayoral election, where Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won a significant share of the vote—particularly among Jewish voters—Miami Beach has launched a targeted campaign to attract New York City residents and businesses.

5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MIAMI — People in New York's Times Square recently may have noticed, among the many electronic billboards, images of a beach, blue water and a caption, \"Miami Beach is open for business.\" The ads are being paid for by a Florida developer who believes the election of Democratic Socialist  Zohran Mamdani  as mayor of New York City is an opportunity to lure wealthy residents and their businesses south. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We have yet to see how the new mayor is going to do. But there's no question that there's a lot of surprise and shock,\" said  Russell Galbutt , one of Miami Beach's biggest developers.  Galbutt's ad campaign builds on messaging from Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner on  social media , which was directed at city residents unhappy with the election results. \"We're just highlighting, 'Hey, if you're looking for a law and order city with sunshine, with no state income tax, there's a lot of positives for why you should be here,'\" Meiner told NPR. \"The mayor-elect is a self-described socialist and I think there's a concern about the freedom of businesses to act as capitalist businesses need to. But there's also a concern by Jewish residents and businesses.\" Mamdani alarmed some Jewish voters because of his support for Palestinian rights and critical views of Israel. Exit polls showed Mamdani received about a third of the Jewish vote in this month's election. His office did not return a request for comment on the billboard campaign. Galbutt decided to fund an ad campaign out of frustration over what he views as economic stagnation at one of Florida's most popular resort destinations. After years of violence during spring break, which included some shootings, Miami Beach adopted  tough measures  two years ago that have been effective. But a decline in sales tax revenue and business closures since then show something else is needed, the developer said .   \"Miami Beach went into an entire campaign to tell people that we didn't want spring breakers in Miami Beach any longer,\" Galbutt said. \"But we never spent five cents or $5 on a campaign saying who we do want.\"  Meiner is more upbeat about the business climate in Miami Beach,  pointing to a $30 million revitalization project underway to boost its Lincoln Road business district.  \"We have Lamborghini ... opening up a showroom in Miami Beach. A Swiss watchmaker is coming here,\" he said. \"There's a lot of investment coming here. And we're just highlighting for people who maybe hadn't thought of Miami Beach, that they should be.\" Meiner said he's received mostly positive comments from residents about his push to attract more New Yorkers to Miami Beach.

Sprotzer, who works in real estate, noted some of the investment firms who during COVID moved their offices to South Florida, have since moved back to New York. \"I think maybe some people who are thinking about coming to South Florida, it will be a good impetus for them to do so,\" he said. \"But I don't think people who love New York are all of a sudden going to move down here.\"        \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98704","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"05:48:00+00:00","title":"Russian hacking suspect wanted by the FBI arrested on Thai resort island","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 35-year-old Russian hacker named Denis Obrezko, from Stavropol, was arrested on November 6, 2025, in Phuket, Thailand, on an international warrant issued by the FBI.

   BANGKOK — Police have arrested a suspected Russian hacker on the Thai resort island of Phuket who was wanted by the FBI on allegations he was behind cyberattacks on U.S. and European government agencies, officials said. The 35-year-old, who entered Thailand on Oct. 30 at Phuket Airport, was taken into custody earlier this month at his hotel and is now being held pending possible extradition, Thai police said. The suspect's name was not released but Russian state-run news agency Russia Today identified him as Denis Obrezko, a native of Stavropol. It reported that his relatives confirmed the Nov. 6 arrest and were planning to fight his extradition to the United States. In an e-mail Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice refused to comment on the possible extradition or give other details. The U.S. State Department and American officials in Thailand also refused to comment. The Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian embassy in Thailand also did not respond to requests for comment, but Russia's consul general in Phuket, Yegor Ivanov, told Russian state news agency Tass that the consulate had \"received notification of the arrest of a Russian citizen on charges of committing an information technology crime.\" \"He was arrested on November 6 and transferred to Bangkok that same day,\" Ivanov said, without providing further details. Ilya Ilyin, head of the consular section of the Russian embassy in Thailand, told Tass on Monday that Russian diplomats had visited the suspect in prison in Bangkok. \"Embassy staff conducted a consular visit to the Russian citizen detained at the request of the United States,\" Ilyin said, adding that the embassy was arranging for him to be able to meet with his relatives. Thailand's Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau said in a Nov. 12 statement that it was an FBI tip that the \"world-class hacker\" was traveling to Thailand that led to his arrest in Phuket on an international warrant. In the raid on his hotel, police seized laptop computers, mobile phones, and digital wallets, the police's statement said, adding that FBI officials were on hand for the arrest. Several media outlets reported that Aleksey Lukashev, a different 35-year-old Russian hacking suspect wanted by the FBI who has ties to Russian military intelligence, had been arrested in Phuket the following day. Thai police said, however, there had only been one arrest and the U.S. Department of Justice told the AP that Lukashev \"remains a wanted fugitive.\" The formal request for the Obrezko's extradition has been made but it was not clear how long the process would take. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98250","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:19:00-05:00","title":"Surf's Down!

Munich, until now an inland surfing hotspot, has lost its biggest wave \n         By Rob Schmitz \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 10:19 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MUNICH — \"It was gnarly. Dangerous. Only the most experienced could surf it,\" says Jakob Netzer of what local surfers have come to call the \"E1,\" an ever-churning wave along a mountain stream that flows through central Munich — a swell that non-surfers and tourists know as the  Eisbachwelle  or \"ice stream wave.\"   \"And it's very sad the wave is not working,\" says Netzer, staring at where the wave once regularly appeared, just below a bridge that marks the entrance to the city's English Garden.  In early November, as city engineers finished dredging the bottom of the Eisbach  —  a two-kilometer-long (1.2-mile) canal that is a side arm of the Isar River — they opened the floodgates to find the  Eisbachwelle , typically a 1.5-meter (4.9 feet) high summit of icy river water, had transformed into a small, nondescript whitewater bump along a raging waterway. \"It's usually three sections,\" says Netzer, who has surfed the  Eisbachwelle  for years. The wave stretches across all three. \"On the far side, you jump in and there are these bumps, and then in the middle, you have a nice, smoother place where you can surf, but it's not easy, because you have to anticipate the sections and know where to make the turns.\" Netzer recalls the first time he surfed the wave, at the age of 17. \"I was working in a bar and one of my bar colleagues took me to go on the Wave in the middle of the night after our shift ended,\" he remembers. \"I actually didn't think much about it, I just did it.\" It was the beginning of a surfing addiction, says Netzer. He's regularly surfed both E1 and its less challenging sibling E2, further downstream, ever since — come rain, shine, or snow, when he dons his full-body wetsuit. Fellow surfer Alexander Neumann of the Munich River Surfers' Association says over the years, the city's engineers have routinely dredged the Eisbach   canal — but they did so with greater scrutiny this year due to the  drowning death  of a surfer on the  Eisbachwelle  last April. \"They wanted to find if there are any danger zones where people could get stuck,\" he explains. \"So they took a bit too much out, which used to still lay on the ground of the wave, and the wave is not forming properly now.\" In response to questions about how the city of Munich is addressing the disappearance of the  Eisbachwelle , spokesperson Susanne Mühlbauer issued a statement to NPR: \"For Munich, the Eisbach wave is a symbol of urban sports and leisure culture, as well as a globally unique and popular tourist attraction that complements and rounds off the city's range of sights in an outstanding way — and that's why Munich Tourism hopes the Eisbach wave will return quickly.\" Down the street from where the  Eisbachwelle  used to exist, at the Technical University of Munich, hydrology professor Markus Disse opens up a textbook to a chapter on hydraulic jumps, a hydrological phenomenon that occurs along a fast-moving waterway like the Eisbach, which creates a surfable wave. Disse says a wave like the  Eisbachwelle  requires a certain water speed combined with a \"bump\" of sediment on the bottom of the stream.  Disse says he thinks the city likely removed that underwater bump. \"They did their job too good,\" he says, smiling. How to resurrect the  Eisbachwelle ? \"I would play around with the discharge,\" says Disse. \"Perhaps they should try lowering the discharge, wait half an hour, then you see the effect, and you could do a series of experiments.\" Disse says if that doesn't work, then Munich authorities should attempt to dump gravel into the canal to re-create the \"bump\" of sediment that likely created the wave in the first place. Back on the banks of the Eisbach Canal, Neumann watches an engineering team from Hamburg — hired by the city of Munich to study why the wave disappeared and in charge of bringing it back — fasten GPS and sonar equipment to a boogie board before they let it go into the river to test water flow and graph the underwater structure of the riverbed. He says he trusts that the city has the surfers' best interests in mind. Surfing along this stretch of the canal — which was owned until 2010 by the state of Bavaria — used to be illegal until the city stepped in and initiated a land swap with Bavaria in order to legalize surfing along the  Eisbachwelle.  The city's tourism board includes the site in its marketing, and Neumann says the  Eisbachwelle  has become an integral part of the city. Still, surfers have become impatient with the pace of the work to resurrect the wave. A week after it disappeared, Neumann says, a group of surfers submerged a wooden ramp where the wave once stood, and for a day, the wave came back. However, authorities deemed the ramp an illegal structure and removed it. The city continues to work on a solution.

A couple weeks ago, the wave vanished after a city dredging project. Now the community is uniting to get it back. NPR's Rob Schmitz has this report. And a warning, there is surfer lingo in his story that might be, like, a total buzzkill. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: At first, they were like, dude? And then they were like, dude. Munich surfers had lost their ride. JAKOB NETZER: It's very sad that the wave is not working. SCHMITZ: Standing by what used to be his wave, surfer Jakob Netzer (ph) is bummed. NETZER: People really are missing it because surfing is a lifestyle. SCHMITZ: Munich's wave, the Eisbachwelle, is a natural river swell, a 5-foot-high summit of water along a raging stream that bisects the city's largest park. Netzer calls the wave gnarly, dangerous. And before it disappeared, only the most experienced surfers dared to take it on. NETZER: The first time I was surfing the wave was when I was 17. I was working in a bar, and one of my bar colleagues (laughter) took me to go on the wave in the middle of the night after our shift. SCHMITZ: And why did you think that was a good idea, to come out here to the most dangerous river surfing spot and try and do it in the middle of the night? NETZER: Actually, I didn't think much about it. I don't know. We just did it. (SOUNDBITE OF DICK DALE AND HIS DEL-TONES' \"MISIRLOU\") SCHMITZ: Netzer wiped out and nearly drowned. But his throw-all-caution-to-the-wind approach is the foundation of surfing. But a river wave may not always be there for you. And on November 2, the raucous and brash surfing culture of Munich went 60 to zero, or from a Dick Dale surfing scorcher to a somber sonata from Germany's favorite composer overnight. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Last month, city engineers lowered the river and dredged it of any potential danger spots and sediment, says fellow surfer Alexander Neumann. When the engineers reopened the floodgates, the wave was gone. In its place, a foamy, unsurfably lame stretch of white water. Neumann says surfer social media groups lit up in horror. Surf is down, dudes. ALEXANDER NEUMANN: They took a bit too much out which used to lay on the ground of the wave. And the wave is not forming properly now. That's our problem. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Neumann, of the Munich River Surfers Association, stands at the riverside staring blankly at where the wave used to be. NEUMANN: It's a white water wash now because, as you can see, the water that's coming out from the two channels, it's not finding any resistance after because it's going down. And then you have the backwater that's coming. So that's why it's breaking in itself. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Just upstream, a team of engineers and a hydrologist hired from Hamburg tinker with GPS and sonar equipment they're attaching to a boogie board. The city, it appears, is addressing an engineering mishap by throwing more engineers at it - a German solution to a German problem. MARKUS DISSE: They did their job too good (laughter). SCHMITZ: Hydrologist Markus Disse teaches down the street at the Technical University of Munich. He suggests the city instead experiment with the flow of the water while replacing some of the sediment to resurrect the wave. He opens a hydrology book to a page on fluid mechanics to explain what's called the Froude number. DISSE: I can give you the formula if you like. (SOUNDBITE OF LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN'S \"PIANO SONATA NO. 14\") SCHMITZ: Dude, no. DISSE: So velocity divided by square root of gravity constant times the water height. SCHMITZ: And if, he says, the city adds sediment and increases the velocity of the water, then the Froude number increases and the height of the wave should, too. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING) SCHMITZ: All this hydrological engineering talk made Munich surfers impatient, though. A week after the wave vanished, they MacGyvered an underwater ramp and secretly installed it where the wave used to be, and voila, the wave came back. (SOUNDBITE OF DICK DALE AND HIS DEL-TONES' \"MISIRLOU\") SCHMITZ: Yes, it was illegal, and yes, the city was not happy about the stunt, and it was removed. But for a day or two, surfers were again riding the Eisbachwelle, where the surf was back up, dude. Rob Schmitz, NPR News, Munich.

November 21, 2025 • 5:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         With names like neodymium and dysprosium, rare-earth elements sound exotic — and their perceived scarcity has only added to the mystique. In reality, rare earths aren't that rare, but just difficult to extract and refine. Yet they've become indispensable to modern life, embedded in everything from our smartphones and electric-vehicle motors to wind turbines and medical imaging machines. And demand is climbing. The real choke point is processing and refining — a complex and environmentally sensitive step that the U.S. has lagged behind in and that China now dominates, controlling  nearly 90%  of global output. The need for high-torque, compact EV motors — which use rare-earth magnets that are three to four times stronger than conventional magnets — is helping drive demand. Production of these motors is soaring by  roughly a third each year . Military aircraft also rely heavily on these elements; one  RAND  estimate suggests an F-35 contains over 900 pounds of rare-earth materials in its engines and electronics. Taking a private-public approach To reduce reliance on foreign supply, the White House is pursuing U.S. self-sufficiency in rare-earth production. The federal government under President Trump has supported the sector in ways that depart from traditional free-market principles. Rather than relying solely on private industry, the federal government has followed a strategy similar to China's, providing hundreds of millions in loans and even taking stakes in key mines and startups. Indiana-based ReElement Technologies is among the beneficiaries of this government backing. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced a partnership between the Pentagon, via its  Office of Strategic Capital  (OSC), ReElement and Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina based firm that produces rare-earth magnets for military applications. ReElement says it has developed a more efficient, environmentally friendly method of rare-earth processing and recycling that involves chromatography. The company operates a commercialization facility in Noblesville, Ind., with a larger production site in Marion, Ind., slated to come online next year. ReElement Technologies CEO Mark Jensen says confidently that by the end of 2026, \"we'll be the largest producer of rare earth oxides in the United States.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Because China's dominance in refining is so great, the U.S. benchmark for success is modest, according to Bert Donnes, a research analyst at investment banking firm William Blair. ReElement, in partnership with Vulcan Elements, aims in the next few years to produce 10,000 metric tons of neodymium-iron-boron magnets used not only in EVs, but also wind-turbine generators, hard-disk drives and MRI machines. Even that ambitious target is a fraction of the approximately 230,000 tons produced globally in 2024, according to the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , or IEEE. \"I would say if you see those numbers, you think this is going to be a massive facility,\" says Donnes of ReElement's current operation. \"It isn't.\" Compared to a traditional processing facility, ReElement's operation is compact, he says, helping avoid any \"not-in-my-backyard\" (NIMBY) backlash. \"So it's not like people are scared of this process. Maybe they don't know about it as much because you can keep the process so small,\" he says. How the U.S. lost its lead Starting in the 1980s,  China began surging ahead  of the U.S. and the rest of the world in rare earth production. Around the same time, environmental concerns mounted at the only major U.S. rare earth mine, Mountain Pass in California, where spills of radioactive and toxic wastewater — byproducts of refining — raised alarms. Mountain Pass is an open-cut mine where they \"drill and blast, blend their types and locations in the pit\" before grinding the solid materials into smaller particles, according to Kelton Smith, a lead process engineer for mining at Tetra Tech, a global consulting and engineering services firm. A flotation process then concentrates the rare earths that are in turn leached with hydrochloric acid. The California mine had to halt production multiple times over the years due to environmental concerns. During that time, it changed ownership and ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection before being acquired by MP Materials in 2017, which reopened the mine. The troubles at Mountain Pass helped China to gain a foothold and eventually overtake the U.S. in rare earths — just as demand for them was rising. Beijing now produces about 60% of the world's supply of these substances, according to the  International Energy Agency . China also holds a substantial amount of the world's proven reserves of the ores that contain these elements — roughly 34%, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but several other countries — including the U.S. — have substantial reserves as well. Trump's trade war with China has made the squeeze in rare earths even more acute. Because the U.S. lacks the ability to process rare earths on a large scale, MP Materials has had to send its ore from Mountain Pass to China for refining.  But no more . Instead, the company is having to ramp up its limited capability to process the ore on-site. Further complicating the issue are expanded  export controls that Beijing announced last month  that require foreign companies to obtain a license in order to sell products overseas that contain Chinese-sourced rare earths. Aaron Mintzes is deputy policy director and counsel at Earthworks, a national group focused on preventing the adverse impacts of mineral and energy development. \"What we're urging … is to do that processing in ways that reduce energy and water intensity and toxicity,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Brent Elliott, a research associate professor of geology at the University of Texas, estimates the U.S. has sufficient resources to meet demand. \"It's about the extraction potential and the logistics of getting it out of the ground in a way that is environmentally sensitive but also socially responsible,\" he says. Partly because it is environmentally messy, with toxic byproducts, Beijing has gained an advantage by ignoring those consequences. \"China can do it faster and better because they don't have the environmental concerns that we have,\" Elliott says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many experts agree that the U.S. has enough reserves but lacks the processing capability to go along with it. Simon Jowitt, a geologist and the director of the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, says there are a number of rare earth deposits in the U.S. that have potential, but it's rarely a straightforward proposition. \"You need a source of the rare earths, some way of transporting the rare earths, some way of concentrating the rare earths, and some way of putting those rare earths into a form that they can then be extracted,\" Jowitt says. \"If you don't have one of those, then you end up with something that isn't a mineral deposit and you'll never get anything out of it.\" Last year, China decreed  new regulations  for rare earth processing that include strict environmental and safety regulations, but it remains to be seen how stringent enforcement will be. Meanwhile, it not only processes its own ore, but it imports raw ore from places like Southeast Asia and Africa. It's part of a broader strategy by China to set itself up as a global hub for rare earths, according to Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"They put a lot of state resources behind building processing capabilities, such that the minerals come from different places and then they get sent to China for refining,\" Baskaran says. \"What China has been extraordinarily good at is connecting their foreign policy to secure rare earths from around the world.\" A new process and federal investments Refining is where ReElement comes in. The company uses large columns in a specialized filtration process developed at Purdue University to extract and purify valuable metals from raw ore, but also recycled rare earths from old magnets. The process is more efficient and less environmentally damaging than older methods, such as those used by China. Jensen, the ReElement CEO, says that method, known as solvent extraction, is \"ecologically challenging\" and difficult to scale. \"It's a dead technology,\" he says, adding that his company's ultimate goal isn't necessarily to achieve U.S. dominance, but to produce enough rare earths domestically to break China's monopoly. The One Big Beautiful Bill passed in July  appropriated $7.5 billion  toward securing critical minerals. Days later, the Pentagon's Office of Strategic Capital announced a  $400 million investment  in MP Materials , making the U.S. government the company's largest shareholder. The Pentagon agency  plans  further investments in \"[c]ritical components, raw materials, and rare earth elements utilized in microelectronic manufacturing.\" As part of the deal with ReElement, Vulcan Elements will get a $620 million loan from the Pentagon's OSC with an additional $50 million provided by the Department of Commerce under  the CHIPS and Science Act  signed by former President Joe Biden. ReElement Technologies will receive an $80 million loan to support the expansion of its recycling and processing operations. \"I think we're making big strides now because of all the grants and all the critical-mineral-focused grants coming out,\" says Elliott, the University of Texas geology professor. \"I think it really can set us up for success.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5615040","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"17:10:00-05:00","title":"The CDC revives debunked 'link' between childhood vaccines and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reversed its long-standing position by updating its website to suggest that a link between childhood vaccines and autism cannot be ruled out.

The CDC's website now says a link between vaccines and autism  cannot be ruled out . That's a reversal from the CDC's longstanding stance that there is no link. The change comes even though a connection between vaccines and autism has long been debunked by a large body of high-quality research. But Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has  long promoted the discredited claim . The CDC's change is alarming public health experts. They are already worried about a drop in childhood vaccination, which has led to a resurgence of dangerous childhood diseases like measles and whooping cough. \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has been changed to promote false information suggesting vaccines cause autism,\" said Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement. \"Since 1998, independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people. The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There's no link between vaccines and autism.\" She went on to say, \"Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents. We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.\" In a statement to NPR, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon repeated one of the changes to the website: \"The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.\" He said the department \"has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\" \"The new statement shows a lack of understanding of the term 'evidence,'\" the  Autism Science Foundation  said in a statement the organization provided to NPR, adding, \"No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines.\" It's a statement that's confusing by design, said  Dr. Paul Offitt , a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"These are the usual anti-vaccine tropes, misrepresentation of studies, false equivalence,\" he says. \"They might as well say chicken nuggets might cause autism because you can't prove that either.\" The changes on the website \"blindsided\" career scientists at CDC, says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former top CDC official who resigned from the agency in August. \"The scientists did not participate in its creation,\" he says. \"And the data are unvetted.\" Two current CDC staffers, who contacted NPR Thursday, say the updates are a glaring red flag that indicate the vaccine information on the agency website is no longer credible, and is instead \"anti-science.\" They requested anonymity out of concern they could lose their jobs for speaking to the press. The moves are the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines that run counter to mainstream medical and scientific organizations like the pediatrics academy, the Infectious Disease Society of American and the American College of Physicians. Vaccine proponents say the moves are recklessly undermining public confidence in vaccines and fueling vaccine hesitancy, putting the nation's children at risk. The U.S. appears to be poised to  lose its status as having eliminated measles . Kennedy sacked all the members of the CDC's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, earlier this year and replaced the members with his own slate. In one of its first actions, the new advisory committee called for the removal of the preservative thimerosal used in a small fraction of flu vaccines, even though safety concerns about it have also been debunked. Under Kennedy, federal health agencies have also made it harder for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and canceled grants funding new vaccines that rely on mRNA technology at the heart of the most used COVID vaccines. The Trump administration has also claimed there is a link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism, and promoted the use of leucovorin, a prescription form of vitamin B9, to treat autism  even though the evidence supporting that is scant . An ACIP working group is now studying more major changes in childhood vaccinations, including removing compounds that  include aluminum used to increase vaccine effectiveness . These adjuvants have been used safely for nearly a century. The committee is also exploring  separating a single shot now given to protect against measles, mumps and rubella in a single shot  into individual shots. Public health experts say both moves are scientifically unsound and would essentially upend the nation's childhood vaccination regimen, leaving children vulnerable to diseases that had long been brought under control. The committee is also  considering recommending delaying vaccinating children against hepatitis B . For years, all babies have been vaccinated against hepatitis at birth. Hepatitis B can cause liver failure and liver cancer. The CDC acknowledges in a footnote on its main webpage on autism and vaccines that it still carries a header reading \"Vaccines do not cause autism*\" and says it hasn't \"been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.\" NPR emailed Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy's office for comment but didn't receive an immediate response. Cassidy chairs the Senate HELP Committee, which vetted Kennedy's nomination to lead HHS and voted along party lines to support it. Cassidy  posted on X Thursday afternoon : \"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   There has been a major change in the U.S. government's policy on vaccines and autism. For years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been very clear. Vaccines do not cause autism. But now its website suggests that they might. Scientists within the CDC reject the change, and they say they were not involved in making it. Activists who question the safety of vaccines are thrilled. NPR's Pien Huang is here to tell us more. Hi. PIEN HUANG, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: Hey there. So just start by telling us what changes are you seeing on the CDC's website today? HUANG: So a web page that previously said vaccines do not cause autism has been amended. It now essentially says vaccines might cause autism and science hasn't proven that they don't. And it also describes the state of the evidence as lacking and says that the federal government will be investing more money to study this. Now, to be clear, there is no new evidence linking vaccines with autism. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former top official at CDC, says the research has been very clear for years. DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Every scientist in the world who is not a conspiracy theorist, who has not been discredited, who has not had their medical license taken away, every scientist knows that vaccines do not cause autism. HUANG: The Autism Science Foundation, which funds autism research, says that the science on autism points to other factors like genetics, family history, exposure to a lot of air pollution or certain fever-inducing illnesses during pregnancy - again, not vaccines. SUMMERS: OK. So then why is this showing up on the CDC's website now? HUANG: So Daskalakis and others point to leadership. The current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is someone who has long been critical of vaccines. He's written books claiming that their dangers have been covered up by the government, and he used to lead an influential activist group, Children's Health Defense, that's advanced these causes. Today, that group's CEO, Mary Holland, celebrated the changes. Here she is talking in a video on the group's website. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARY HOLLAND: Here we are seeing the CDC, the most prestigious medical public health organization in the world, saying out loud, we lied for 30 years. That's remarkable. It's really remarkable. HUANG: Holland said that her group has been working for years to promote their view that vaccines are the main cause of the autism epidemic, and many members of her group have children with autism, and they feel that their concerns have been ignored. Now, Holland has said that these changes would not have happened without Kennedy, who, as health secretary, has been putting former colleagues in positions of power throughout the federal government's vaccine program. And at the same time, Kennedy has been barring the CDC's career scientists from speaking directly with the public. Some told me that they are now worried they work for an anti-science organization, and they said this is a major escalation of what Kennedy has been doing for months. SUMMERS: Say more about that. What are they specifically referring to? HUANG: Yeah. So as health secretary, Kennedy has been sowing doubts about vaccine safety. Earlier this year, during a big measles outbreak in Texas which killed two children, Kennedy went on Fox News and said that the measles vaccines kills people every year, gives them the same symptoms you get from measles. That is not true. He's also been making changes to how vaccine policy gets made. So he stacked a CDC vaccine advisory committee with people known for their unorthodox views, who have been raising unsupported conspiracy theories at public meetings, and they've already made some changes to policies for flu and COVID vaccines. That same advisory committee is meeting in two weeks, where they're expected to make more changes to the vaccine schedule. So that's something we'll be watching closely. SUMMERS: NPR's Pien Huang, thank you. HUANG: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/spain-attorney-general-guilty-trial-0baa0c0d9dc5949fcec73106d9678045","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"13:52:27Z","title":"Spain’s Supreme Court Bans Attorney General Over Leaked Personal Information","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Spain’s Supreme Court has banned Attorney General Álvaro García Ortiz from office for two years after finding him guilty of leaking confidential information about Alberto González Amador, the boyfriend of opposition leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

The court banned Attorney General Álvaro García Ortiz from his post for two years in a split vote of 5-2. The decision is a blow to Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who defended García Ortiz during the monthslong investigation and trial. Spain’s government said that it “respected the decision but does not share it.” García Ortiz was accused of having leaked an email to journalists and written a press release with personal information about Alberto González Amador, when the businessman was under investigation for alleged tax fraud. That tax inquiry remains open. González Amador is the partner of Madrid’s influential regional leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso, one of Spain’s main opposition leaders. García Ortiz denied any wrongdoing. He can appeal to the Constitutional Court. In addition to being removed from his post, the court ordered that he pay 7,200 euros ($8,300) in fines, 10,000 euros ($11,500) in damages to González Amador and the court fees.

That requires taking care of herself, too \n         By Juana Summers, Alejandra Marquez Janse, Sarah Handel \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         At age 43, Dawnita Brown made a life-changing pivot. She took leave from her secure government job, winnowed down her possessions, resolved her financial responsibilities, and in 2016, signed up for the Peace Corps. Volunteering in Eswatini was \"amazing,\" she says — so much so that she planned to extend her time abroad in a paid position with the Peace Corps after her service ended. She didn't know she was about to make another pivot. In 2018, her mom, Joan Cain, had a stroke in her brain stem. Brown rushed home to Baltimore, preparing herself to say goodbye. Instead, her mom recovered, but with a challenging prognosis. \"So, I became her proxy,\" Brown says, and she stayed by Cain's side through rehabilitation and nursing facilities. Eventually, concerns about the quality of her mother's care led Brown to step away from her job, take her mom home and care for her herself, full time. A huge number of today's 65-year-olds — more than  two-thirds  — will likely need some kind of long-term care as they age, whether it's in-home care, assisted living or a nursing home. Those services can  easily  cost more each year  than what the  average American  makes. And health insurers — both government and private — may not provide the necessary coverage. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That leaves many people to rely on unpaid family caregivers whose care  AARP valued at $600 billion  in 2021. That's more than half a trillion dollars worth of work done by people like Dawnita Brown. As a household, Brown makes caregiving financially feasible through a patchwork of coverage, including Medicare, supplemental insurance and her mom's pension. And she's debt free thanks to the work she put in readying herself for the Peace Corps. \"I haven't had a steady income in almost 10 years,\" says Brown. \"I haven't paid into retirement. But I don't want for anything.\" 'It's a gift' Brown's   home is warm and inviting, much like herself. The brick row house is tastefully appointed with meaningful family artifacts and photographs, meticulously clean without feeling sterile. On the day we visited, Brown had just returned from taking her dad, Bill Lee Brown, to physical therapy. She cares for him, too. Although Bill and Joan are not a couple, he moved into the home in 2024 after complications from his multiple myeloma diagnosis made it hard for him to live alone. So, while her mom's upstairs, her dad is downstairs. Between them, doing countless flights of stairs a day, Dawnita Brown is holding it all together. Meting out prescriptions, preparing meals, scheduling appointments and calling for help when it's more than one person can handle. Caregiving is a role she didn't expect, but one she has leaned all the way into. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2021, Brown founded a community for fellow caregivers called the  Binti Circle . The name comes from the word for daughter in Swahili. \"I started Binti because it was the community I needed and did not have,\" she says. They meet monthly, have outings and events, all with the goal of making a difference in the lives of caregivers, reducing stress and providing safety in community. That way, Brown says, \"you have more skills and tools that you need for this gift of caregiving, because it's a gift to be able to care for your parent, even though it's hard.\" She says it was especially important to her to focus on Black daughters in caregiving roles. \"The daughter holds it together,\" says Brown, even in difficult situations. \"Looking at the fragility of your parent, processing the grief of losing the parent that you knew … that your mom doesn't know you.\" She adds, \"and you know what's even more challenging are those daughters that are caring for parents that did not parent them.\" In the Binti Circle, she has gathered \"a community of daughters that understand and can empathize, with no judgment.\" One of Binti's — and Brown's — core values is the importance of respite for caregivers. \"You know, most people think about self-care as nails and hair and massages,\" she says. Brown does those things, but taking care of herself also  includes regular doctor's appointments and therapy, and simpler things, too. \"It's breathing, just sometimes laying in my bed and breathing. And my devotionals, I always set the tone before I get out of bed.\" And as positive and motivated as Brown is, she does feel down sometimes. \"Yesterday I was feeling kind of yucky,\" she says. \"And so I got up and I found a … 'boost your mood' yoga workout.\" She has also built herself her own little getaway at home — an outdoor deck space furnished with thrifted and upcycled finds, succulents and a fire pit. She calls it her oasis. \"You are responsible for people,\" says Brown, so, \"if you're no good, they're no good. And so, that's why I work very hard to take care of myself.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Ailsa Chang in Washington. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   And I'm Juana Summers in Baltimore, where, at a brick row house, we're greeted by this woman with infectious energy and a huge, bright smile. Hello. DAWNITA BROWN: Oh, hi. SUMMERS: Hey. How are you doing? D BROWN: Good. And you? SUMMERS: I'm well. Thank you for having us in your home. D BROWN: Of course. SUMMERS: Dawnita Brown welcomes us with hugs, and one of the first things we notice about her is her black hooded sweatshirt. It says family caregivers do the most and love the best. Her house is really warm and inviting, and you can hear a TV faintly playing. D BROWN: I want to make sure that I have pieces of her and my grandmother, if you will. Some of this furniture is my grandmother's. So these are from her home, and my mom actually did that painting there. SUMMERS: Oh, wow. D BROWN: You can see her name, Joan. SUMMERS: The painting is of a pair of praying hands framed by a beam of light. Brown then leads us into the kitchen. D BROWN: So I'm just getting in with my dad. He had physical therapy. And so, typically, check on my mom, make sure she's OK, and then get him something to eat. She's eating. Her girlfriend just left, so she was here to watch her. We - it takes a village while we, you know, went to take my dad. So next is getting him something to eat. SUMMERS: She reaches into the refrigerator, and she pulls out a container filled with French toast and sausage. It's a meal made by a friend. Are you able to get a lot of help from folks in your community or friends or family? D BROWN: So my aunt picked up the medication today, the prescriptions. And then my mother's friend - she came over today to sit with my mom while I took him to therapy. But on a day-to-day, it's just me. SUMMERS: The elder care system here in the U.S. is daunting. Whether it's in-home care, assisted living or a nursing home, a huge number of today's 65-year-olds - more than two-thirds - will likely need some kind of long-term care as they age. Those services can easily cost more each year than the average American makes, and health insurers, both government and private, may not provide the coverage you need. That leaves many people to rely on unpaid family caregivers. According to AARP, in 2021, they accounted for about $600 billion in unpaid labor annually. That is more than half a trillion dollars' worth of work, done by people like Dawnita Brown, every year for free. To the extent that there is a typical day for Dawnita Brown, this is what it looks like, caring for two aging parents in the same home, their rooms separated by flights of stairs. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS) D BROWN: OK. SUMMERS: Upstairs, there's her mother, Joan, who had a brainstem stroke in 2018. Downstairs, there's Dawnita's father, Bill, who moved in last year. And now, navigating between those floors and navigating the needs of her two parents, Dawnita is the glue that holds everything together. Before she became a full-time caregiver, Brown was on leave from her job at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, serving in the Peace Corps in Eswatini. When she learned that her mother had a stroke, she rushed back to the U.S. D BROWN: I thought I was just coming home to say my goodbyes to her. SUMMERS: Her mother survived that stroke, though, with a challenging prognosis. D BROWN: From a cognitive standpoint, she couldn't really process anything for herself, so I became her proxy. SUMMERS: Dawnita Brown's mother initially did stints at a rehab facility, and she was transferred to a nursing home. But ultimately, Brown was not satisfied with her mother's care, so she decided to bring her home and take on caring for her herself, full-time. And last year, Brown's father returned from LA to Baltimore too. He was unable to care for himself independently after a cancer diagnosis. Part of how she's able to navigate life as a full-time family caregiver for both of them is that she'd already downsized and cut her personal debt. D BROWN: I haven't had a steady income in almost 10 years. I haven't paid into retirement, but I don't want for anything. SUMMERS: Can you just walk us through how you make the finances of being able to care for both of your parents work? How does the math make sense? D BROWN: My mother is on Medicare. They're both on Medicare and have supplemental insurances. My mom's pension helps with her supplies, her monthly supplies. She has great insurance as a retired federal employee. She's kind of grandfathered into an amazing plan where she doesn't have any copays or coinsurance. Her prescriptions are covered with that, and that's taken out of her pension. My dad - like, I'm blessed because both of my parents were fiscally responsible, if you will. So I would say I'm in a unique position. SUMMERS: Dawnita Brown is intentional about everything, methodical about how she plans care for her parents but also about how she cares for herself. As we talk, she repeatedly brings up the idea of respite. D BROWN: It's breathing, just sometimes just staying in bed and breathing, and my devotionals. I always set the tone before I get out of bed. Yesterday, I was feeling kind of yucky. You know, you get those moments. And so I got up and I found a yoga - boost your mood yoga workout that I did. You know what I mean? So I try to do those things, as well as I stay up on my annual checkups and physicals and therapy. There's been an uptick. You know, most people think about self-care as nails and hair and massages. I do those, too. You know, I'm going to get my nails done Friday (laughter) and going to the dermatologist. Like, I make sure that the basics - you know, like I said, my well checks are done, as well as doing things that I know that make me feel good. SUMMERS: Brown also has built a community of fellow caregivers. It's called the Binti Circle. The name comes from the word for daughter in Swahili. The group first met in February 2021, just nine people. And every month since, they've kept meeting, their numbers growing. D BROWN: I started Binti because it was the community that I needed and did not have. And we meet monthly. We have quarterly outings, respite with rhythms and letting go with laughter. So, you know, we build in comedy shows and music, live music outings. We try to make sure that there is impact, that it's making a difference, that stress levels are reduced, that you feel safe in community. You have more skills and tools that you need for this gift of caregiving. Because it's a gift, like, to be able to care for your parent, even though it's hard. SUMMERS: And I know that the Binti Circle focuses specifically on Black daughter caregivers. Why was that focus so important to you? D BROWN: It was important because it's the Black daughter - and this is just what I knew, not even when I started to do research. This is just what I knew is, like, the daughter holds it together. And so, as a Black woman, with the health disparities and just how we are just disproportionately affected by so much, I felt like it was important for us to have that space. And caring for a parent is different. Like I say, looking at the fragility of your parent, processing the grief of losing the parent that you knew, processing that you won't be able to have the conversations with your mom that you did before - right? - processing that your mom doesn't know you. You know what I mean? So that's why I felt like we need this community, too, 'cause, to be honest, you know, sometimes when we have things, it's not easy, right? And you want to share how you really feel and be - we're a safe space. We know - I say it, like, girl - like what my mother sometimes say - I say girl, if you did not treat me good, you would be dead by now, 'cause she drives me crazy. And so we're able to share those stories and laugh about them because it's real. It's really - and you know what's even more challenging are those daughters that are caring for parents that did not parent them. SUMMERS: Ooh. D BROWN: So having a community of daughters that understand and can empathize with you with no judgment, that's important, right? SUMMERS: She walks us up this narrow staircase that leads to her mother's bedroom, and she and Bill are hanging out there. And a game show, \"The 1% Club,\" is playing on the TV. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE 1% CLUB\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: What did you put? SUMMERS: She tells us that another goal for her as a caregiver and a daughter is to continue creating memories, to try to celebrate her parents now while they're still here. Hanging on the bedroom door is the outfit for her mother's casino-themed 75th birthday party. Her mother's reclining, resting in bed, and her father sits in an armchair near the foot of the bed with a fleece Baltimore Ravens blanket draped over the top. Good afternoon. How are you doing today? (SOUNDBITE OF ITEMS RUSTLING) BILL BROWN: Doing fine. And how are you ladies doing? SUMMERS: We're well. Thank you. D BROWN: Ma. Ma. Ma. SUMMERS: Oh. It's OK. D BROWN: Wake up. You don't want to wake up? SUMMERS: We chat for a little bit, and then head back down the stairs, slipping on our shoes before we head out. And as we do, Dawnita Brown is already looking ahead. She's holding an orange pill bottle in her hand. It's time now to fill the pill boxes to make sure that both of her parents have the care that they need. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SUMMERS: November is National Family Caregivers Month, and we have more of our reporting coming for you next week. Jennifer Levin (ph) unexpectedly became a caregiver for her father when she was just 32. JENNIFER LEVIN: I had never even stepped into a nursing home before. SUMMERS: Like Dawnita Brown, she found herself in need of a community that understood her situation. Specifically for Levin, that meant the challenges of being a caregiver as a millennial. LEVIN: You are thinking about, well, how am I going to date when I'm also responsible for somebody at home? How can I explain to somebody what I do and that there's always a priority that's going to usurp our plans? How can I have children? Can I afford it if I'm caregiving? Do I have the time? SUMMERS: Jennifer Levin joins us with her best advice for millennial caregivers coming up next week.

Spread throughout the  roughly 23,000 documents  released by the House Oversight Committee last week, emails and texts show Epstein courted prominent politicos from both sides of the aisle, impressed academics and used his connections to push back on negative stories about his alleged crimes. Epstein's career as a wealthy financier who gave money to universities and other causes put him in many elite circles. Those circles did not entirely close to him after  he pleaded guilty  to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 in 2008. Reading through the text messages and emails released, the people who consulted with Epstein rarely acknowledged the severity of the crimes that required him to register as a sex offender, though simply corresponding with Epstein does not implicate individuals in his criminal activities, convicted or accused. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There's an  apparent letter of recommendation  for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky, calling him a \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — another frequent Epstein correspondent. \"Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues,\" the letter reads. There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement overseas. \"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, [E]urope by remote doesn't work,\" Epstein wrote in 2018. \"Lots and lots of face time and hand holding. Europe can be a wife not a mistress.\" Former Harvard University president and onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is documented numerous times having intimate personal chats with Epstein, including asking for romantic advice and joking about women's intelligence. \"I yipped about inclusion,\"  wrote Summers in 2017 . \"I observed that half the IQ [in the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\" Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 after arguing that women may be innately less capable in math and science. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the week since the latest Epstein emails release, he has resigned from the board of OpenAI and  abruptly left his teaching role  at Harvard, as the university  announced a probe  of \"information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\" Summers isn't the only high-profile Democrat who found themself in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel in the Obama administration and current chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs, messaged with Epstein before and during Trump's first term. \"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" she wrote in August 2015. \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told  The Wall Street Journal  in 2023. More than a thousand mentions of Trump Trump promised to release the Epstein files on the campaign trail but largely stonewalled the effort this year since he returned to office, frequently calling the push for more transparency around the Epstein case a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. In a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing the signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump said Democrats were using the issue to distract from what he says are victories for his administration. \"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he  posted . The president has the authority to release the files without congressional action. Trump is a frequent subject of emails and text messages in the latest file tranche — well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates. This week, after an abrupt reversal that led to the near-unanimous approval of the  Epstein Files Transparency Act , the president has now called for Democrats mentioned in Epstein's communications to be investigated by the Justice Department. \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Other Republicans are going on the offensive too — highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a  House Oversight Committee hearing  with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in 2019. Comparing the newly released messages with the video of the hearing, minutes after Epstein suggested Plaskett ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization, Plaskett posed similar questions. An effort to censure Plaskett in the House failed Tuesday. In a floor speech, Plaskett defended her actions as receiving information from a constituent and said it was \"not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation.\" Amid the partisan finger-pointing around the Epstein files, some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people that they say haven't faced scrutiny — regardless of political party. What's next for the government's Epstein files? Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format. That includes information that relates to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and \"individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities.\" There's also a focus on information regarding plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein for other alleged crimes, as well as documents pertaining to his 2019 death by suicide in federal custody. Over the summer, the  FBI put out a memo  that said their files include \"a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence.\" Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and disturbing material that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\" can be withheld or redacted, too. With Trump's ordering of the investigation into Democrats and financial institutions mentioned in the Epstein correspondence, it is unclear how much of the Justice Department's files will be released, to what extent they will be redacted and when they ultimately will be made public. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Now that President Trump has signed the bill that directs the Department of Justice to release files relating to Jeffrey Epstein, there's renewed focus on the documents that already have been released and what they say about the president. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   In thousands of pages that are now public, other powerful people were revealed to keep close ties to Epstein even after he became a registered sex offender. FADEL: NPR's Stephen Fowler has been sifting through everything that's already out there and is with me now. Good morning. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So what do these files tell us about the people who associated with Jeffrey Epstein before he died? FOWLER: The long and the short of it here, Leila, is that there are a ton of rich and powerful people that sought counsel from Epstein. Academics, lawyers, politicians, you name it. Reading through these emails, for much of these conversations, you'd never know he was already accused of sex-related crimes with underage girls. There's an apparent letter of recommendation for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky that calls him a, quote, \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who also emailed with Epstein frequently. There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement in Europe. Former Harvard president and one-time U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is stepping away from his public responsibilities after being documented in these files asking Epstein for romantic advice. The list goes on and on. FADEL: Now, President Trump still calls the demands to release the Epstein files a, quote, \"hoax.\" So if it's a hoax, why is he using it to attack Democrats? FOWLER: It is worth remembering that Trump is mentioned quite frequently in these documents. Epstein appeared obsessed with Trump and his presidency and trying to tell powerful people that he was this sort of Trump whisperer because of their onetime friendship. But plenty of high-profile Democrats have been in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. And Trump is directing the Justice Department to investigate links between Democrats like former President Bill Clinton, Summers and megadonor Reid Hoffman. Other Republicans are going on the offensive, too, highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic member of Congress Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands during a 2019 committee hearing with Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. Text messages show that Epstein teed up Plaskett to ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization. And you can see on the video of the hearing that those questions come a few minutes later. But some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people they say haven't faced scrutiny, regardless of political affiliation. FADEL: Now, after the near unanimous approval in Congress of a measure that would direct the Justice Department to release files related to Epstein, what else could we learn that's different from these estate files? FOWLER: Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make, quote, \"all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format. That relates to things like Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, travel records, individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, information about plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein and his death by suicide. Over the summer, the FBI put out a memo that said those files include a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence. Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's victims, including minors, that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything jeopardizing a federal investigation can be withheld, too. And Trump did just announce a new federal investigation. So, Leila, it's not clear what files will be released and when. FADEL: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thank you, Stephen. FOWLER: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5614949","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:13:00-05:00","title":"These families' health care costs will balloon if Congress doesn't act on the ACA","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that the failure of Congress to extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans will result in a 26% average increase in health insurance premiums by 2026, the largest rise since 2018.

will balloon if Congress doesn't act on the ACA \n         By Carmel Wroth, Aru Nair \n        \n           Thursday, November 20, 2025 • 12:13 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The government shutdown has ended without resolving a fight over health insurance. Congress failed to extend enhanced tax credits that have helped millions of Americans on Affordable Care Act plans cover their plan costs since 2021. Senate Republicans have promised a vote on the enhanced subsidies before the end of the year. But open enrollment for these plans is already underway and consumers are facing sky-high prices and little certainty about whether they'll get relief. And making matters worse, insurers have raised prices on these plans because they predict that without the tax credits, healthier people may not sign up in 2026, leaving them a  sicker, costlier pool of customers . Premiums on the marketplaces are rising by an average of 26% next year,  according to health policy organization KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. There's less than a month to go before the Dec. 15 deadline to sign up for a plan that begins Jan. 1. If Congress doesn't act before then, some people may have to choose between paying far more than they're comfortable with or forgoing insurance altogether. Here are their stories: She \"can't swing\" an extra $1,000 a month Amy Jackson, Butler, Mo. Amy Jackson, 56, works in medical billing at an independent urgent care center. She buys coverage on the ACA marketplace because her employer is too small to have health benefits. She says her current premiums are affordable for her at $275 a month but will go to $1,250 in 2026 without the tax credit. Going without insurance is really not an option for her. In October, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. So she's rushing to get in as much treatment as she can before the year ends, but she'll still need coverage for follow-up appointments next year. Since she works in the medical field, she says she knows the insurance industry is part of the problem here. But she says people like her need help now, and lawmakers need to understand that. \"For them, a thousand bucks is probably nothing. It's probably what they blow on dinner. But for me, that's half of my wage,\" she says. \"I just can't swing that.\" \"A very daunting amount of money\" for a retiree Robert Bixon, Boynton Beach, Fla. A 61-year-old retiree, Robert Bixon, faces 2026 premiums of $4,500 a month to cover himself, his wife, and one of his sons. That's $54,000 a year, plus potentially spending up to $15,000 for their out-of-pocket maximum. Bixon says he knew he'd have to pay for health care out of pocket after retiring from his career as a small business owner. \"But,\" he says, \"in my wildest dreams, I never thought a number close to $70,000 a year would be the cost that I'd be facing.\" \"It's a very daunting amount of money,\" he says. What scares Bixon even more is that prices could keep going up: \"Twelve months from now, we could be having the same conversation and I could be looking at another 20% or 30% increase.\" \"I wonder if I'm going to be able to live out my days and enjoy my retirement and not run out of money,\" he says. Still, Bixon isn't willing to risk living without insurance before becoming eligible for Medicare at 65. He has spent his entire adult life saving and investing for retirement and says he \"can't risk getting wiped out by long-term hospitalization.\" \"I just don't understand how the leadership in this country can find that acceptable for working-class Americans — people who started businesses, helped employ other people, paid taxes — now [are] looking at these kinds of health care costs,\" he says. Fears losing access to treatment for his bipolar disorder Ezra McKay, Memphis, Tenn. Ezra McKay, 26, works part-time as a bookseller. He was kicked off his mother's plan, and his employer won't give him enough hours to get on the employer plan. So he buys his own insurance on the ACA marketplace. He has bipolar disorder and the insurance, which covers his doctors' visits and prescriptions, has been a game changer for his health. Having that covered, he says \"has been such a relief. It's just made me feel important and valid, like I deserve to exist or something like that.\" But without the subsidy, his premium for next year will go from $15 per month to $550, which is nearly half his monthly income. Without insurance to cover his medication, McKay says, \"I would be in an extremely bad situation of having difficulty maintaining my job, maintaining my house, maybe even having a life-threatening situation, if I were to have a mental health crisis.\" He says he is considering moving to California or Washington state, where state programs offer more secure coverage. \"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\" Catriona Johnson, Chapel Hill, N.C. Before the ACA, 44-year-old Catriona Johnson had to live without health insurance for several years because she had a pre-existing condition. She was born with a congenital abnormality that required multiple surgeries in her abdomen and still requires her to use a catheter every day. She says that the preventative care she got access to through ACA has increased her quality of health enough for her to earn her Master of Social Work degree. Currently, she pays $442 a month for her premium with the tax credit, but that is set to go up to $666 next year. Her deductible will jump by $1,000. Insurance is critical for her as she requires ongoing medical care. \"I have no idea what I am going to do if I cannot afford care. Just go day by day, keep trying,\" she says. Johnson says she's always tried to do things right. Despite her serious health problems, she went to college and grad school and has a job. Still, she lives paycheck to paycheck as a contract social worker in private practice, with most of her credit card bills being medical-related — medical supplies, medications, doctors' appointments.  She wonders, \"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\" She worries that the rise in costs for her health insurance will affect her credit, which already happened in her 20s because of medical debt. \"Everything I can't pay — on to the credit card, to worry about another day.\" To cover an extra $1,300 a month, he'll stop contributing to retirement Chris O'Donnell, Richmond, Va.  After he got laid off from his job this summer, Chris O'Donnell, 58, started a freelance business. He gets his health insurance through Virginia's ACA marketplace.  He and his wife currently pay $837 a month for their plan. Without subsidies, the 2026 cost will be $2155 — that's $1,300 more per month. O'Donnell says he plans to redirect the money he would have saved for retirement to cover the added premium costs. \"This is not the time to be zeroing out my retirement contributions, but what choice do I have?\" His wife has diabetes and is a cancer survivor, so \"not having insurance is just completely out of the question,\" he says. \"Even if I wanted to go without health insurance, just the supplies for her insulin pump would cost $25,000 a year anyway, so I wouldn't actually be saving anything.\" He and his wife are seriously considering retirement in a country where health care costs are more stable. \"If this is the new normal and then you figure, health insurance is going to go up 20% every year, then I don't know that long-term staying in this country is going to be sustainable for us,\" he says. With the cost more than doubling, she might forgo health insurance Celeste Jameson, North Port, Fla. For paralegal Celeste Jameson, 41, her monthly insurance premiums will more than double next year, from $266 to $593. \"I can't afford $593 a month. I just can't, on top of all of my other living expenses,\" Jameson  told WUSF. As a young adult, she suffered from severe abdominal and pelvic pain that went undiagnosed until just over 10 years ago, when she was finally able to get reliable health insurance through the ACA marketplace. \"I was in and out of hospitals with severe pain, ovarian contusions and everything, with no insurance,\" she said. The bills piled up. She got into medical debt. In 2014, after being rushed to the emergency room in \"probably the worst pain I'd ever had,\" a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body. Once she felt better, she was able to take on regular work as a paralegal. She credits her health insurance with finally helping her get the diagnosis that led to her improved health. She has not yet renewed her insurance for next year. \"It scares me to know or to even imagine that I could be back where I was before 2014,\" she said. \"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance.\" Kelly Badeau, Tucson, Ariz. Kelly Badeau is facing monthly insurance costs of nearly nine times what she is paying now. She currently pays $94 per month for a silver ACA plan after the tax credits, and her 2026 plan will cost an estimated $900. Before becoming self-employed 10years ago, she had \"bare bones\" insurance with a high deductible through an employer. Her current ACA silver plan \"is the best insurance I've ever had,\" she says. It has allowed her to take a proactive approach to her health, including annual primary care visits, screenings like mammograms and a colonoscopy, and seeing an audiologist. \"With the ACA, I'm healthier both mentally and physically,\" she says. She says she doesn't want to drop her current plan. \"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance,\" she says. She sold her home last year and says she'll have to use some of that money to pay for health care. \"I will dip into my savings to make my payments next year,\" she says. \"I don't want this administration to think they can tank the ACA by making us suffer.\" But Badeau worries that she might have to start cutting corners in her health if she has too many medical expenses and can't afford the co-pays. Her husband may need treatment for prostate cancer soon, and she's on hormone therapy for menopause and blood pressure drugs. \"I'm just trying to keep my head above water until I can get Medicare, but that's still many years from now,\" she says. She worries she'll become disabled without health care Genna Boatright, Siren, Wis. Genna Boatright, 40, has an aggressive case of rheumatoid arthritis and relies on medication to control it. She is currently only paying $12 a month for her insurance premium because the enhanced subsidy covers most of her cost. But she says without the tax credit, her new premium costs will be $700, based on the numbers she's seeing in the marketplace. \"And that I absolutely cannot afford,\" she says. She says her income changed this year, and when she went onto the marketplace to shop for plans, she was pushed to apply for Medicaid. But she was denied Medicaid coverage. So she's continuing to see what is possible and waiting to see if anything changes with the prices. \"The flood of overwhelm has been real,\" she says. She worries about how she will get coverage she can afford and is \"trying to make it through the days.\" \"I do worry that without insurance and specialty care and the medication that I'm on, how quickly I will become disabled,\" she says. \"And that's an absolutely terrifying prospect.\" As a self-employed therapist, her ACA plan is her only option for insurance Kristine Weidner, Branford, Conn. Self-employed as a psychotherapist, Kristine Weidner, 62, says the cost of the plan she buys on the ACA marketplace will nearly triple in 2026. Her current high-deductible plan costs $589 a month, not including dental, and a comparable plan for 2026 will cost $1691 a month. She's really worried about the cost and about meeting the deductible. \"If I include dental, it will cost more than my housing,\" she says. And she has \"no other option\" for health care. Going without insurance, she says, isn't a wise choice at her age. She's also worried the rising costs may impact volume in her business as some clients may forgo insurance and not be able to afford her services.  \"I may need to consider closing my business and returning to the public sector and employer-based insurance.\" NPR's Margaux Bauerlein and Selena Simmons-Duffin and WUSF's Kerry Sheridan contributed reporting. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98669","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:35:00-05:00","title":"Fire Prompts Evacuations at U.N.

PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Infant formula linked to a botulism outbreak that has sickened dozens of babies across 15 states may still be on store shelves even after being recalled, federal health officials say. As of Wednesday, the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said , 31 cases of suspected or confirmed infant botulism have been reported in babies who consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula and got sick between August and mid-November. No deaths have been reported. But all 31 babies were hospitalized with the illness, which can cause a potentially  life-threatening form of gradual paralysis  in infants less than a year old. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, which is causing infant illness in multiple regions of the country,\" the FDA said. ByHeart Whole Nutrition recalled two batches of its infant formula earlier this month before  expanding the recall  to all of its products — which include cans and single-serve packets — last week. They are sold at major retailers — including Target, Publix, Walmart and Whole Foods — and online nationwide, with some products shipped to customers outside the U.S. ByHeart, which describes itself as a \"next-generation baby nutrition company,\" first hit the market in 2022. The FDA says its products make up \"approximately 1%\" of all infant formula sold in the U.S., so it does not have concerns about a  potential shortage . In an  apology note  to parents, ByHeart says it is cooperating with the FDA and \"investigating every facet of our process\" to identify the cause of the outbreak. In the meantime, the company — along with the FDA — is urging adults to stop using the formula and monitor their babies for symptoms of botulism. The FDA is also asking stores to stop selling the product. But in its Wednesday update, the agency said it had \"received reports that recalled formula is still being found on store shelves in multiple states.\" NPR has reached out to the FDA for more information but did not hear back by publication time. The FDA says it is working with state partners and retailers \"to ensure an effective recall\" as its investigation into the outbreak continues. What we know about the outbreak As of Wednesday, the  FDA said  the 31 cases had been reported in 15 states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington. The outbreak has grown since the FDA first announced its investigation on Nov. 8. At that point, it said that out of an estimated 83 cases of infant botulism reported nationwide since August, 13 of the infants had consumed ByHeart formula at some point. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That raised red flags, because botulism is uncommon in dairy products and \"there is no historical precedent of infant formula causing infant botulism,\" the FDA said. In response, ByHeart promptly recalled two batches of its products. The next day,  it announced  that the California Department of Public Health had tested a sample from one of those batches, and the result came back positive for Clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that causes infant botulism. That sample came from an opened can, which ByHeart originally said did not prove that its product was to blame (as the bacteria can occur naturally in places like soil and dust). But in an  FAQ on its website , it now says further testing by a third-party group identified the bacteria in some samples of unopened formula, too. ByHeart says  the FDA informed it in a \"late-night call\" on Nov. 10 that it had found two more cases of infant botulism in babies that had consumed its formula. The next day, ByHeart, citing \"too many unanswered questions,\" recalled all of its products and released information for parents about  how to switch  to a different formula brand. What to know about infant botulism  Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum. When a baby swallows the spores, \"they grow in the gut and make toxin,\" according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). Symptoms can appear three to 30 days after consuming the bacteria, and generally start with constipation, poor feeding, difficulty swallowing and loss of head control. \"If untreated, infants with infant botulism experience a progressive, flaccid paralysis that can lead to breathing difficulties and require weeks of hospitalization,\" the CDC says. Treatment for infant botulism involves an antitoxin known as BabyBIG, which is administered through an IV. The CDC says parents should stay vigilant for several weeks after their baby last consumed ByHeart formula. They are advised to wash contaminated surfaces and label any leftover powder \"DO NOT USE\" and store it safely for a month, in case their infant develops symptoms and the state health department wants to test it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The CDC says parents should seek immediate medical care if they see any concerning symptoms, and also directs them to an infant  botulism outbreak hotline  from the California Department of Public Health set up specifically to respond to this outbreak. What the company is doing  ByHeart says it is conducting its own \"extensive testing\" and giving the FDA \"complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation.\" The company has released  more resources  for customers in the days since the recall, like a 24/7 support hotline and refunds for purchases since October. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It has  also pledged  to implement stronger safeguards and testing in the future, saying that Clostridium botulinum was \"not among the pathogens routinely tested for across the industry\" — until now. In the meantime, several affected family members have taken legal action. The parents of two four-month-olds who were hospitalized with infant botulism — in Arizona and Kentucky — filed  separate  federal  lawsuits  last week. They accused ByHeart of negligence and are seeking compensation for medical bills and emotional distress after both their daughters required hospitalization. A separate  class-action suit  filed in New York alleges deceptive marketing. ByHeart told NPR over email that it cannot comment on litigation, but reiterated its commitment to supporting families and the FDA's investigation. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/national-guard-dc-deployment-c1c2b13a7102632632267bf1262506ff","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:15:34+00:00","title":"Federal Judge Orders Trump Administration to End National Guard Deployment in Washington, D.C.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, ruled that President Donald Trump’s unilateral deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., violated the District’s sovereign authority to manage local law enforcement, finding that the president could not deploy troops without the mayor’s consent.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb concluded that President Donald Trump’s military takeover in Washington, D.C., illegally intrudes on local officials’ authority to direct law enforcement in the district. She put her order on hold for 21 days to allow for an appeal, however. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to challenge the Guard deployments. He asked the judge to bar the White House from deploying Guard troops without the mayor’s consent while the lawsuit plays out. Dozens of states took sides in Schwalb’s lawsuit, with their support falling along party lines. Cobb found that while the president does have authority to protect federal functioning and property, he can’t unilaterally deploy the D.C. National Guard to help with crime control as he sees fit or call in troops from other states. After her ruling, Schwalb called for troops to be sent home. “Normalizing the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent, where the President can disregard states’ independence and deploy troops wherever and whenever he wants — with no check on his military power,” Schwalb said.

Within a month, more than 2,300 National Guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling the city under the command of the Secretary of the Army. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist in patrols. The administration has also deployed Guard troops to Los Angeles and tried to send troops into Chicago and Portland, Oregon, prompting other court challenges. A federal appeals court allowed the Los Angeles deployment, and the administration is appealing a judge’s decision in Portland that found the president did not have the authority to call up or deploy National Guard troops there. The Supreme Court is weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area in support of an immigration crackdown. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment. In Washington, It’s unclear how long the deployments will last, but attorneys from Schwalb’s office said Guard troops are likely to remain in the city through at least next summer. “Our constitutional democracy will never be the same if these occupations are permitted to stand,” they wrote . Government lawyers have said Congress empowered the president to control the D.C. National Guard’s operation. “There is no sensible reason for an injunction unwinding this arrangement now, particularly since the District’s claims have no merit,” Justice Department attorneys wrote . The Trump administration has deputized the Guard troops in Washington to serve as special U.S. Marshal Service deputies. Schwalb’s office said out-of-state troops are impermissibly operating as a federal military police force in D.C., inflaming tensions with residents and diverting local police resources. “Every day that this lawless incursion continues, the District suffers harm to its sovereign authority to conduct local law enforcement as it chooses,” his office’s attorneys wrote."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"Public Outcry Over New Immigration Policy Sparks Human Rights Debate in 2024","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 10, 2024, the government announced a new immigration policy that has sparked intense public debate.

The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement. Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar. Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years. More coverage Migrants thought they were in court for a routine hearing. Instead, it was a deportation trap Multicultural New Orleans awaits arrival of ‘Swamp Sweep’ immigration crackdown Judge tosses DOJ lawsuit challenging a New York law barring immigration agents from state courts The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration , private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection , into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars. This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports. The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels. The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border. And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.

While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University. Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety. “They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.” ‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’ A license plate reader stands along the side of a road, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, in Stockdale, Texas.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country. Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop. But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people. Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist. Image recognition analysis overlaid on drivers and vehicles on Texas roads. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped. Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer. “We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound. Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP. In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.

They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting. At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing. “The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.

Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages. Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials. The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared. In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route. Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.

He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.” After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP. The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment. The case is pending in federal court in Texas.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt. Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states. But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region. In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said. Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning. The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.

In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio. Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety. Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment. Also from AP’s investigation into the use of surveillance technology: U.S. tech firms to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state , playing a far greater role in enabling rights abuses than known before. Across five Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. government has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police . Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used. Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests. CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county. One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.

CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.

Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million. In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security. “If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said. In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment. Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.

One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns. In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino , for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.

Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego. In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters. Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.

They don’t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,” Schott said. “I think there’s thousands of people getting treated this way.” Dotted Line with Center Square —- Tau reported from Washington, Laredo, San Antonio, Kingsville and Victoria, Texas.

Elissa Slotkin’s X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.” “The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution,” Slotkin wrote in the X post. Along with the Michigan senator, the other lawmakers appearing in the video are seen as possible future aspirants for higher office, who now, thanks to the video’s wide exposure, have elevated their own political profiles. Trump on Thursday reposted messages from others about the video, amplifying it with his own words. It marked another flashpoint in the political rhetoric that at times has been thematic in his administrations, as well as among some in his MAGA base. Some Democrats accused him of acting like a king and trying to distract from the soon-to-be-released files about disgraced financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein. What Democrats said in the video With pieces of dialogue spliced together from different members, the lawmakers introduce themselves and their background. They go on to say the Trump administration “is pitting our uniformed military against American citizens.” They call for service members to “refuse illegal orders” and “stand up for our laws.” The lawmakers conclude the video by encouraging service members, “Don’t give up the ship,” a War of 1812-era phrase attributed to a U.S. Navy captain’s dying command to his crew. Although the lawmakers didn’t mention specific circumstances in the video, its release comes as the Trump administration continues attempts at deployment of National Guard troops into U.S. cities for various roles, although some have been pulled back, and others held up in court. Are U.S. troops allowed to disobey orders? Troops, especially uniformed commanders, have a specific obligation to reject an order that’s unlawful, if they make that determination. However, while commanders have military lawyers on their staffs to consult with in helping make such a determination, rank-and-file troops who are tasked with carrying out those orders are rarely in a similar position. Broad legal precedence holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, doesn’t absolve troops. However, the U.S. military legal code, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice or UCMJ, will punish troops for failing to follow an order should it turn out to be lawful. Troops can be criminally charged with Article 90 of the UCMJ, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, and Article 92, failure to obey an order.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More How Trump and others responded On Thursday, Trump reposted to social media an article about the video, adding his own commentary that it was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country.” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” Trump went on. “LOCK THEM UP???” He called for the lawmakers’ arrest and trial, adding in a separate post that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” Trump also reposted more than a dozen comments from other accounts criticizing Democrats, including one that stated: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!” Asked during a White House briefing on Thursday about the intent of Trump’s messages, press secretary Karoline Leavitt instead honed in on the Democrats’ message, which she posited “perhaps is punishable by law.” Leavitt went on to say that any incitement to “defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders” is “a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do, and they should be held accountable, and that’s what the president wants to see.” The White House insisted Thursday that President Donald Trump was not calling for Democratic lawmakers to be executed for a video urging troops to defy “illegal orders,” despite his post calling their comments “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” Democrats were swift to react to Trump’s words, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warning in a floor speech that the president was “lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.” Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not believe Trump was calling for violence in the social media posts, saying Trump was merely “defining a crime,” and calling the Democrats’ video “wildly inappropriate.” “Think of the threat that is to our national security and what it means for our institution,” Johnson added. Trump’s allies balked at the video. On Wednesday on Fox News, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called the messaging “insurrection — plainly, directly, without question” and said it represented “a general call for rebellion from the CIA and the armed services of the United States, by Democrat lawmakers.” On X, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth commented on the video Tuesday as “Stage 4 TDS,” referring to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a term used by Trump to describe voters so angry and opposed to him that they are incapable of seeing any good in what he does. The Steady State, which describes itself as “a network of 300+ national and homeland security experts standing for strong and principled policy, rule of law, and democracy,” wrote in a Substack post on Thursday that the lawmakers’ call was “only a restatement of what every officer and enlisted servicemember already knows: illegal orders can and should be refused. This is not a political opinion. It is doctrine.” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell challenged the theory that illegal orders were being issued. “Our military follows orders, and our civilians give legal orders,” Parnell told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We love the Constitution.

birthplace of jazz, where lavish parades, bead-throwing debauchery and Creole cuisine attract tourists from around the globe, is about to become the next staging ground for the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. Operation “Swamp Sweep,” an expansive, monthslong immigration crackdown, is expected to launch in southeast Louisiana Dec. 1, but Democrat-run New Orleans is anticipating the arrival of as many as 250 federal troops as soon as Friday, all with the backing of the state’s Republican governor. Gov. Jeff Landry has sought to align New Orleans with federal immigration enforcement efforts through legislation and legal challenges, and the Border Patrol deployment is just the latest drive to ramp up that pressure. And with the New Orleans Police Department being released from a federal reform pact Wednesday, its officers have lost a legal mechanism that has long-shielded them from having to participate in immigration enforcement. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security operation will be led by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has already overseen aggressive campaigns in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on A gung-ho Republican governor Landry, who has close ties to the nation’s top immigration officials, has made immigration enforcement a priority. Louisiana does not share a border with another country, yet it has become one of the nation’s largest detention hubs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with a capacity upward of 6,000 detainees. In September, the Bayou State opened the “Louisiana Lockup” inside a notorious state prison to hold immigrants whom federal officials consider dangerous. The governor has also highlighted crimes in which the suspect’s immigration status is in question, such as the killing of a French Quarter tour guide by a group that included a Honduran man who entered the country illegally. New Orleans’ deep-rooted immigrant communities New Orleans’ Democratic leaders frequently butt heads with Landry and other state officials who accuse the city of lax law enforcement and have pushed for collaboration with the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Mayor-elect Helena Moreno , a Mexican-American immigrant, told The Associated Press there is “a lot of fear” in her city and that she is working to ensure those who could be targeted by federal agents know their rights. “I’m very concerned about due process being violated, I’m very concerned about racial profiling,” Moreno said. New Orleans is known for its rich blend of French, Spanish, African and Native American cultures. It is home to more than 10,000 ethnic Vietnamese who arrived after the Vietnam War. A city monument recognizes the thousands of Latino workers who helped rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina . South Louisiana’s distinctive Cajun heritage emerged from French-speaking colonists exiled there in the 18th century. In September, Landry requested a National Guard deployment to New Orleans, citing rising violent crime, even though city police say crime is down and its elected leaders say federal troops are unnecessary. Landry told Newsmax on Wednesday that the “Swamp Sweep” operation is focused on “taking dangerous criminals off the street.” A Landry spokesperson declined to comment to the AP on Border Patrol operations. Rachel Taber, an organizer with the New Orleans-based advocacy group Union Migrante, said the influx of federal agents would have far-reaching negative impacts. “The same people pushing for this attack on immigrants benefit from immigrant labor and the exploitation of immigrants,” Taber said. “Who do they think is going to clean the hotels from Mardi Gras or clean up after their fancy Mardi Gras parade?” Conflict over the city’s immigration policies In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell saying the city “engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement.” The city has been barred from receiving certain federal law enforcement grants, according to Jim Craft, executive director of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement, which distributes federal funds. Cantrell did not respond to a request for comment. Under Landry, the GOP-dominated Louisiana Legislature has targeted New Orleans’ immigration policies, including by passing a law threatening jail time for law enforcement officials who delay or ignore federal enforcement efforts. Another measure directs state agencies to verify, track and report anyone illegally in the U.S. who is receiving state services, and one more bans city policies that prohibit cooperation with federal immigration agencies. “Their enforcement of laws is indiscriminate at best, corrupt at worst,” said Republican state Sen. Jay Morris, who was behind the law punishing obstruction of immigration enforcement. “Apparently we have to have a law to tell people not to break the law.” Federal oversight of local law enforcement The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s office and the New Orleans Police Department have been subject to longstanding federal oversight that barred them from engaging in immigration enforcement. The police oversight ended Wednesday, leaving officers in an uncertain legal position if they receive conflicting directives from city and state leaders, according to the city’s Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment. Moreno, set to take office as mayor on Jan. 12, said the city’s police will follow state law, but that department policy viewed immigration enforcement as a civil matter outside its jurisdiction. New Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick said department policies barring immigration enforcement “are not in conflict” with state laws. Kirkpatrick said she met with ICE officials this week and her department will work with federal agents to ensure public safety. “Our support is to make sure they are not going to get hurt and that our community is not in danger,” she said. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, backed by the Department of Justice, has requested an end to federal oversight of the sheriff’s office, saying it impedes the state’s ability to enforce immigration law.

A number of controllers started calling out of work as the shutdown dragged on longer than a month and they dealt with the financial pressure of working without a paycheck. Some of them got side jobs, but others simply couldn’t afford the child care or gas they needed to work. Their absences forced delays at airports across the country and led the government to order airlines to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports. President Donald Trump suggested the bonuses for those who have stayed on the job in a social media post, but he also suggested that controllers who missed work should have their pay docked. FAA officials haven’t publicly announced plans to penalize controllers. Thousands of FAA technicians also had to work during the shutdown to maintain the equipment that air traffic controllers rely on. At least 6,600 technicians were expected to work throughout the shutdown but more than 3,000 others were subject to be recalled to work.

In a post on X he described it as “Santa’s coming to town a little early.” Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on “These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,” Duffy said in his formal announcement. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association union said only 311 of its more than 10,000 members will receive the bonuses. The union said these workers with perfect attendance deserve recognition but so do the others. “We are concerned that thousands of air traffic controllers who consistently reported for duty during the shutdown, ensuring the safe transport of passengers and cargo across the nation, while working without pay and uncertain of when they would receive compensation, were excluded from this recognition. More than 311 of these dedicated professionals were instrumental in keeping America moving,” the union said in a statement. The Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union said the thousands of technicians it represents worked hard to keep the aging computer and radar systems controllers use operating during the shutdown, and they should all be recognized — not just the 423 getting bonuses. “It took many hands to ensure that not one delay during the historic 43-day shutdown was attributed to equipment or system failures,” the union said in a statement. Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen questioned why all the controllers and others who worked to keep flights moving during during the shutdown won’t get bonuses. “For the Trump administration to not give a bonus to every single one of these hardworking women and men is wrong; they all deserve a bonus and back pay,” said Larsen, who is the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee. The controllers union said they hope to work with Duffy to find a way to recognize all the other air traffic controllers who worked during the shutdown. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that any TSA officers who went “above and beyond” while working without pay would get $10,000 bonuses, but she never specified how many will qualify beyond the handful of checks she handed out to officers at a news conference. The FAA was already critically short on air traffic controllers before the shutdown. Duffy had been working to boost controller hiring and streamline the years of training required in the hope of eliminating the shortage over the next several years. Duffy has said that some students and controllers quit and more experienced controllers retired during the shutdown. Many controllers already work 10-hour shifts six days a week because the FAA is so short on staffing. As more controllers missed work, the FAA ordered airlines to cut flights to relieve pressure on the system. Duffy said repeatedly that FAA safety experts became worried as the absences grew because of reports from pilots concerned about controllers’ responses and a number of runway incursions . Since the shutdown ended, controller staffing has improved significantly and airlines were allowed to resume normal operations this week."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/florida-execution-richard-barry-randolph-84cf20dc6eab1eeccba87eadec81e3a8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:01:25+00:00","title":"Florida Executes Man Convicted of 1988 Rape and Murder of Convenience Store Manager","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Richard Barry Randolph, 63, was executed on November 20, 2025, in Starke, Florida, marking the state’s 17th execution of the year.

(AP) — A man convicted of raping and fatal beating his manager at a Florida convenience store in 1988 was put to death Thursday evening in the state’s record 17th execution this year. Richard Barry Randolph , 63, was pronounced dead at 6:12 p.m. following a three-drug injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. Randolph was convicted of murder, armed robbery, sexual battery and grand theft and sentenced to death in 1989 for the killing of Minnie Ruth McCollum. The curtain to the death chamber went up exactly at 6:00 p.m., the scheduled execution time, and authorities began administering the drugs two minutes later after Randolph had no last words. As the drugs flowed, Randolph’s eyes were closed and his face twitched slightly. He breathed heavily for a few minutes before going still, the color drained from his face. A warden shook Randolph and yelled his name, but there was no reaction and no movement. A medic was called in at 6:11 p.m. and Randolph was subsequently pronounced dead. Jordan Kirkland, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said at a news briefing afterward that the family of the victim had asked him to thank Gov. Ron DeSantis on their behalf. Kirkland said earlier that three members of the victim’s family had planned to be witnesses but he didn’t elaborate.

DeSantis said recently that his goal is to bring justice to victims’ families who have waited decades for the death sentences to be carried out. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on According to court records, Randolph attempted in August 1988 to break into the safe at a convenience store in Palatka, where he had previously worked. Randolph was spotted by the manager, McCollum, and the two began to struggle. Randolph then beat, strangled, stabbed and raped McCollum before leaving the store and taking the woman’s car, the records show. Three women witnessed Randolph leaving the store and called the sheriff’s office after seeing through the window that the store was in disarray. A deputy responded and found McCollum still alive. Taken to a hospital in a coma, she died six days later of severe brain injuries, according to doctors. Randolph was arrested shortly afterward at a Jacksonville grocery store while trying to borrow money and also cash in lottery tickets stolen from the convenience store, according to deputies. Investigators said Randolph admitted to the attack and directed them to bloody clothing he had discarded. The Florida Supreme Court denied Randolph’s appeals last week. He had argued that a lower court had abused its discretion in denying him access to public records and that his own lawyers had acted without his consent. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Randolph’s final appeal Thursday morning. Including Randolph, a total of 44 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S., and more than a dozen other people are scheduled to be put to death during the rest of 2025 and next year. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, trailed by Alabama, South Carolina and Texas with five each. Two more executions are planned next month in Florida under death warrants signed by DeSantis. Mark Allen Geralds , 58, is scheduled for Florida’s 18th execution on Dec. 9. He was convicted of fatally stabbing a woman during home invasion robbery. Frank Athen Walls , 58, is set for Florida’s 19th execution on Dec. 18. He was convicted of fatally shooting a man and woman during home invasion robbery, and he later confessed to three other killings. Florida’s lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections. ___ Follow David Fischer on the social platform Bluesky: ‪@dwfischer.bsky.social‬"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/brazils-lula-faces-obstacles-in-push-for-agreement-at-climate-summit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:37:05+00:00","title":"Brazil’s Lula faces obstacles in push for agreement at climate summit","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is pushing for global unity and a shared, actionable roadmap to combat climate change, particularly in response to the absence of the United States.

at climate summit\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has pushed for a show of unity at the  COP30 summit , where the absence of the United States has underscored the need for greater cooperation to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nLula and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with key figures at the  climate summit  in Belem, Brazil, on Wednesday, seeking a deal that would bridge contentious issues.\n\n“We need to show society that we want this without imposing anything on anyone, without setting deadlines for each country to decide what it can do within its own time, within its own possibilities,”  Lula  told reporters, saying countries must find a shared “roadmap” on climate action.\n\nBut the Brazilian leader, who has positioned himself as a chief advocate of both climate action and greater collaboration between non-Western countries, has struggled to bridge divides on issues such as fossil fuel use and climate finance.\n\nScientists have warned that a failure to quickly transition away from the use of fossil fuels could bring disastrous changes to the planet’s ecosystem and result in dangerous increases in extreme weather across the globe with poor countries  more vulnerable  to severe impacts.\n\n“A road map is not a workshop or a ministerial meeting. A road map is a real workplan that needs to show us the way from where we are to where we need to be, and how to get there,” a letter from seven prominent scientists, including some who are advising the COP30 presidency, stated.\n\nWhile the US decision not to attend the climate summit has loomed large, other influential countries have also been hesitant to commit to ambitious goals.\n\nSome countries, such as  India , have criticised the lack of action by rich countries, which are responsible for a large majority of cumulative emissions and have been the subject of calls by poor countries to lower barriers to advancements in renewable technology.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a distant manifestation but is real and imminent,” Indian Environmental Minister Bhupender Yadav said in remarks to the conference on Monday.

The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man. The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It’s routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver’s seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women. The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs.

2025-11-11T14:15:46+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/cair-sues-texas-governor-over-unconstitutional-terror-designation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:56:43+00:00","title":"CAIR sues Texas governor over ‘unconstitutional’ terror designation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim civil rights organization in the United States, has filed a federal lawsuit against Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, challenging their designation of CAIR’s Texas chapter as a 'foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organisation'.

CAIR’s Texas chapter a “foreign terrorist organisation”.\n\nThe lawsuit, which also targets Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, seeks to block Abbott’s designation of the group as a “terrorist

2025-11-20T17:07:22+00:00\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time to be looking for a job . Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon , are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands . And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many to work without paychecks . The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released Thursday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. There’s also growing gender and racial disparities. The National Women’s Law Center notes women only accounted for 21,000 of September’s added jobs — and that Black women over the age of 20, in particular, saw unemployment climb to 7.5% for the month.

The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: Verizon In November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees . In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors General Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles . Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. Paramount In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance , Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon Amazon said last month that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs , close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. UPS United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target Target in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions , or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. Nestlé In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs . The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. Lufthansa Group In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence , digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Novo Nordisk Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs , about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. ConocoPhillips Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce , as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers , excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction . Microsoft In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. Procter & Gamble In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/at-least-three-killed-as-magnitude-5-5-earthquake-hits-bangladesh","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:56:09+00:00","title":"At least five killed as magnitude 5.5 earthquake hits Bangladesh","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful magnitude 5.5 earthquake struck near Narsingdi, Bangladesh, at 10:38am on November 21, 2025, with the epicenter in the Madhabdi district.

— World stocks on Friday tracked Wall Street’s sharp drop in skittish trading, with major benchmarks erasing the previous day’s gains. Worries persist about a bubble in artificial intelligence -related shares. Better than expected U.S. jobs data also have raised the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will hold off on an interest rate cut in December, disappointing investors who have been counting on rate cuts to fuel more gains. The future for the S&P 500 was up 0.2% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.3% higher. In early European trading, Germany’s DAX declined 0.9% to 23,063.05, while Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.5% to 9,484.29. In Paris, the CAC 40 shed 0.6% to 7,935.43. Other big recent winners also lost ground. Bitcoin dropped 4.5% to $82,500, down from nearly $125,000 last month. In Asian trading, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.4% to 48,625.88 as the government approved a 21.3 trillion yen ($135 billion) stimulus package that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi promised as part of efforts to revive the sluggish economy. However, the plans for higher government spending that would delay progress toward trimming down the national debt have put the yen and Japanese government bonds under pressure. The yield on the 30-year government bond has been touching record levels on heavy selling, hitting 3.37% on Friday.

Japan reported Friday that its exports to the rest of the world rose in October, while those to the U.S. fell. Higher shipments to elsewhere in Asia helped offset the drop in exports to the U.S due to President Donald Trump’s higher tariffs. In the stock market, selling of tech shares dominated, with computer chip test equipment maker Advantest sinking 12.1%, while chip maker Tokyo Electron lost 7.1%. South Korea’s KOSPI tumbled 3.8% to 3,853.26, reversing Thursday’s gains. Samsung Electronics sank 5.8%, while SK Hynix plunged 8.8%. In Chinese markets, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index skidded 2.4 % to 25,220.02 while the Shanghai Composite index slid nearly 2.5% to 3,834.89, with pressure also coming from escalating friction between China and Japan over Taiwan. Taiwan’s Taiex shed 3.6%, with market heavyweight TSMC, the world’s biggest contract maker of semiconductors, falling 4.8%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.6% to 8,416.50. while India’s BSE Sensex declined 0.5%. “What began as a textbook “Nvidia bounce” flipped into one of the most violent intraday reversals since the April dump, and Asia — ever the obedient understudy — marched directly into the same plunge tank on the open,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. On Thursday, jarring swings rocked Wall Street, and U.S. stocks erased a big morning gain to drop as the market remains skittish following weeks of doubts and erratic moves. The S&P 500 erased early gains to fall 1.6% to 6,538.76, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% to 45,752.26. The Nasdaq composite sank 2.2% to 22,078.05. Nvidia initially appeared to tamp down the worries about a bubble for AI stocks after reporting a big profit for the summer, along with a forecast for coming revenue that easily cleared analysts’ expectations. By delivering strong profits and indicating more are coming, Nvidia can justify its stock’s price gains and make it look less expensive. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil slid $1.17 to $57.82 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.11 to $62.27 per barrel.

fossil fuels as the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, is slated to end in Brazil’s northern city of Belem, potentially in a haze of recriminations.\n\nDelegates at the two-week conference have failed to reach a deal as Brazil circulated a new draft proposal on Thursday that did not include a roadmap to transitioning away from fossil fuels – nor mention the term “fossil fuels” at all.\n\nMore than 30 other countries from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Pacific co-signed a letter in response, slamming the draft and saying they “cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly and equitable transition” from nonrenewable energy sources.\n\nThe commitment to moving away from fossil fuels – including natural gas, coal and crude oil –  was considered a landmark achievement of COP28 in Dubai . Even then, the deal stopped short of calling for a “phase-out” amid fierce lobbying from oil-producing countries.\n\nA first draft of the COP30 text, which was publicised on Tuesday, did contain the option of building a roadmap away from such fuels.\n\nBut major producers and consumers, including China, India, Saudi Arabia and Russia, rejected the proposal, several news outlets reported, quoting negotiators familiar with discussions.\n\nThe United States – which backed a phase-out in 2023 under former President Joe Biden – did not send a delegation to this year’s conference.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has long slammed the climate crisis and global warming as a “hoax.”\n\nAnother point of contention is climate finance, meaning money to help countries adapt to climate change. Brazil’s newest draft calls for tripling climate financing by 2030 compared with 2025 levels.\n\nBut it left unclear who exactly would provide the financing, whether it be wealthy states, the private sector or multilateral development banks. Western countries have historically baulked at providing cash to poorer nations dealing with the worst climate change effects.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the conference was “down to the wire” and urged countries to “address disinformation aimed at derailing the transition”.\n\n“Communities on the front lines are watching too, counting flooded homes, failed harvests, lost livelihoods,” he added. “They have heard enough excuses.”\n\nThe languishing negotiations were meanwhile interrupted on Thursday by a fire that forced thousands of delegates to evacuate the conference.\n\nFlames erupted  in an exhibition pavilion and rapidly spread up the building’s internal shell as attendees finished lunch, lasting about six minutes.\n\nNineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation, but no injuries were reported, according to event and fire officials.\n\nDelegates have reported various problems with electrical wiring, air conditioning and infrastructure throughout COP30, which is taking place at the edge of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThousands of protesters have also  marched in Belem  to call for Indigenous people and environmental defenders to be heard.\n\nIn a joint statement on Thursday evening, the UN and COP30 leaders said the fire site was “safe” and shifted the focus back to the negotiations, which may spill into the weekend.\n\n“We still have substantial work ahead, and we trust that delegates will return to the negotiations in a spirit of solidarity and determination to ensure a successful outcome for this COP,” the statement said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1366","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"00:26:06+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,366","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of November 21, 2025, the Russia-Ukraine war has reached its 1,366th day, marking over three years of sustained conflict since Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022.

breaking record for female artists\n\nA haunting 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo has sold for $54.7m, making it the most expensive work by a female artist to sell at auction.\n\nThe painting of Kahlo asleep in a bed, titled El sueno (La cama) – or in English, The Dream (The Bed) – surpassed the record held by Georgia O’Keeffe’s Jimson Weed/White Flower No 1, which sold for $44.4m in 2014.\n\nThe sale at Sotheby’s in New York on Thursday evening also topped Kahlo’s own auction record for a work by a Latin American artist.\n\nThe 1949 painting, Diego and I, depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, went for $34.9m in 2021.\n\nHer paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.\n\nThe self-portrait that broke records on Thursday is among the few Kahlo pieces that have remained in private hands outside Mexico, where her body of work has been declared an artistic monument.\n\nKahlo’s works in both public and private collections within Mexico cannot be sold abroad or destroyed. Because the painting sold on Thursday comes from a private collection, it is legally eligible for international sale.

She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.\n\nKahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was altered by a bus accident at 18.\n\nShe started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, and then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.\n\nDuring the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view painting as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.\n\n“I’m very proud that she’s one of the most valued women, because really, what woman doesn’t identify with Frida, or what person doesn’t?” her great-niece, Mara Romeo Kahlo, told The Associated Press news agency before the auction.\n\n“I think everyone carries a little piece of my aunt in their heart.”\n\nKahlo resisted being labelled a surrealist painter, a style of art that is dreamlike and centres on a fascination with the unconscious mind.\n\n“I never painted dreams,” she once said. “I painted my own reality.”\n\nThe new record for Kahlo’s painting came hours after a  Gustav Klimt portrait sold  for $236.4m, setting a new record for a modern art piece.\n\nKlimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sold after a 20-minute bidding war, also at Sotheby’s in New York, on Tuesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/fugees-rapper-sentenced-to-14-years-in-prison-over-illegal-obama-donations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"03:55:42+00:00","title":"Fugees rapper sentenced to 14 years in prison over illegal Obama donations","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prakazrel Michel, a Grammy-winning member of the 1990s hip-hop group the Fugees, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for illegally funneling over $120 million in foreign donations from fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low into Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.

2025-11-20T05:08:16+00:00\n\nTitle: India wants COP30 to focus on climate adaptation, but dries up own fund\n\nIndian-administered Kashmir  – On the night of September 2, Shabir Ahmad’s home was swallowed by mud and swept into the river after relentless rains triggered a landslide in Sarh village in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Reasi district.\n\n“I had been building my house brick by brick since 2016. It was my life’s work. Only less than a year ago, I had finished constructing the second floor, and now there is nothing,” the 36-year-old father of three children told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmad’s was among nearly 20 houses in Sarh lost to the Chenab River that night, including one belonging to his brother, as dozens of families helplessly watched their farmlands, shops and other properties worth millions of rupees vanish without a trace.\n\n“We don’t even have one inch of land left to stand on,” said Ahmad from a government school in Sarh, where his family and other villagers were sheltering after the deluge.\n\nThe tragedy at Sarh was among the latest of increasingly frequent climate disasters across India that destroy lives and livelihoods, and displace millions of people to an uncertain future.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), climate-related disasters forced more than 32 million people from their homes in India between 2015 and 2024, with 5.4 million displacements recorded in 2024 alone – the highest in 12 years. This makes India one of the three nations most affected by  internal displacements  due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.\n\nMoreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.\n\nTo help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.\n\nManaged by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of  vulnerable households .\n\nDuring a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.\n\n“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.\n\nIn another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.\n\n“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.\n\nBut the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.\n\nGovernment records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.\n\nSince the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.\n\nAs a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.\n\n“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.\n\nAn official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.\n\n“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.\n\nIn the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.\n\n“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.\n\nThis year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.\n\nIn Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBehera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIn West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.\n\nIn the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.\n\n“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.\n\nIn the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.\n\nThakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.\n\nYet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.\n\nA government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.\n\n“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”\n\nActivist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.\n\n“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.\n\n“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”\n\nClimate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.\n\n“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.\n\nBhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.\n\n“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.\n\n“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”\n\nBhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.\n\n“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.\n\nBack at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.\n\n“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.\n\n“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/how-trumps-absence-marks-leadership-opportunity-for-china-at-g20","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:46:49Z","title":"How Trump’s absence marks leadership opportunity for China at G20","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The absence of US President Donald Trump from the G20 summit in South Africa creates a strategic opening for China to expand its global influence, particularly in Africa.

2025-11-21T06:46:49+00:00\n\nTitle: How Trump’s absence marks leadership opportunity for China at G20\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s decision to  snub the G20 summit  in South Africa this year has handed an opportunity to China, as it seeks to expand its growing influence in the African continent and position itself as an alternative to the dangers of a unilateralist United States.\n\nWashington said it would not attend the two-day summit set to kick off on Saturday over widely discredited claims that the host country, previously ruled by its white minority under an apartheid system until 1994, now  mistreats white people .\n\nSouth Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa  hit back at Trump ’s claim that hosting the summit in Johannesburg was a “total disgrace”. “Boycott politics doesn’t work,” Ramaphosa said, adding that the US was “giving up the very important role that they should be playing as the biggest economy in the world”.\n\nBy Friday morning, Trump appeared to have backtracked on his stance somewhat, when speculation that Washington might send a US official to Johannesburg after all circulated.\n\nRegardless, the spat comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping sends Premier Li Qiang to represent him on the world stage. China’s 72-year-old president has dialled back foreign visits, increasingly delegating his top emissary.\n\n“The US is giving China an opportunity to expand its global influence,” Zhiqun Zhu, professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University, told Al Jazeera. “With the absence of the US, China and EU countries will be the focus of the summit and other countries will look for leadership [from them].”\n\nBut observers say that while Trump’s absence will direct heightened attention to Beijing’s statements and behaviour, it does not spell the end of the US-led order altogether.\n\nJing Gu, a political economist at the United Kingdom-based Institute of Development Studies, said the US’s failure to attend “does not automatically make China the new leader, but it creates visible space for China to present itself as a more stable, reliable partner in governance”.\n\n“It reinforces the perception that the US is stepping back from multilateralism and the shared management of global problems,” she said. “In that context, China can present itself as a more predictable, stable actor and emphasise continuity, support for open trade and engagement with the Global South.”\n\nThis year’s G20 will, for the first time, have an African chair and take place on the African continent. The African Union (AU) will also participate fully as a member.\n\nSouth Africa, which holds the G20 presidency, is expected to push for consensus and action on priority issues for African countries, including debt relief, economic growth, climate change and transition to clean energy.\n\nZhu, who also serves as editor-in-chief of the academic journal, China and the World, said South Africa’s themes were a “natural fit” for China, Africa’s largest trading partner.\n\n“China aims to become a leader in green energy, and there’s a lot of room for China and African countries to work on that,” he said.\n\nThe African continent, with its mineral wealth, booming population and fast-growing economies, offers huge potential for Chinese firms. Li, China’s premier, travelled to Zambia this week, marking the first visit to the country by a Chinese premier in 28 years. The copper-rich nation has Beijing as its largest official creditor for $5.7bn.\n\nEager to secure access to Zambia’s commodities and expand its exports from resource-rich East Africa, China signed a $1.4bn deal in September to rehabilitate the Tazara Railway, built in the 1970s and connecting Tanzania and Zambia, to improve rail-sea transportation in the region.\n\n“The Chinese economy and African economy are complementary; they both benefit from trade,” Zhu said. The G20 “is a great platform for China to project its global influence and seek opportunities to work with other countries”, he added.\n\nAfrica’s growing demand for energy and China’s dominance in manufacturing make the two a good fit, observers say. This is playing out. A report by energy think tank Ember, for instance, found Africa’s imports of solar panels from China rose a whopping 60 percent in the 12 months to June 2025.\n\nAccording to Gu at the Institute of Development Studies, China will be looking to tap into this growing synergy with Africa and will deliver a three-fold message at this year’s G20.\n\n“First, it will stress stability and the importance of global rules and regulations,” she said. Second, “it will link the G20 to the Global South and highlight issues like development and green transformation”.\n\nThird, “by offering issue-based leadership on topics such as digital economy, artificial intelligence and governance, it will position itself as a problem-solver rather than a disruptor”, the economist added.\n\nAn absence of American officials at this year’s G20 – after  skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  meeting in Korea as well as the  United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil  – would be “another opportunity for China”, Rosemary Foot, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It can contrast, yet again, its declared commitment to multilateralism and responsible behaviour as a major state versus the dangers of a unilateralist America focusing not on public goods but on benefits to itself only.”\n\nChina has been looking to expand its influence in Africa as a counterweight to the US-led world order. In stark contrast to Trump’s decision to end Africa’s duty-free era and slap 15-30 percent tariffs on 22 nations, Xi announced at the APEC summit last month a zero-tariff policy for all African nations with diplomatic ties to Beijing.\n\nOn that occasion, Xi emphasised China’s commitment “to joint development and shared prosperity with all countries”, stressing the country’s goal to “support more developing countries in achieving modernisation and opening up new avenues for global development”.\n\nSimilarly, Li, China’s premier, marked the United Nations’ 80th anniversary at the General Assembly in September by expressing the need for stronger collective action on climate change and emerging technologies, calling for greater solidarity to “[lift] everyone up, while division drags all down”.\n\nHis remarks were in stark contrast to Trump’s, who, in his speech, described climate change as the “ greatest con job ever perpetrated ” and called renewable sources of energy a “joke” and “pathetic”.\n\nFoot said the spotlight will now be on Beijing as it seeks to strike a similar conciliatory pose – and in doing so, set itself apart from the US – at the G20. “Whether Beijing will have a major impact on the G20 agenda is more difficult to determine,” she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/us-judge-orders-end-to-trumps-deployment-of-troops-in-washington-dc","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"00:52:32+00:00","title":"US judge orders end to Trump’s deployment of troops in Washington, DC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. federal judge, Jia Cobb, has ordered the Trump administration to immediately pause its deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, DC, ruling that the president cannot unilaterally deploy soldiers for domestic law enforcement without legal justification.

But the Trump administration has taken the controversial step to  deploy soldiers  in a growing list of Democrat-led cities, despite frequent protests from state and local officials and a lack of any emergency conditions.\n\nCobb, who said in her decision that the president cannot deploy soldiers for “whatever reason” he wants, gave the Trump administration 21 days to appeal the order before it goes into effect.\n\nLawyers for the government slammed the lawsuit that challenged the military deployment as a “frivolous stunt”.\n\n“There is no sensible reason for an injunction unwinding this arrangement now, particularly since the District’s claims have no merit,” Department of Justice lawyers wrote.\n\nTrump has also deployed troops to cities such as Los Angeles, California; Portland, Oregon; and  Chicago, Illinois , in what he depicts as an effort to tackle crime and round up undocumented immigrants.\n\nResidents and civil liberties groups have documented aggressive raids and what they say are widespread rights violations and racial profiling by federal agents during those crackdowns, in which US citizens have sometimes been swept up.\n\nTrump  has threatened  to imprison local and state officials who criticise his deployment of the military.\n\nA legal challenge filed in September by Washington, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb said that US democracy would “never be the same if these occupations are permitted to stand”.\n\nTrump ordered the first deployment in August, involving about 2,300 National Guard members from various states and hundreds of federal agents from various agencies."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/lebanon-arrests-alleged-drug-kingpin-sanctioned-by-us-state-department","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:58:58+00:00","title":"Lebanese army arrests country’s ‘most wanted’ drug trafficking suspect","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Lebanese army has arrested Noah Zaitar, the country’s most wanted drug trafficker, in Baalbek after a series of surveillance and ambush operations.

that while the Trump administration had no advance knowledge of the meeting, “the president stands by our ambassador, Mike Huckabee, and all that he is doing for the United States and Israel”.\n\nHuckabee met Pollard in July at the US embassy in Jerusalem, The New York Times revealed on Thursday.\n\nThe meeting was reportedly not on Huckabee’s official schedule and took place without the knowledge of US intelligence agencies, The Times reported, quoting two unnamed US officials.\n\nFormer US Navy intelligence analyst  Pollard was tried and convicted  in 1987 for passing thousands of highly classified US materials to Israel in exchange for cash and gifts. He was sentenced to life in prison, the harshest punishment ever given to someone for spying for an ally.\n\nPollard served 30 years before being paroled in 2015 and moving to Israel in 2020. He is regarded by some in Israel as a hero.\n\nThe case badly strained US-Israel relations at the time and is still seen as one of the most damaging breaches of classified information in US history.\n\nIn a televised interview with Israel’s i24 News outlet on Thursday, Pollard said the meeting with Huckabee had taken place at his request.\n\n“I had originally requested the interview for a very personal reason,” he said.\n\n“I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for all the efforts that he [Huckabee] had expended on my behalf when I was in prison,” he added.\n\nPollard said that he believed someone within the CIA stationed at the US embassy in Israel leaked information about the meeting to the media in an “effort to discredit” the ambassador and “have him removed” from his post.\n\n“I think the people behind this are anti-Israel elements within the Trump administration,” he said.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Huckabee sought Trump administration approval before meeting with Pollard. But the CIA were “alarmed” by news of the meeting, according to sources who spoke to The Times, as it was a breach of longstanding practice among US officials not to speak with convicted spies.\n\nHuckabee, a staunch Israel supporter and political ally of President Donald Trump, previously advocated for Pollard’s release while running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2011.\n\nIn his interview with i24 News, Pollard slammed members of the Trump administration, criticising special envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who have taken leading roles in peace talks to end Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\n“I despise Witkoff and Kushner, they were willing to meet with terrorists who massacred us on October 7 [2023],” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/21/live-israel-keeps-bombing-gaza-kills-two-in-occupied-east-jerusalem?update=4121491","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:07:09Z","title":"Israel keeps bombing Gaza, kills two in occupied East Jerusalem","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel continues its bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip, killing a displaced person south of Khan Younis city, as reported by Nasser Hospital.

from a 28-point peace plan backed by United States President Donald Trump aimed at ending Russia’s four-year war on Ukraine, with several media outlets and officials confirming that the plan, which has yet to be officially published, appears to favour Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin has not yet been informed that Ukraine is ready to hold negotiations around the plan, Russia’s RIA state news agency cited the Kremlin as saying on Friday.\n\nDetails of the plan emerged after US ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, told the UN Security Council on Thursday afternoon that the US had offered “generous terms for Russia, including sanctions relief”.\n\n“The United States has invested at the highest levels, the president of the United States personally, to end this war,” Waltz told the council.\n\nIn the meantime, Russia’s unrelenting attacks on Ukraine continue. A Russian strike on the city of Zaporizhia in southern Ukraine late on Thursday killed five people and wounded three others, emergency services said. Russia has been  gaining ground in the Zaporizhia region  that houses the southeastern Ukrainian city that straddles both banks of the Dnipro River.\n\nThe AFP news agency reported on Friday that the plan, which the US views as a “working document”, says that “Crimea, Lugansk [Luhansk] and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian, including by the United States”.\n\nThis corresponds with an  earlier report  from US media outlet Axios.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) news agency also reported on Friday that the plan would require Ukraine to surrender the Donbas, which includes the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that Ukraine currently partly holds.\n\nUnder the draft, Moscow would hold all the eastern Donbas region, even though approximately 14 percent still remains in Ukrainian hands, AP reported.\n\nAFP and AP also confirmed Axios’s earlier report that the plan would require Ukraine to limit the size of its military.\n\nAccording to AFP, the plan specifically says that the army would be limited to 600,000 personnel. Ukraine is estimated to currently have just under 900,000 active duty military staff.\n\nUkrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko shared a document showing what appeared to be the full 28-point peace plan with his 223,000 followers on the Telegram messaging app, late on Thursday, Ukraine time.\n\nRussia’s state TASS news agency also reported on details included in the document shared by Goncharenko, saying it “purportedly represents a Ukrainian translation of 28 points of the new American plan for a peace settlement in Ukraine”.\n\nNew details included in the document shared by Goncharenko include that “Ukraine has the right to EU [European Union] membership” and that the “United States will work with Ukraine to jointly restore, develop, modernise, and operate Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities”.\n\nThe document also states that Ukraine’s “Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will be commissioned under [UN nuclear agency] IAEA supervision, and the electricity generated will be shared equally between Russia and Ukraine in a 50:50 ratio”.\n\nThe text of the document shared by Goncharenko also states that “Ukrainian forces withdraw from the part of the Donetsk region that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarised buffer zone”.\n\nHanding over territory to Russia would be deeply unpopular in Ukraine and would also be illegal under Ukraine’s constitution. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out such a possibility.\n\nZelenskyy has said  he’s willing to work with the United States  on the plan, despite pushback from European allies who say that the US-backed plan heavily favours Russia. Zelenskyy’s office on Thursday confirmed that he had received a draft of the plan, and that he would speak with Trump in the coming days.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said on Telegram that “Ukraine needs peace. And real peace is one that will not be broken by a third [Russian] invasion. A dignified peace is that the conditions are respectful of our independence, our sovereignty, and the dignity of the Ukrainian people.”\n\nThe AFP news agency also reported that, according to the plan, European fighter jets would be based in Poland specifically to protect Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Kyiv would have to concede that no NATO troops would be stationed in Ukraine and that it would agree never to join the military alliance.\n\nAdditional details reported by AP include that Russia would commit to making no future attacks on Ukraine, something the White House views as a concession by Moscow.\n\nIn addition, $100bn in frozen Russian assets would be dedicated to rebuilding Ukraine, AP reported.\n\nRussia would also be re-admitted to the G8 group of nations and be integrated back into the global economy under the plan, according to AFP.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that both Ukrainians and Russians have had input into the plan, which she said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff have been quietly working on for a month."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, effective December 10, 2025, that includes platforms such as Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/students-taken-from-catholic-school-in-central-nigeria-in-latest-abduction","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:38:02+00:00","title":"Students taken from Catholic school in central Nigeria in latest abduction","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a disturbing escalation of violence in Nigeria, students from St. Mary’s Catholic School in Agwara, Niger State, were abducted by armed gangs, with reports indicating 52 students were taken.

geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/ukraine-doubts-russias-desire-for-peace-amid-reports-of-us-drafted-plan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"08:01:06+00:00","title":"Ukraine doubts Russia’s desire for peace amid reports of US-drafted plan","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine is holding firm against Russia’s military efforts to encircle and seize the eastern cities of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, despite intense aerial attacks and ground assaults.

desire for peace amid reports of US-drafted plan\n\nUkrainian defenders have been attempting to mount a defence of the surrounded eastern cities of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, a month into Russia’s latest attempt to seize them.\n\nOn Thursday, as fighting on the front lines raged, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  claimed  Russia has no interest in ending the war amid reports Washington and Moscow  have drafted  a 28-point peace plan. The proposal is said to heap pressure on Ukraine to give up land, something Kyiv has throughout the war said was a red line.\n\n“Russia has no real desire for peace; otherwise, they would not have started this war,” he said in a recorded message posted to X. “The United States has the power to ensure that Russia’s willingness to end the war finally becomes serious.”\n\nRussia dedicated 150,000 troops to capturing the enclave containing Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, Ukraine said, which is now surrounded on three sides, with Ukrainian supply lines open only to the west.\n\nZelenskyy told US senators in a bipartisan virtual meeting on November 12 that Russia had suffered its greatest casualty rate of the entire war in Pokrovsk, estimating it at 25,000 – though he did not specify over what period.\n\nUkraine’s military defence efforts were highlighted by the story of a soldier from the 155th Mechanized Battalion, who reportedly spent 100 days in the shell of a destroyed building, separated from his unit, until he was rescued.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff released a video of the fighting in Pokrovsk, purporting to show reinforcements arriving in the city, and suggesting lines of communication remained operative.\n\n“These are shots of our equipment arriving, disembarking and advancing groups. In these shots, additional assault groups are advancing into the eastern part of the city,” the video voiceover said. It said the arrivals were reinforcing the Ukrainian stronghold in the northern part of Pokrovsk.\n\nLater, the video purported to show troops “clearing positions on the western outskirts of Pokrovsk and in the area of ​​the entrance to the city. In the administrative building in the city centre, soldiers of the regiment are holding positions”.\n\nUkrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging platform: “There is an ongoing constant struggle with small enemy assault infantry groups, and, less frequently, the destruction of light enemy equipment.”\n\nThe main action belonged to drone operators on both sides, who are locked in a fierce contest for control of the skies.\n\nThe head of Ukraine’s National Guard, which is fighting in Pokrovsk, said Kyiv needs to step up drone production and acquisition to stop Russian troops while they are still out in the open.\n\n“We need to stop the enemy more as they approach on foot, so that they do not infiltrate,” Okeksandr Pivnenko told Reuters.\n\nHe said Ukraine had achieved drone parity in some parts of the front, but not all.\n\nThe Russian command appeared undecided about whether to infiltrate or surround the cities, and was pursuing a dual objective, slowing its advance, said the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank.\n\n“The Russian military command does not appear to be focusing forces and means on completing the encirclement of the Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad area, which would normally be the fastest and least costly way to seize the entire area, and instead continues to pursue some level of head-on attacks,” said the ISW.\n\nPart of Russia’s problem appeared to be the “active defence” of Dobropillia, a town to the northwest of Pokrovsk, which Russia had attempted to capture in August as part of a sweeping encirclement plan. That attack invited a counteroffensive which liberated 189 square kilometres (73sq miles) of occupied land and left the Russian encirclement in ruins.\n\nRussia’s 2nd and 51st Combined Arms Armies, attacking Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad from the south and north, respectively, appear to be attempting a more limited envelopment of the enclave and a simultaneous head-on infiltration using small groups of soldiers.\n\nThe infiltration of Pokrovsk from the south has appeared to be advancing during the past week, while Ukrainian defenders still held the northern neighbourhoods.\n\nRussia was attacking other parts of the 1,200km (745-mile) front as well, testing for weaknesses and experimenting with the infiltration tactics that have proven successful in Pokrovsk.\n\nDuring the week of November 13-19, it seized several villages in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia.\n\nOne of Russia’s advantages is its control of the air. Its aircraft are dropping  200-250 glide bombs  a day on Ukrainian front lines. Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief Vadym Skibitskyi told Reuters that Russia planned to produce 120,000 glide bombs next year, which could raise the daily average to 330.\n\n“It is possible to shoot them down, but the quantity of these aerial bombs produced in the Russian Federation … is enormous,” Skibitskyi said. “This is a threat. A threat that will require us to respond appropriately.”\n\nRussia has used long-range drones and missiles to attack Ukraine’s cities.\n\nDuring the past week, it launched just under 1,600 drones and 78 missiles. Ukraine intercepted 86 percent of the drones and three-quarters of the missiles.\n\nMany Russian drones and missiles have struck residential areas repeatedly.\n\nThe worst such attack came on November 19. At least 25 people, including children, were killed in the western Ukrainian city of  Ternopil , when Russia pulverised the top floors of a nine-storey apartment building. At least 80 others were reported wounded.\n\nUkraine, which continues to respond with attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, said it struck an oil terminal in Novorossiysk on Friday. Russia suspended export operations at the terminal, which account for 2 percent of the global oil trade.\n\nUkraine also struck the Saratov oil refinery and a fuel depot near the Engels airbase.\n\nA day later, the Ryazan refinery also suspended operations due to a strike.\n\nBut it was unclear whether this campaign was having the intended impact on Russia’s ability to provide its armed forces with diesel.\n\nRussia was reported to have lost 20 percent of refining capacity between August and October, but that was quickly reduced to 3 percent by activating spare capacity, Reuters more recently reported, citing sources and data.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zelenskyy  met with his Turkish counterpart , Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has in the past successfully interceded with Russia to broker prisoner-of-war exchanges.\n\nWhile there, Zelenskyy reportedly swerved a meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff, who was apparently bearing the 28-point peace plan from the White House.\n\nThe plan entailed territorial concessions to Russia and a reduction in the size of Ukraine’s armed forces, two anonymous sources told Reuters. Both are key Moscow demands. A Ukrainian source said Kyiv had no role in drafting the proposal.\n\nEarlier, Axios had reported that Washington was working on a 28-point peace plan.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists there were “no innovations” in Russia’s stance “that can be reported to you”.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine and its European allies have drafted a ceasefire plan that demands the complete and unconditional cessation of hostilities. Europe has not demanded that Ukraine cede territory and advocates strengthening Kyiv’s armed forces.\n\nZelenskyy clearly leans towards the European plan. His European tour started in Athens, where he and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced their intention to co-produce surface drones.\n\nOn Monday, Zelenskyy was in  Paris  to sign a 10-year deal with President Emmanuel Macron for weapons purchases and co-production, which includes 100 Rafale F4 aircraft by 2035, eight SAMP/T air defence systems with six launchers each, air defence radar, air-to-air missiles, and guided aerial bombs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spain became the first country to announce a direct allocation within the European Union’s Security Action For Europe (SAFE) programme for weapons co-production with Ukraine, in the amount of 215 million euros ($250m). Spain also promised 40 Iris-T missiles and planned to provide long-range radars.\n\nOn Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested he may provide Ukraine with the long-range Taurus cruise missiles it has long sought.\n\n“In recent months, we have been working intensively with the Ukrainian government on projects that we technically refer to as ‘long-range fire’. The Ukrainian army will be equipped with such weapon systems,” Merz said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s announcement to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing, which has been clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as involving only noncritical, non-explosive tests of weapon components, not nuclear detonations.

any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/cambodia-night-bus-plunges-off-a-bridge-killing-16-passengers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:13:24+00:00","title":"Cambodia night bus plunges off a bridge, killing 16 passengers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A night bus traveling from Oddar Meanchey province to Phnom Penh crashed off a bridge in Kampong Thom province, killing 16 passengers and injuring over 20.

at 97\n\nScientist James Watson, whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/israel-plans-to-seize-major-roman-era-historical-site-in-occupied-west-bank","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:31:49+00:00","title":"Israel plans to seize major Roman-era historical site in occupied West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has announced plans to seize over 1,800 dunams (180 hectares) of land in the Sebastia archaeological site in the occupied West Bank, marking its largest such seizure of culturally significant land.

even though it appears to heavily reflect many of Moscow's demands.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House pushed back on claims Ukraine was not involved in the drafting of the plan, which emerged after meetings between the US and Russia.\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelensky said Ukraine needed peace and would engage in diplomacy and issue no rash statements. He said Ukraine was \"ready for constructive, honest and efficient work\".\n\nBut there is deep concern about some of the reported proposals, including giving up the entire Donbas region, reducing the size of Ukraine's military, and ruling out the presence of international troops in the country - concessions which Ukraine has rejected in the past.\n\nUkrainian MP Yaroslav Yurchyshyn  told the Kyiv Independent  that Washington wanted a \"quick peace at the expense of one side, which they consider weaker\".\n\nRecent events may have further weakened Ukraine's position. Russia has made further advances in the east of the country. Moscow's long-range strikes on Ukraine's grid has left most of the country facing power cuts. Allegations of serious corruption in Ukraine's government have also led to political infighting and diverted attention from the war.\n\nAll these issues are impossible to ignore in both Washington and Moscow.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that peace will require difficult decisions on both sides. A draft published in the media does include a promise of \"reliable security guarantees\" for Ukraine.\n\nIt's believed to suggest some frozen Russian assets should be used to help rebuild Ukraine. While the draft rules out Ukraine's membership of the Nato military alliance, it keeps the door open for its membership of the European Union.\n\nEurope itself appears to have had little say over the drafting of this plan. There's no mention of the efforts led by the UK and France to provide an international reassurance force in Ukraine, should there be a ceasefire. The draft explicitly rules out the presence of foreign troops.\n\nEurope wants its voice heard. Pressure from European allies could still help Zelensky alter the draft proposals.\n\nBut there may not be much time. US officials who presented the plan, approved by US President Donald Trump, are said to be working to an aggressive timetable - weeks, not months. They're expected to travel to Moscow soon.\n\nAny hopes of getting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky in the same room to negotiate appears to have been abandoned.\n\nTrump, who's often claimed he can quickly end the war, seems to be running out of patience. He just wants the two sides to sign up to a deal."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar comet to enter the solar system, discovered in July 2025 by Larry Dennau using the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have recorded the most energetic flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpgp07zdko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"07:24:28.948+00:00","title":"Bengaluru: Men posing as Reserve Bank of India officials pull off $800,000 heist","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Armed individuals posing as Reserve Bank of India officials robbed a cash transport van in Bengaluru, Karnataka, on a busy road during daylight.

assassinated, and shortly after her divorce and remarriage.\n\nKahlo, who died in 1954, is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in the past century and became known for her personal

record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" she added.\n\nThe previous highest price at auction for a work by a female artist is Georgia O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed / White Flower No.1, which was sold at Sotheby's in 2014 for $44m.\n\nEl sueño (la cama) is one of the few Kahlo paintings in the public market since the Mexican authorities declared her artworks as artistic monuments in the 1980s, preventing them from being exported without authorisation.\n\nKahlo's story was adapted into a biographical film starring Salma Hayek in 2002, telling the story of her rocky relationship with her husband, artist Diego Rivera, and her

diplomat.\n\nAt 50 he is relatively young and he has a deep understanding of the US, having studied and worked there for several years.\n\nHe is also a man of commerce, as head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and a good fit for his opposite number in the Trump administration, special envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nDmitriev now finds himself under the spotlight over a draft peace plan that emerged after he spent three days with Witkoff in Miami.\n\nHis team has refused to comment on its proposals, which read like a Putin wishlist, requiring Ukraine to cede territory under its control and slash the size of its military.\n\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to reject its terms, but says any deal must bring a \"dignified peace, with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty\".\n\nPutin's special envoy understands modern Ukraine better than most in Moscow. He was brought up in Ukraine, and a friend claims that as a 15-year-old Dmitriev took part in pro-democracy protests in Kyiv before the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe has been a fixture of US-Russian diplomatic initiatives pretty much since the start of Trump's second presidency - and Steve Witkoff has been a regular counterpart.\n\n\"We are sure we are on the road to peace, and as peacemakers we need to make it happen,\" Dmitriev told a conference in Saudi Arabia in late October.\n\nThe pair appear to have first crossed paths in February 2025 when Putin's envoy played a role in securing the release of an American teacher from a Russian jail.\n\n\"There's a gentleman from Russia, his name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.\n\nDays later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.\n\nDmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off.\n\nWhen Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.\n\nUnlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio. He is careful to praise Trump's diplomatic skills while giving Western viewers the Russian government narrative in their own language.\n\n\"I'm not a military guy… but the position of [the] Russian military is they only hit military targets,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper recently, days after a kindergarten was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \"I'm just working to have dialogue and make sure that the conflict is ended as soon as possible.\"\n\nDmitriev certainly is not a military guy, he's a private investment specialist with an eye for a deal.\n\nWitkoff may rate him, but in 2022 during Joe Biden's presidency,  the US Treasury called him a \"known Putin ally\"   and imposed sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which he has run since 2011.\n\n\"While officially a sovereign wealth fund, RDIF is widely considered a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and is emblematic of Russia's broader kleptocracy,\" it said.\n\nDmitriev's attitude to the Biden years is pretty clear: under Biden there was no attempt to understand the Russian position, he argues, while Trump's team stopped World War Three.\n\nIt is claimed that Dmitriev has accumulated a real estate fortune with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.\n\nPopova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.\n\nHis rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.\n\nThat scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.\n\nDmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.\n\nWhile Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.\n\nHis relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"\n\nHe later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".\n\nAfter earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.\n\nDmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.\n\nBy 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nIncreasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.\n\nHe was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.\n\nHis overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.\n\nThe Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.\n\nMuch of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity.\n\nHe proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.\n\nHe has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.\n\nDmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where  sanctions have been imposed on him  for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dnd9pxpzeo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"06:17:30.882+00:00","title":"Laos methanol poisoning: Victim's brother pushes for answers","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Six tourists, including 28-year-old trainee lawyer Simone White, died after consuming free alcohol shots at the Nana Backpacker Hostel in Vang Vieng, Laos, which were contaminated with methanol.

brother pushes for answers\n\nAt Zak White's family home you don't have to look far to spot a photo of his older sister, Simone.\n\nThere are shots of graduations, holidays - typical reminders of special moments and milestones.\n\nSimone's passion, though, was seeing the world.\n\nLate last year, she headed out on what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime, backpacking with mates in Laos, south-east Asia.\n\n\"She was really excited because she was going out there to meet up with her friend Bethany [Clarke], who she hadn't seen for seven months,\" Zak tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\nHe says his 28-year-old sister, a trainee lawyer, was a \"very experienced traveller\", so seeing her off was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe siblings' farewell was \"more just wishing her to go and have a nice time\", says Zak.\n\n\"'See you when you're back', kind of thing.\"\n\nIt was the last time he would see her.\n\nSimone was one of six tourists who died after drinking free shots at a hostel in Vang Vieng, Laos' famous party town.\n\nIt is thought those drinks were tainted with methanol, a toxic substance normally found in paint thinner but that is sometimes mixed with alcohol illegally to cut costs.\n\nSimone and Bethany started to feel unwell after their night at the Nana Backpacker Hostel, when about 100 guests were given free shots.\n\nAfter the friends were admitted to hospital and diagnosed with methanol poisoning, Simone's family was contacted.\n\n\"I remember my mum got told it was serious and she should go and fly out there. I remember it not kind of really feeling real,\" says Zak.\n\nSimone was eventually put on life support - but it was too late.\n\n\"Not really knowing what was going on, that was quite difficult,\" says Zak.\n\n\"I didn't think she was ever going to die.\"\n\nHe says losing Simone still weighs heavy on him.\n\n\"I don't drink, but when I go out to bars and things with my friends I still get a bit nervous and anxious when I'm at a bar and they drink shots and things,\" he says.\n\n\"It kind of brings it all back, really.\"\n\nWhile the future of the Nana hostel remains unclear, Zak says Simone's family are no closer to getting answers about who's responsible for her death.\n\nEmails from the UK and Australian governments, seen by Newsbeat, claim charges have been proposed against 13 people in Laos.\n\nThey're accused of offences linked to food safety breaches, which would not find anyone legally responsible for Simone's death.\n\nReports have suggested the hostel  is preparing to reopen with a new name .\n\n\"I can't believe it's trying to reopen,\" says Zak.\n\n\"It's taken six people's lives.\n\n\"I just feel sorry and worried for any young traveller that's going there, because they're almost playing Russian roulette with their lives if this hostel reopens.\"\n\nBackpackers have told Newsbeat Vang Vieng is a \"ghost town\" heading into high season, and tourism may have been affected by the deaths and investigation that followed.\n\nNewsbeat has attempted to contact the Nana Backpacker Hostel's owner and authorities in Laos for comment.\n\nSimone's family say they've found themselves having to chase the UK government for new information on the investigation, with the last substantial update in May.\n\nZak says the Foreign Office, the government department that deals with deaths abroad, could have done more.\n\nIt says it's been \"working hard\" to raise awareness of the risk of methanol poisoning since last November.\n\nThis has included  highlighting 27 countries  deemed high-risk, and  working with content creators  to spread messages on social media.\n\nBut Zak doesn't think these steps are enough.\n\nHe echoes the feelings of Simone's friend, Bethany,  who has also expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the Foreign Office's campaign.\n\n\"I'd love for there to be a push from the prime minister to try and get some more information from the Laos government,\" he says.\n\nBBC Newsbeat put the family's criticisms of the government and concerns about the awareness campaign to the Foreign Office.\n\nIn response, the department said: \"No family should endure what the campaigners' families, including the family of Simone White, have suffered.\n\n\"Their determination to prevent others facing the same tragedy has been instrumental in driving forward these vital updates to our travel advice.\"\n\nSimone's family remains frustrated with the lack of information from Laos.\n\n\"I think we've perhaps accepted we're not going to get answers, but that shouldn't be the case,\" says Zak.\n\n\"There's been no justice at all, really.\n\n\"We just want to know what's going on.\"\n\nHis thoughts turn to Simone, and the memories that remain.\n\n\"She always wanted the best for me.

Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity, in a move that made headlines around the world.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization condemned Mr Nawat's behaviour as \"malicious\" and Mr Rocha, speaking by video from Mexico, told his Thai business partner to just \"stop\".\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum praised Ms Bosch at that time as an \"example of how we women should speak out\" in the face of aggression.\n\nDuring Friday's finals, Mr Nawat posted photos from the audience on his Instagram stories but he was not seen on stage.\n\nAfter Ms Bosch's crowning, he posted a one-line statement in Thai on his social media accounts, saying: \"A billion words that cannot be said\".\n\nHe also told reporters: \"As for the outcome, we leave it to the viewers at home to judge... people everywhere can make their own assessment.\"\n\nOn social media, some fans said the backstage drama helped Ms Bosch clinch the crown, which is Mexico's fourth.\n\n\"Next year, whoever walks out will win,\" one comment read, while another said: \"They had to crown her to make up for injustice earlier to save Miss Universe!\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted the Miss Universe Organization for comment.\n\nOn its social media accounts, the organisation praised Ms Bosch, saying \"her grace, strength, and radiant spirit captured the hearts of the world\".\n\nA week after the walkout controversy,  two judges resigned  with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.\n\nLebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the final on Friday.\n\nHours later, former French football star Claude Makelele also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization rejected Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\".\n\nOn Friday, minutes after Ms Bosch's win was announced, Mr Harfouch posted a statement online repeating his allegations of rigging.\n\nIn a separate incident, during the preliminary evening gown round on Wednesday night, Miss Jamaica accidentally fell onstage and had to be rushed out of the theatre in a stretcher.\n\nClips of the incident were shared widely on social media. Organisers later said she was hospitalised but had no broken bones and was \"under good care\".\n\nThe recent controversies, analysts say, underscore the cultural and strategic differences between Miss Universe's Thai and Mexican owners.\n\nThe pageant events are being organised by Mr Nawat, who is known to fans as the founder and owner of Miss Grand International, a smaller Thai-based contest that is known for its loud social media presence.\n\nMr Nawat holds the licence to host this year's Miss Universe pageant, while the Miss Universe Organization is being run out of Mexico by businessman Raul Rocha.\n\nIt is a relatively new leadership, brought in just before the pageant began.\n\nThai transgender media mogul Anne Jakrajutatip had previously owned the event, having acquired the pageant from US entertainment company Endeavor in 2022. She made sweeping changes towards inclusivity, allowing transgender women, married women and women with children to participate. She also scrapped the age cap for contestants.\n\nAs audiences declined over the years, she sought to monetise the Miss Universe brand, stamping it on merchandise such as bottled water and bags.\n\nIn 2023,  her entertainment company JKN, filed for bankruptcy, citing \"liquidity problems\" .\n\nShe resigned as CEO of JKN just before this year's pre-pageant events and was replaced by Guatemalan diplomat Mario Bucaro.\n\nBefore she resigned, Ms Jakrajutatip brought in Mr Rocha from Mexico as business partner and later tapped Mr Nawat to organise the 2025 pageant.\n\nIt has been a \"very rocky transition\" for the pageant's leadership, Dani Walker, an American beauty queen and pageant coach told the BBC. She said important roles were now split between leaders in Bangkok and Mexico.\n\nThe leadership structure was much clearer when the pageant was being run by Endeavor, and before that, Donald Trump, she said.\n\n\"For fans and outsiders, it's very confusing. No one knows who the real leaders are or who to ask when they have questions, and that's very damaging to the brand,\" Paula Shugart, who served as Miss Universe Organization president under the previous two owners, told the BBC.\n\nThitiphong Duangkhong, a scholar of women's and Latin American studies and an expert on beauty pageants, said those behind the pageant should be aware of their cultural differences.\n\n\"In our country, we use the Thai language to communicate with our fellow Thais. We understand the social context, we understand social structure, we understand the inequality of power in society, and we constantly try to negotiate with it using the Thai language,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMr Thitiphong said Ms Jakrajutatip being a transwoman might not have sat well with some Latin American fans who subscribe to macho culture.\n\n\"There's talk of women who aren't women suddenly buying a pageant that's supposed to be about women's entertainment. What's going to happen?\"\n\nThe crowning of the new Miss Universe, the 74th since 1952, signals the resolve of an organisation to stay relevant and evolve from a once-a-year television spectacle to a media brand that is ready for TikTok.\n\nFor years, audiences for the Miss Universe broadcast have been declining steadily as fans shift to social media.\n\nOn TikTok and Instagram, former titleholders, even runners up, now maintain accounts with millions of followers, transforming them into influencers.\n\nIt is in this e-commerce universe that Mr Nawat's Miss Grand International queens are expected to embrace - selling merchandise in live broadcasts - which he tried to introduce to Miss Universe.\n\nBut on the Latin American side, beauty queens are still regarded as glamorous television celebrities.\n\nA Miss Universe reality show was even staged for that audience and the winner - a Dominican crowned Miss Universe Latina - competed in the main pageant in Bangkok.\n\nThe contest still remains very popular in Latin America and South East Asia, where pageant crowns have become a way out of poverty or an express pass for girls dreaming of becoming a celebrity.\n\nBut it has continued to face questions of its relevancy and constant criticism that it sexually objectifies women.\n\nOrganisers have made accommodations in recent years. While the majority of contestants wore two piece bikinis for the 2025 contest's swimsuit round, those from conservative countries were allowed to wear full-body coverings.\n\n\"Of course, it won't be for everyone, and there will always be those who disagree. But as long as the core values ​​are intact, I think pageants will always have a role to play in society,\" said Ms Shugart, the former president.\n\nShe said empowering women should be at the organisation's core.\n\n\"Miss Universe is nothing if you're not empowering the women that compete.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj414lgjykpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:36:18.845+00:00","title":"BBC News quiz of the week: Why was KPop Demon Hunters banned by a school?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article presents a quiz question about a fictional or satirical scenario in which a school banned a KPop group called 'Demon Hunters,' but it does not provide factual evidence or details to support this claim.

on 'their vision' for ending Ukraine war\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to work with the US on \"their vision\" for ending the war with Russia.\n\nUnder the widely leaked plan, Kyiv would cede significant areas of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that it still controls, cut the size of its army, and pledge not to join Nato - proposals it has previously ruled out.\n\nThe White House has pushed back on claims that Ukraine was not involved in the drafting of the plan, which emerged following meetings between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and and Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nProvisions in the draft plan come across as heavily slanted towards Moscow - and it received a carefully diplomatic response from Kyiv.\n\nUkraine has relied heavily on US military support since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, but President Donald Trump has shifted the US position so that further aid is funded by its Nato allies and securing a peace deal has become a priority.\n\nThe draft Witkoff-Dmitriev plan emerged as Russia claimed small territorial gains in eastern Ukraine and Zelensky faced a domestic crisis implicating top officials  in a $100m (£76) million corruption scandal .\n\nIn his nightly address, the Ukrainian leader said US military officials in Kyiv had  \"presented its proposals, the points of a plan to end the war - their vision\".\n\n\"From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace - one that will not be broken by a third invasion.\"\n\nKyiv and its European allies have long supported the idea of a \"just and lasting\" peace that would ensure no more of Ukraine is taken by Russia. Moscow has already annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula as well as four regions it partly occupies through the current, full-scale invasion.\n\nHowever, European leaders have been left out of the US-Russia plan and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said from his perspective it was not yet a fully fledged plan but rather \"a list of topics and options\", citing remarks by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe leaked draft proposes limiting Ukraine's military limited to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.\n\nKyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", although details are not given.   \"It is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.\n\nThe draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.\n\nZelensky said he was set to speak to Trump in the coming days about the proposals, which also include plans for Ukraine to forgo many of its weapons.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected suggestions that the proposals would constitute major concessions from Ukraine - and that Ukraine had been frozen out, saying the US had engaged \"equally with both sides\".\n\nWitkoff and Rubio had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and had engaged both sides \"to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace\", she said.\n\n\"It's a good plan for both,\" Leavitt added, without providing further details. \"We believe that it should be acceptable to both sides. And we're working very hard to get it done.\"\n\nAn unnamed senior US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the plan \"was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky's administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky\".\n\nOne Ukrainian MP told the BBC that Kyiv had not been involved in initial discussions, but brought in later on.\n\nZelensky's office issued a carefully worded statement earlier on Thursday, saying the plan \"in the American side's assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy\".\n\nIn August Trump came away from a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska empty-handed. The US president became increasingly frustrated with negotiations with Moscow, culminating in Trump imposing fresh sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil producers which come into force on Friday.\n\nZelensky has been careful not to publicly criticise or reject the plan, saying he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.\n\nBut he stressed that Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected.\n\nThe statement came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between Zelensky and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.\n\nWhen asked if Europe was involved in the process of drafting the plan, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: \"Not that I know of.\"\n\nShe added: \"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans onboard.\"\n\nUkraine's European allies have now had to take on much of the funding for Kyiv's military and financial aid, and countries including the UK and France have offered to provide forces to ensure any peace holds.\n\nMoscow, meanwhile, has downplayed the significance of the 28-point plan.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that, while there had been \"contacts\" with the US, there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".\n\nPeskov warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender.\n\nSince starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine including several visits by his envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders.\n\nBut as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict.\n\nWhile Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated.\n\nLate on Thursday, a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least five people, according to the regional governor. Hours later, Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 33 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions.\n\nEarlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:09:08.794+00:00","title":"Australia's social media ban for kids under 16 - how will it work?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has implemented a world-first ban on children under 16 from accessing social media platforms, requiring companies like Meta, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, and others to take 'reasonable steps' to block or deactivate underage accounts.

media companies will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.\n\nThe government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from \"design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing\".\n\nA study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.\n\nOne in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.\n\nThe Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.\n\nIt is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord  have recently introduced age checks  on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban.\n\nThe government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.\n\nThese comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.\n\nYouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.\n\nChildren and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.\n\nThe government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.\n\nSeveral possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.\n\nThe government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads,  has announced  it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said.\n\nThe other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.\n\nWithout a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.\n\nThe government's  own report  found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.\n\nQuestions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".\n\nCritics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently  made headlines  for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.\n\nOthers point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.\n\nCommunications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\".\n\n\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"\n\nCritics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages.\n\nAustralia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.\n\nBut the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches.\n\nIt also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.\n\nSocial media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy.\n\nThey also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies.\n\nYouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nEven as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\".\n\nAt parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it.\n\nKick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.\n\nThe ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.\n\nIn the UK,  new safety rules  introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.\n\nOther European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a  French parliamentary enquiry  recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.\n\nDenmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.\n\nMeanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.\n\nTeens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.\n\nOnline, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.\n\nSome teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmgjx1jego","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:24:27.008+00:00","title":"Anti-Hamas armed groups seek future role under Gaza peace plan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing number of armed groups in Gaza—such as the Popular Forces led by Yasser Abu Shabab and the Counter-Terrorism Strike Force led by Hossam al-Astal—are emerging to oppose Hamas.

Anti-Hamas armed groups seek future role under Gaza peace plan\n\nUrgent questions are being raised over a patchwork of armed groups that have emerged to fight Hamas in Gaza over recent months.\n\nThey include groups based around family clans, criminal gangs and new militia – some of which are backed by Israel, as its prime minister recently admitted.\n\nElements within the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank and is a political rival to Hamas - are also believed to be covertly sending support.\n\nBut these militia - each operating in its own local area inside the 53% of Gaza's territory currently controlled by Israeli forces - have not been officially included in US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for an International Stabilisation Force and a newly-trained Palestinian police force to secure Gaza in the next stage of the deal.\n\nOne of the largest militia is headed by Yasser Abu Shabab, whose Popular Forces operate near the southern city of Rafah.\n\nIn one recent social media video, his deputy talks about working in co-ordination with the Board of Peace - the international body to be tasked with running Gaza under the plan.\n\nHossam al-Astal, who leads a militia called the Counter-Terrorism Strike Force near the southern city of Khan Younis, told Israeli media this week that \"US representatives\" had confirmed his group would have a role in Gaza's future police force.\n\nA US official said they had nothing to announce at this time.\n\nEarlier this month, Astal grinned when I asked if he had spoken to the Americans about the future, and told me he would share the details soon.\n\nI asked if those conversations left him happy.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, with a big smile.\n\nHossam al-Astal once worked for the Palestinian Authority. His group is small - maybe tens of fighters - but is increasingly confident, and runs a well-supplied tent city near Khan Younis.\n\n\"Let's say it's not the right time for me to answer this question,\" Astal smiled when I asked if Israel was supplying him.  \"But we co-ordinate with the Israeli side to bring in food, weapons, everything.\"\n\nI asked how he paid for them.\n\n\"People all over the world are supporting us,\" he replied. \"It's not all from Israel. They claim Israel is the only one supporting us and that we are agents of Israel. We are not Israel's agents.\"\n\nHe told me tens of families had come to live in his new site, just inside the Yellow Line that marks the territory currently controlled by Israel under the ceasefire deal - and that more people were arriving every week.\n\n\"We are the next day for the new Gaza,\" he told me. \"We have no problem co-operating with the Palestinian Authority, with the Americans, with anyone who aligns with us. We are the alternative to Hamas.\"\n\nBut many Gazans - including those disillusioned with Hamas - are unhappy with the new power given to these small and fragmented armed groups.\n\n\"Only a small number of men who have no religion, faith, or ethics have joined these criminals,\" said Saleh Sweidan, who is currently living in Gaza City.  \"Gaza's government was ruling us, and although there were many burdens on civilians, any government is better than gangs.\"\n\n\"These groups that co-operate with the occupation [Israel] are the worst thing that the war has produced,\" said Zaher Doulah, another Gaza City resident. \"Joining them is not only dangerous, it is a great betrayal.\"\n\nThirty-one year old Montaser Masoud told me he had joined al-Astal's new tent city two months ago with his wife and four children, crossing the Yellow Line at night to avoid Hamas, and after coordination with Israeli forces.\n\nBut he said relatives who had stayed behind in Hamas-controlled areas were critical of the move.\n\n\"They've been harassing us, saying what we're doing it wrong and has no future,\" he told me. \"I tell them that they're the ones we worry about, because they live outside the Yellow Line and anyone from Hamas could hide next to them, and they could be bombed.\"\n\nAs we spoke by phone, the sound of heavy gunfire around him repeatedly punctured our conversation.\n\n\"It's the [Israeli] army nearby,\" he explained. \"But it's not a problem because we know we're not the target.\"\n\nSeveral armed groups are now ranged against Hamas, with complex and overlapping ties.\n\nAbu Shabab's group, for example, is accused of looting aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, and reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).\n\n\"What's wrong with it?\" Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last month in response to the news that his country had secretly backed militia groups.  \"It's a good thing. It saves soldiers' lives.\"\n\nDisclosing the information, he said, had \"only helped Hamas\".\n\nNetanyahu has insisted Gaza will not be run by either Hamas or its rival, the Palestinian Authority. Under the US peace plan, a non-political, technocratic committee of Palestinians will run Gaza in the short term under international oversight, until the PA reforms are complete.\n\nBut a senior Palestinian official has rejected Astal's claims that his fighters will form part of the future police force there.\n\nMaj-Gen Anwar Rajab, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority's security forces, told the BBC that there could be no blanket integration of men from Gaza's armed groups, some of which are backed by Israel.\n\n\"Israel might demand the integration of these militia, due to Israel's own specific political and security considerations,\" he said in an interview in the West Bank city of Ramallah.  \"But Israel's demands don't necessarily benefit the Palestinians. Israel wants to continue imposing its control in one way or another in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThe question of what will happen to Gaza's new militia under a durable peace still remains unanswered.\n\nIsrael's decision to back the enemies of their enemy in Gaza is a sign they have not learned from history, according to Michael Milshtein, formerly the head of Palestinian affairs for Israel's military intelligence.\n\n\"This is the same risk the Americans took in Afghanistan 30 years ago,\" he said. \"They supported the Taliban against the Soviets, then the Taliban took the weapons they got from the Americans and used them against the Americans.\"\n\nHe said Israel was now relying on groups with dubious pasts in the hope they would provide a political social and ideological alternative to Hamas.\n\n\"There will be a moment when they will turn their rifles – the rifles they got from Israel – against the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces],\" he said.\n\nAside from helping to weaken Hamas, Israel's support for armed groups could make it easier to divide Palestinian opposition to Israel, and maintain influence inside Gaza once its forces withdraw.\n\nSome critics say that arming disparate local groups will make it harder to persuade Hamas to disarm, and for international forces to step into the role of securing Gaza.\n\nBut the risk for Israel is that the same groups it is helping to arm will one day become the new enemy it faces.\n\nForty years ago, it encouraged a hardline Islamist organisation in Gaza to offset the growing power of Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.\n\nThat organisation became Hamas.\n\nAdditional reporting by Naomi Scherbel-Ball, Samantha Granville and the Gaza freelance team"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33mnvy5zppo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"09:04:24.987+00:00","title":"Venezuela says opposition leader will become fugitive if she collects Nobel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader, is named as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her efforts to promote democratic transition from dictatorship to democracy.

Nobel\n\nVenezuela's opposition leader will be considered a \"fugitive\" if she travels to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, the nation's attorney general has said.\n\nTarik William Saab told news agency AFP that María Corina Machado - who has been living in hiding to avoid arrest - was accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, and terrorism\".\n\nThe 58-year-old was named as the prestigious prize's recipient in October, being praised for her efforts towards a \"peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".\n\nShe has long denounced President Nicolás Maduro's government as \"criminal\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. Many nations view his rule as illegitimate.\n\nMachado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.\n\nThe elections were  widely dismissed on the international stage  as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.\n\nDespite her barring, Machado was able to unite Venezuela's opposition behind her little-known surrogate on the ballot, Edmundo González.\n\nThe government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide.\n\nGonzález later  fled to Spain , fearing repression.

finds\n\nThe murder of two police officers at a rural Australian property in 2022 was not a religious terror attack, Queensland's state coroner has found – despite authorities previously declaring it the first such case in the nation's history.\n\nConstables Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow were on a routine visit to the property at Wieambilla in December 2022 when Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train ambushed and killed them.\n\nThe attack triggered an hours-long siege which ended with police fatally shooting the trio.\n\nNow, in findings released on Friday, authorities have declared that the ambush was not an act of terrorism, while acknowledging that the Trains were religious fanatics and conspiracy theorists.\n\nState Coroner Terry Ryan said the trio acted \"defensively within their delusional framework to defend themselves and their property from what they regarded was an evil advance on them\".\n\n\"In the months before 12 December 2022, they had been seeking to dissuade police engagement with them on their property, just as they took detailed steps to fortify their property against such engagement and waited to ambush any police who crossed their boundary,\" Mr Ryan said.\n\n\"For these reasons, I accept the submission that it is not possible to conclude that Gareth, Stacey and Nathaniel committed a terrorist act.\"\n\nMr Ryan further acknowledged that Australia's legal definition of terrorism, as laid out in 2002 to respond to \"large, well-planned and well-financed activities\", is \"unhelpfully narrow and may not reflect the current security landscape\".\n\nArnold and McCrow – aged 26 and 29, respectively – were among four officers who visited the remote property, located about 270km (168 miles) west of the Queensland capital of Brisbane, on 12 December 2022.\n\nThey were there to check on a man who had been reported missing in the neighbouring state of New South Wales.\n\n\"For us, this was a standard job. We go to thousands of these every week,\" Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll has said.\n\nAfter arriving at the property, leaving their cars and approaching the house, however, the officers were inundated with gunfire from high-powered rifles and shotguns.\n\nArnold and McCrow were hit immediately. A third officer ran to find cover, while the fourth was able to retreat into his car, suffering a bullet wound to his leg on the way.\n\nPolice would later tell the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the \"ruthless, murderous\" Trains executed Arnold and McCrow while they were laying on the ground.\n\nAt some point a neighbour, 58-year-old Alan Dare, also turned up at the property, reportedly after spotting smoke. He was fatally shot in the back.\n\nIn his findings, Mr Ryan said it was \"difficult to see how any responding officers could have been adequately equipped to respond to the events as they unfolded\".\n\nSenior Sergeant Tracy Bailey of Queensland police, who was quoted in the findings, said \"it would appear that the offenders were prepared for a lethal confrontation with any person that entered the property and there was nothing the officers could have done to prevent this.\n\n\"The offenders were waiting for them.\"\n\nNathaniel Train was found to be Arnold's killer, and his brother Gareth was found to have killed McCrow.\n\nNathaniel Train was a former school principal. He was also the missing man police were at the property to check on.\n\nGareth Train and his wife Stacey co-owned the property.\n\nThe coronial inquest found that Gareth Train had developed anti-government and conspiracy theorist views over the course of several years, and that his attraction to the latter appeared to have intensified after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, where 35 people were killed by a lone gunman at a small town in Tasmania.\n\nIn 2012, Gareth Train complained that his phone had been tapped and said he was suspicious of police. By 2014, he spent significant periods of time researching conspiracy theories, Mr Ryan found.\n\nThese interests intensified in later years as Gareth Train became increasingly isolated, particularly during the Covid pandemic, and began communicating online with other fringe organisations and anti-government news forums.\n\nIn September 2020, he wrote in an online post: \"Be warned QPS [Queensland Police Service] you all have a choice to make be on the right side, or face execution after\".\n\nHis comments and online rhetoric would later become increasingly religious, and his wife and his brother soon shifted in a similar direction – with both of them increasingly referencing what they saw as the approaching end times.\n\nThe inquest heard that the Trains' conspiracy theories and beliefs caused significant conflict between them and their families.\n\nIt also heard that NSW police did not pass on emails, including several from Nathaniel Train's wife, that might have alerted Queensland officers to the danger of engaging with the trio.\n\nMr Ryan said this was \"regrettable\", noting that \"the missed opportunities for further inquiries to have been made must be extremely distressing for the families of Constable Arnold, Constable McCrow and Mr Dare\".\n\nMr Ryan made 10 recommendations focused on improving police safety, including the provision of more drones for remote and rural police to help make risk assessments.\n\nAustralia introduced some of the world's strictest gun regulations after the Port Arthur massacre.\n\nSome of those regulations have since been watered down in various parts of Australia over the past 20 years, experts in gun control have warned – pointing out that some laws are not uniform across different states."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p783g2j5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"01:52:15.432+00:00","title":"Scientists reveal what triggered Santorini 'earthquake swarm'","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, a large swarm of over 25,000 earthquakes occurred beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi, prompting concerns about a potential eruption of the underwater Kolumbo volcano or a major earthquake like the 1956 event.

this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.\n\nThey used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust.\n\nThey used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.\n\nOne of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.\n\nMany tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.\n\nThe scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.\n\nThe team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor between the two islands of Santorini and Anydros.\n\nThe researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors.\n\nLead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\n\n\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"\n\nFor now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\n\n\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"\n\nVolcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.\n\nAnd these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\n\n\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"19:09:00.870+00:00","title":"Where are US warships stationed near Venezuela and why are they there?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US has significantly escalated its military presence in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific near Venezuela, deploying the world’s largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, along with aircraft carriers, destroyers, amphibious assault ships, and advanced fighter jets.

Venezuela.\n\nThe military build-up is the largest US presence in Latin America in decades and has sparked speculation about the potential for some kind of military action against Venezuela.\n\nThis comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific in recent months, which the Trump administration says are necessary to stem the flow of drugs.\n\nThe build-up in the Caribbean began in August with the deployment of air and naval forces, including a nuclear-powered submarine and spy planes  according to US officials.\n\nIt now includes a range of aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nBBC Verify has confirmed the locations of six warships in the region this month by cross referencing ship-tracking data and satellite imagery.\n\nThis includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, described by the US Navy as \"the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world\".\n\nThe ship, which travels in a strike group with other supporting vessels, is more than 330 metres (1,100 feet) long.\n\nBBC Verify has identified several other vessels in the Caribbean Sea - including a guided missile destroyer, an amphibious transport dock, a guided missile cruiser, and an amphibious assault ship.\n\nWe have also located a vessel which appears to be the MV Ocean Trader. This is the US Special Operations Command mothership which can serve as a base for 200 troops and has hangar bays for several helicopters.\n\nThe US has also deployed  F-35 fighter jets to its bases in the Caribbean , and has flown bombers and spy planes over the region.\n\nIn October, three B-52 bombers took off from an airbase in Louisiana and circled off the coast of Venezuela before returning, according to flight tracking data from FlightRadar24.\n\nAnd last month tracking data shows several P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircrafts flew south over the Caribbean from a US naval base in Florida.\n\nExperts say these flights suggest the US is trying to gather military intelligence from the region.\n\n\"We see activity by P-8As around the world anywhere the US Navy has an interest in boosting its marine domain awareness,\" says Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nUS President Donald Trump has also acknowledged that he authorised the  CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that might mean remains highly classified.\n\nThe build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\n\"The level of forces, and the fact that they are plainly not tailored for the purpose of pure drug interdiction has raised suspicions the US may be heading towards war with Venezuela,\" says Mr Ziemer.\n\n\"The escalation risks are significant, but I think that within the Trump Administration there is still considerable debate over what will come next,\" he adds.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the Trump told CBS' 60 Minutes on 3 November: \"I doubt it… But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response in November they declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\n\"Overall, I believe the pace of strikes against targets at sea will increase in the near future, while the United States tries to make up its mind about whether it can strike inside Venezuela,\" says Mr Ziemer.\n\nBetween 2 September and 19 November, US forces hit at least 22 vessels in 21 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nUS Southern Command  announced that its latest strike , conducted on Saturday in eastern Pacific international waters, killed three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board.\n\nCollectively, at least 83 people have been killed, according to statements from US officials.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified the people killed, they have alleged they were all \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nAn  investigation from the Associated Press reported  that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nTrump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to the US.\n\nIn a statement, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which has been officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nIn some cases, US officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nBut some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Edgington and Bernd Debusmann Jr. Graphics by Leo Scutt-Richter."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgexdjp0qj8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:52:31.821+00:00","title":"UK expected to approve plans for Chinese mega embassy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK government is expected to approve China’s plans for a new mega embassy in central London at Royal Mint Court, which would be the largest of its kind in Europe.

expected to approve plans for Chinese mega embassy\n\nThe UK government is expected to approve China's plans for a new mega embassy in central London.\n\nA final decision has not yet been formally taken, but the advice ministers are understood to have received from the intelligence agencies clears the path for the controversial project to be given the go ahead.\n\nThe expected green light –  first reported by the Times newspaper  – will become the latest case study in the growing public argument about how wise a close relationship with Beijing is.\n\nThe approval or rejection of the planning application lies with the Housing Secretary Steve Reed – in what is known as a quasi-judicial decision.\n\nBut given the sensitivities of this judgement call, many others have been consulted – including MI5 and MI6.\n\nThe decision  has repeatedly been delayed  and last month the government pushed back a deadline to rule on the application to 10 December.\n\nThe site at Royal Mint Court is close to the City of London, and fibre optic cables that carry vast quantities of highly sensitive data,  sparking concerns it could pose an espionage risk .\n\nThe embassy, at 20,000 square metres, would be the biggest of its kind anywhere in Europe.\n\nSome have argued that a single site, rather than multiple sites across London, may be easier to manage and there is an awareness in government that rejecting China's long-standing desire for its new embassy could set back diplomatic relations.\n\nHowever, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel warned that approving the embassy would put Britain at risk, accusing Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being \"desperate and unprincipled\".\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in the UK has previously said the new complex would enhance \"mutually beneficial cooperation\" between China and Britain, with officials arguing objections to the site are unjustified.\n\nSince winning the general election last year, Labour has sought to thaw the UK's relationship with Beijing.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves, Business Secretary Peter Kyle and the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office, Sir Olly Robbins, have all been on visits to China.\n\nThe prime minister is expected to make his own trip to the country, perhaps as soon as early next year.\n\nAsked about the prospect of heading there, he told reporters en route to the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, that no visit was confirmed yet.\n\nHe said the government's approach to China \"is the same approach as we've always taken, which is cooperate where we can and challenge where we must, particularly on national security\".\n\nCritics say the government is insufficiently hard-headed about what they see as the threat posed by Beijing, and argue for a much greater caution in the UK's relationship.\n\nDame Priti said: \"It beggars belief that Starmer is jetting off to Beijing just months after the case against the alleged Chinese spies collapsed on his watch.\"\n\nShe added: \"Keir Starmer is so weak, and our economy so precarious, that Labour feels it must kowtow to China at every opportunity, regardless of the cost to our country.\"\n\nIn September a case involving two men - including a former parliamentary researcher - who were accused of spying for China  collapsed in controversial circumstances . Both men denied wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors said the case was dropped because they could not get evidence from the government referring to China as a national security threat.\n\nHowever, ministers insisted they were frustrated it collapsed and blamed the position of the previous Conservative government, as well as out-of-date national security legislation.\n\nEarlier this week MI5 issued an alert to MPs and peers, warning they faced a significant risk of spying from the Chinese state.\n\nThe alert said individuals working on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security were posing as \"headhunters\" on platforms like LinkedIn and targeting people working in British politics to obtain insider information.\n\nChina has rejected claims of espionage as \"pure fabrication\".\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8vnv3dk0vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-21","timeOfPublication":"10:20:06.103+00:00","title":"Nathan Gill: How WhatsApp messages revealed ex-Reform politician's pro-Russian bribes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nathan Gill, a former UKIP and Brexit Party MEP, has admitted to eight counts of bribery for promoting pro-Russian narratives in the European Parliament.

Gill  pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery  in September.\n\nFarage, now leader of Reform UK, said he was \"stunned\" that Gill, a former Mormon bishop would have done this.\n\nFarage said he had no knowledge of his \"shameful activities\" and condemned them \"in every possible way\".\n\nGill was first elected as an MEP for the now defunct UK Independence Party in 2014 and rose through its ranks.\n\nHe led UKIP in Wales and was also elected to the Welsh Parliament in 2016.\n\nGill played a prominent role in the Brexit campaign in Wales and was one of only two MEPs who followed Farage from UKIP into the Brexit Party in 2019.\n\nHe had previously told the BBC he had responsibility for The Brexit Party's group of MEPs as its \"head of delegation\". He said that meant he told them where to sit and would \"keep them in line\".\n\nHis WhatsApp chat history reveals that by this point, Voloshyn had helped prepare two of Gill's contributions to parliamentary debates in December 2018 and March 2019.\n\nGill had visited Ukraine in May 2018 and was with Voloshyn at an event to commemorate the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.\n\nThat was four years after  Putin's forces had annexed Crimea  while Russia were also supporting separatists fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine happened in 2022.\n\nThat trip to Ukraine – the first of three in 2018 – was arranged by a Polish man called Janusz Niedźwiecki, who is awaiting trial in Poland on charges of spying for Russia.\n\nWhile Gill, originally from Hull, deepened his connections in Ukraine, his ties to UKIP frayed and in December 2018 he followed Farage out of the party.\n\nProsecutors say he committed his first offence around this time - and that Voloshyn used the codewords \"xmas gifts\" and \"post cards\" to refer to cash in WhatsApps to Gill.\n\nIn return for the bribe, Gill read from a script in a European Parliament debate, where he raised concerns about threats in Ukraine to close two TV channels - 112 Ukraine and NewsOne.\n\nBoth were connected to Viktor Medvedchuk, a super-rich Ukrainian oligarch whose daughter has Putin as her godfather.\n\nGill had visited the TV channels with fellow MEPs David Coburn and Jonathan Arnott in October 2018, both of whom spoke up for the broadcasters in the same debate as Gill.\n\nCoburn and Gill were on an \"international editorial board\" for 112, together with Voloshyn.\n\nArnott said if Gill had offered him money, he would have gone to the police.\n\nHe also said he criticised Russia in his speech.\n\n\"I find the very suggestion that when I'm criticising Russia, that somehow I'll be in any way reacting to something Russia would have wanted me to do... it's provably nonsensical,\" Arnott told the BBC.\n\nThe TV stations were threatened with closure, Arnott said and added that Gill told him \"it was a freedom of speech issue\".\n\nThe BBC has tried contacting Coburn, the former UKIP leader in Scotland, but has not received a response.\n\nOver the course of seven months in 2018 and 2019, Gill and Voloshyn shared WhatsApp messages to arrange payment.\n\nIn emails with the BBC, Voloshyn said Gill was getting paid as part of an \"advocacy campaign\" and that he was \"helping the opposition TV stations to fight for survival\".\n\nOne of Gill's eight offences involved arranging a meeting with Medvedchuk, which was broadcast on Kremlin-controlled TV, at the European Parliament in July 2019.\n\nMedvedchuk presented a so-called peace plan that involved talks between the Kyiv government and Russian-backed separatists who then controlled parts of Ukraine.\n\nSome were payments for making supportive statements about Medvedchuk to 112.\n\nOn two occasions he was asked to get other MEPs, who have not been named by the prosecution, to do the same.\n\nVoloshyn promised combined payments of at least €10,000 (about £8,600) for the favour.\n\nTwo of those present at Medvedchuk's Strasbourg meeting were Brexit Party MEPs Rupert Lowe and James Wells.\n\nLowe said Gill had asked \"me and other MEPs to attend\" an event with a \"very pro-Russian slant\".\n\n\"Due to his position in the grouping, I agreed,\" added Lowe, now an independent MP who had a  public falling out with Farage .\n\nLowe said he had no idea of Gill's bribery, calling it \"treasonous\".\n\nWells said he was angry with Gill because he felt he had been \"using people around him, like me I guess, to put bums on seats\".\n\nThe former Welsh MEP said he \"left probably after half an hour, because I didn't know why I was there\" and added the event now sounds \"dodgy as hell\".\n\n\"I had no idea whatsoever that there was any money changing hands,\" added Wells, who said he visited Ukraine with Gill in 2020.\n\n\"He's not just risked the reputation of colleagues and the party but also the whole Brexit thing. It ties into the conspiracy that it was all about Russia... which is just a load of nonsense.\"\n\nAfter Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Medvedchuk was captured by the Ukrainians and swapped with Moscow in a prisoner exchange.\n\nIt is thought Voloshyn, elected to Ukraine's Parliament as a member of the pro-Russian Opposition Platform - For Life party in 2019, left the country for Belarus.\n\nIn his emails with the BBC, Voloshyn insisted Russia was not involved in the Gill case.\n\n\"We never reported to anyone in Moscow or were ever asked from there about anything related to our co-operation with Gill,\" Voloshyn wrote.\n\nVoloshyn said his phone was examined when stopped by FBI investigators at Washington DC's Dulles Airport in July 2021.\n\nThat month, the Speaker of the House of Commons warned MPs against talking to Voloshyn and Niedźwiecki as both allegedly had sought the support of UK politicians to \"promote Russian foreign policy objectives\".\n\nThe US government sanctioned Voloshyn in 2022 and called him a \"pawn\" of the FSB, Russia's security service, and accused him of undermining Ukraine's government.\n\nThat same year, the UK government also sanctioned Voloshyn and Medvedchuk, accusing both of \"destabilising Ukraine\".\n\nAnton Shekhovstov, an academic expert in Russian influencing campaigns, told the BBC that Voloshyn and his wife were active in building European networks for Medvedchuk.\n\nHe said the strategy of getting MEPs to defend the pro-Russian TV channels was effective and the investment in Gill \"returned with profit\".\n\nShekhovstov said when Gill was asked to speak up for them in 2018, they'd become \"instruments of Russian or pro-Russian propaganda\".\n\n\"President Petro Poroshenko at that time did not dare to sanction the channels,\" said Shekhovstov.\n\nThe channels were shut in 2021 under the presidency of Ukraine's current leader Volodomyr Zelensky.\n\nGill invited Farage to Ukraine in 2019, but he declined.\n\n\"I said 'you must be off your rocker',\" Farage told the BBC earlier this year.\n\n\"I said it's one of the most corrupt countries on Earth.\"\n\nVoloshyn also said Farage had \"absolutely nothing to do with it\".\n\n\"I never met him in my life and never passed any greetings, let alone requests,\" he said.\n\nVoloshyn's wife Nadia Sass was photographed with Farage outside the European Parliament, but all involved say it was a one-off.\n\n\"Nigel Farage meets thousands of people every single year,\" said a Reform UK spokesman.\n\n\"Many hundreds of them will ask to have a photo taken with him.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Farage said  accusations that he is soft on Russia are \"just nonsense\" , added Putin was a \"really bad dude\" and said he would have Russian jets shot down if they entered Nato airspace.\n\nLord Beamish, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, said the problem of Russian meddling is \"constant\" and that the Gill case was \"not unusual\".\n\n\"There are other examples in Europe where similar things have happened\", he said.\n\n\"It's not just the UK.\"\n\nA Russian-based \"propaganda\" network allegedly paying unnamed European politicians, called Voice of Europe, was  shut down in the Czech Republic  last year.\n\nMedvedchuk was accused of being behind it.\n\nThe head of the Met's counter terrorism unit said Gill's case \"goes to the heart of our democratic values\".\n\n\"We will not hesitate to investigate and disrupt anyone seeking to harm or undermine these values and our national security,\" said Commander Dominic Murphy.\n\nThe BBC went to Gill's home in Llangefni on Anglesey for a comment but he declined.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."}]}
